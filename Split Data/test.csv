zQGOcOUBi6s,Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell,Science,The Immune System Explained I – Bacteria Infection,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQGOcOUBi6s,7 years ago,38M views,Science,"Every second of your life, you are under attack. Billions of bacteria, viruses, and fungi are trying to make you their home, so our bodies have developed a super complex little army with guards, soldiers, intelligence, weapons factories, and communicators to protect you from...well...dying. For this video, let's assume the immune system has 12 different jobs. For example, kill enemies, communicate, etc. And it has 21 different cells and 2 protein forces These cells have up to 4 different jobs. Let's assign them. Here are the interactions. Now, let's make this understandable. First of all, let's add colours to the jobs. Now, let's illustrate the cells. The central colour represents the main job of the cell, while the surrounding ones represent secondary duties. Now the immune system looks like this. Now the interactions. Isn't this complexity just awesome? For this video we will only talk about these cells and ignore the rest. So, what happens in the case of an infection? *Intro* It's a beautiful day, when suddenly, a wild rusty nail appears and you cut yourself. The first barrier of the immune system is breached: your skin. Nearby bacteria seize on the opportunity and enter your wound. They start using up the body's resources and double their numbers about every 20 minutes. At first, they fly under the radar, but when a certain bacteria population is reached, they change their behavior and start to damage the body by changing the environment around them. The immune system has to stop them as fast as possible. First of all, your guard cells, known as macrophages, intervene. They are huge cells that guard every border region of the body. Most of the time, they alone can suffocate an attack because they can devour up to 100 intruders each. They swallow the intruder whole and trap it inside a membrane. Then the enemy gets broken down by enzymes and is killed. On top of that, they cause inflammation by ordering the blood vessels to release water into the battlefield so fighting becomes easier. You notice this as a very mild swelling. When the macrophages fight for too long, they call in heavy backup by releasing messenger proteins that communicate location and urgency. Neutrophils leave their patrol routes in the blood and move to the battlefield. The neutrophils fight so furiously that they kill healthy cells in the process. On top of that, they generate barriers that trap and kill the bacteria. They are, indeed, so deadly that they evolved to commit suicide after five days to prevent them from causing too much damage. If this is not enough to stop the invasion, the brain of the immune system kicks in. The dendritic cell gets active. It reacts to the signals of the soldiers and starts collecting samples from the enemies. They rip them into pieces and present the parts on their outer layer. Now, the dendritic cell makes a crucial decision. Should they call for anti-virus forces that eradicate infected body cells or an army of bacteria killers? In this case, anti-bacteria forces are necessary. It then travels to the closest lymph node in about a day. Here, billions of helper and killer T cells are waiting to be activated. When T cells are born they go trough a difficult and complicated training process and only a quarter survives. The surviving cells are equipped with a specific set-up. And the denditric cell is on its way looking for a helper T cell with the set-up that's just right. It's looking for a helper T cell that can bind the parts of the intruders which the dendritic cell has presented on its membrane. When it finally finds one, a chain reaction takes place. The helper T cell is activated. It quickly duplicates thousands of times. Some become memory T cells that stay in the lymph node and will make you practically immune against this enemy. Some travel to the field of battle to help out. And the third group goes on to travel to the center of the lymph node to activate a very powerful weapons factory. Like the T cells, they are born with a specific set-up and when a B cell and a T cell with the same set-up meet, hell breaks loose. The B cell duplicates rapidly and starts producing millions of little weapons. They work so hard that they would literally die from exhaustion very fast. Here, helper T cells play another important role; they stimulate the hard working factories and tell them: ""Don't die yet, we still need you, keep going!"" This also ensures that the factories die if the infection is over so the body doesn't waste energy or hurt itself. But what is produced by the B cells? You've heard of them of course, antibodies. Little proteins that are engineered to bind to the surface of the specific intruder. There are even different kinds of antibodies that have slightly different jobs. The helper T cells tell the plasma cells which type is needed the most in this particular invasion. Millions of them flood the blood and saturate the body. Meanwhile, at the site of infection, the situation is getting dire. The intruders have multiplied in number and start hurting the body. Guard and attack cells fight hard, but also die in the process. Helper T cells support them by ordering them to be more aggressive and to stay alive longer. But without help they can't overwhelm the bacteria. But now, the second line of defense arrives. Billions of antibodies flood the battlefield and disable lots of the intruders, rendering them helpless or killing them in the process. They also stun the bacteria and make them an easy target. Their back is built to connect to killer cells, so they can connect and kill the enemy more easily. Macrophages are especially good at nomming up the bacteria which antibodies have attached to. Now the balance shifts. In a team effort, the infection is wiped out. At this point, millions of body cells have already died. No big deal, the losses are quickly replenished. Most immune cells are now useless and without the constant signals they commit suicide, so as not to waste any resources. But some stay behind: the memory cells. If this enemy is encountered ever again in the future, they will be ready for it and probably kill it before you even notice. This was a very, very simplified explanation of parts of the immune system at work. Can you imagine how complex this system is, even at this level, when we ignore so many players and all the chemistry. Life is awfully complicated, but if we take the time to understand it, we'll encounter endless wonders and great beauty.",6:49
dDagv6SA8nw,videogamedunkey,VideoGames,Knack 2 (dunkview),1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDagv6SA8nw,4 years ago,11M views,VideoGames,"You guys, I have to admit something. I don't actually like Knack. It's just become this running gag, you know, with the original joke being the PlayStation 4 launch. Pretty much all these games were also on PS3 and just as playable, except for Knack. A game so technologically advanced, it would annihilate the PS3's puny hardware limitations. [Reporter]: ""I want to talk about the development of Knack, and why, why this game had to be next-generation?"" (awkward silence) [Dunkey]: ""Fuck."" The game is a fucking disaster. It's a 3D platformer with de-emphasized jumping. [Mark Cerny]: ""So Crash Bandicoot, for example, we layout levels..."" [Mark Cerny]: ""...and there would be fifty jumps in a row you had to make..."" [Mark Cerny]: ""...or you couldn't get through the level and that's clearly not something that anybody can do so..."" ♪ Cuphead tutorial music ♪ [Mark Cerny]: ""Yeah, we have platforming, but we've de-emphasized jumps within that context."" Do you know what that means? That means when Knack walks over to a gap, it turns into a cutscene of him jumping over it. Welcome to the game Knack. Even this guy whose sole job it is to promote the game and make it sound good is lost for words when asked to describe what's special about Knack. ""Certainly, um.. I think it's, you know... When some people say that, you know.... is it necessarily..."" ""So you'll see, and honestly yeah, tha- yeah. I mean, that-that... and I... I... I..."" (Stuttering) ""And, uhh... I've seen people on the demo...  you know some people to use..."" He is such a garbage mascot. You look at Mario and Sonic, their design is so simple and iconic, that even if a four year old drew 'em, you would know who they are. Knack, on the other hand, is 2,000 little rocks that sort of shape into some fucking weirdo troll. Good luck drawing that shit, kid! The gameplay consists of walking into an empty area, hitting a guy once, and then walking into another empty area and doing it again and again until the game is over. There's even a part in the new one where they make fun of Knack for only having two moves. [Girl]: ""It's hard to believe you saved the world."" [Girl]: ""All you know are three punches and a kick!"" [Boy]: ""He can jump, too!"" *Wahp-waaaahhp* This game is a joke, and apparently Sony was not in on the joke. Knack 2, on the other hand... is a MASTAPEECE!!!
♪Here come the money♪ Ohhh! Look at the graphics!
♪Here come the money♪ LOOK AT THE GRAPHICS ON THAT THING!!!!
♪Here come the money♪ [Knack]: ""Knack is back."" You can play as Ice Knack! ICE KNACK, ladies and gentlemen! [Knack]: ""Ice is nice."" It's like the gameplay of Knack, but with the storyline of Transformers! Is Knack 2.. ""Um... Um... I"" ""Yeah so........"" Knack has to fight the High Goblin, okay?
♪Here come the money♪ So he can make a robot to fight a laser!
♪Here come the money♪ OKAY?!?!
♪Here come the money♪ ""Umm... I'm just, uhh..."" ""really curious, though, about, um..."" ""Like umm... But, like..."" ""Knack 2..."" Knack even has a NEW MOVE!
♪Here come the money♪ Dynamic Combat!!
♪Here come the money♪ Couch Co-op!!!
♪Here come the money♪ Family fun!!!!
♪Here come the money♪ Huh, interesting. Doesn't look like Bayonetta has family fun. Probably because this woman is a fucking whore! Look how good I am at Knack 2. That's how you know it's good gameplay. [Boy]: ""You got this, Knack!""
[button mashing in the background] [button mashing in the background] [Boy]: ""Show us how it's done!""
[button mashing in the background] [Boy]: ""Good job, Knack!! Keep it going!""
[button mashing in the background] [Boy]: ""That's it!""
[button mashing in the background] [Boy]: ""Keep going!""
[button mashing on the background] [Boy]: ""You almost got it!""
[button mashing on the background] [Knack grunts] [Girl]: ""So strong."" [Boy]: ""That's Knack for ya."" I give Knack 2, my first ever ten out of five and that's just for the graphics alone, okay? Don't even get me started on the storyline! [Outro]",3:25
A4_auMe1HsY,videogamedunkey,VideoGames,Difficulty in Videogames,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4_auMe1HsY,5 years ago,14M views,VideoGames,"There are so many games that struggle to find that perfect balance between baby mode, challenging, and frustrating. Ideally, your game should land right in the middle there, next to Donkey Kong. But where this all gets muddled up is with the addition of multiple difficulties, scaling difficulties, overpowered techniques, exploits, ranking systems. It gets really messy when you start examining what's fair, what's bullshit, what should be easier, what should be harder... There's so many variables and it's largely subjective to each player's skill level that I don't even know where to begin with this video. How about Halo 1? One of my favorite single player shooters. It offers you four difficulties. Which, if you're a grown-ass man still playin' video games, still playin' Halo 1, you need to cross these two off right now, let's be real. Now, playin' on PC with a mouse and a keyboard, I could just barely, after about 700 deaths, just barely squeeze my way through this game on legendary. It was fucked up. Halo 1 on legendary changes a man. Then I went back through on heroic and whooped the game's ass. But, this is my problem: which difficulty did I enjoy more? Legendary was more challenging, but guns like the assault rifle became obsolete. Most of the time, you're forced to use the plasma pistol, which is... Is... I hate the plasma pistol! This shit is stupid! On heroic, however, you have much more freedom in how you approach the game, but after playing on legendary, it just feels like a cakewalk. ""The Covenant are putting up a real fight."" And a lot of games have that irritating gap between ""kind of hard"" and ""fucking annoying."" You want the game to push you to your absolute limit, and force you to experiment and find out what works and what sucks is when you find out what actually works just isn't that fun. Variety and options are sucked out of the game. You have these severe difficulty spikes that feel overlooked by the developers. And what happens is the player starts pushing back. You notice the cracks in the game's design. You abuse the AI. You learn how to stop enemies from spawning. And when you push the game to its limit, sometimes, it cracks, and your enjoyment is ruined. Mario. Mega Man. Shovel Knight. These games have one fixed difficulty, so you know the experience is entirely tailored around what you're playing. Without a doubt, it's the way the game is meant to be played. It doesn't always result in a perfectly tuned game. But it does lend a huge sense of legitimacy to what you're doing. Players should have options in how they approach a game, but letting you pick how difficult the game is maybe is just a step too far. It's like my man Tupac says: ""No one man, should have all that power."" Bioshock 1 on hard, Uncharted 2 remake on crushing, Mass Effect 2 on insane, these difficulties just nailed it for me. I think they're perfect. But then you have all these other supplementary difficulties that end up being inferior ways to experience the game. What's really smart, are games that are easy to pick up, but difficult to master. Let the player get a hang on what's going on, and then continually ramp that shit up until it gets sadistic. Take Mario 64. Uh, not the hardest game ever made, but people just go nuts on this game, man. Far beyond what is actually expected of you. You want that depth, that margin for improvement. It keeps the game alive. You don't want just a static cap where you don't feel like you can't get any better at the game. When you encounter a poorly designed difficulty, you start second guessing yourself. ""Is this all Lyric has to offer?"" ""A challenge would be nice."" ""It's over? Huh. It's over."" ""...whatever that was."" ""I never wanna go through it again."" You say, ""well if I can't lose, why isn't this just a movie?"" Or ""why am I wasting so many hours just trying to beat this one bullshit part?"" ""What the fuck?"" Why am I wasting my time playing this shitty game? Why do I even play video games? Why do I even exist? Now, when Kirby's Epic Yarn is causing you to have an existential meltdown, that's when you need to take a break and say, ""this game is too easy."" ""I need to go play some Donkey Kong Country."" Now, in this game, all I'm thinkin' about is ""man, I gotta fuckin' kick this beaver's ass."" Basically, guys, what I'm tryin' to say with this video is that LEAGUE OF LEGENDS SUCKS DICK. IT FUCKIN' SUCKS",4:58
kFz9afj8lu0,Marques Brownlee,Tech,Can You Actually Game in 8K? (RTX 3090 Gameplay!),0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFz9afj8lu0,,9.6M views,Tech,what's up mkbhd here so can you game in 8k and would you even really want to that's the question that i'm going to try to answer with this video which you guys know what that means uh this video is gonna be 8k what the whole thing yeah the whole thing it's going to be rough on the processing but hey we're doing it look with all the hype about these consoles though with the ps5 coming out with the xbox series x and i've done videos about both of them this sort of conversation started to drum up again where did the pc games really do that much more than console games can these new consoles essentially be pc gaming and you wouldn't be crazy to think that by the way a lot of what we've seen with the new consoles as people try to decide which one to upgrade to have shown a lot a pretty big generational leap and so we're impressed with that but that's when the pc gaming community gets in my ear and they're like hey marquez look that's cool and everything but the real power still comes from the real computer so of course this wouldn't be an mkbhd video on 8k gaming without a little bit of an exclusive so this is the first time anyone's seeing on camera the new nvidia geforce rtx 30 90. so this is the highest end in nvidia's new 3000 series it's a gigantic huge graphics card uh but this is the top of their new lineup and this is capable of things that no new console will even really be able to touch of course we're talking about 8k gaming now of course frame rate is king and i've said that myself i said that in xbox video but if you want to maximize detail and immersion in every possible way in this gaming world you also need high resolution and so that's why we're trying to answer the question can you even game right now in 8k and if anything can do it this can now you may remember an older video where i did try to game in 8k that was three years ago believe it or not and looking back it was worth a shot we had the dell 8k monitor we had a powerful computer but there were a lot of workarounds happening for one you needed two cables from the computer to the monitor and it was stitching the whole thing together and when we finally got it running i mean it ran at 8k technically but you saw the footage it wasn't amazing but now it's 20 20. so we've got to step our game up like mr beast would want us to so remember this this is the 88-inch 8k oled tv from that dope tech video it's back and main gear has also stepped up their game so this is their f-131 so this is their custom computer basically built around the 30 90. so if the 3090 is as nvidia says built for 8k gaming then the rest of this computer's got to be built for 8k gaming too and it is so intel core i9 10900k so that's 10 cores 3.7 gigahertz base clock turboing up to 5.3 gigahertz you got 32 gigs of fast hyperx fury ram in here an msi mpg z490 gaming motherboard they're always great with names and then a terabyte samsung nvme ssd the 970 pro is the boot drive and then there's another two terabyte ssd for mass storage you know for stuff you don't need to access quite as quickly so it's all in a custom built aluminum chassis you see the rgb in there you see that mkbhd logo the matte black outside the tinted glass and the side panel this thing means business well not not business i mean unless unless 8k gaming is your business then that's a pretty sweet business anyway let's get into it also don't worry this isn't a review of the new card there are no benchmarks in this video this is just about 8k gaming but i'm sure we'll have all of that and more very soon when the linus tech tips video and the hardware connects videos drop matter of fact i'll link both of those below when they do actually drop their videos about the card because i'm sure people are interested in that but also i think it's pretty safe to say this card will probably crush synthetic benchmarks all right so we got a little setup going here the main gear computer on the desk next to me and the 8k tv in front of me i want to show you guys something really quick though so on this built for 8k graphics card it's got hdmi 2.1 ports like i talked about and that's what enables that single cable to do 8k out and this is the hdmi cable we're using and uh if you look at it it's a little thicker it's a little more uh averse to like bending uh but this is the type of cable you'll need to get 8k through a single cable to the tv and now if i go ahead on the desktop and check out display settings you can see there you go 76.80 by 4320 is the resolution we're getting so we're ready to play alright so we got a few games installed and i want to play first one i want to show is forza horizon 4. i've been a driving game type of person for a long time sports games and driving games but i'm pretty sure seeing all the detail of the map and the car in a driving game is gonna be a major advantage to having this many pixels and there's this pretty sweet demo mode that we'll go through that has like four different seasons and a bunch of different cars and it's a pretty sweet demo okay so now we're in the game and i have the controller actually connected this intro though i think when they make these they don't render these at 8k so this is less than 8k i think this is either 4k or maybe 1080p it doesn't look as good as 8k gaming but let's go into video oh there it is right off the bat 8k 60fps all right here's what i see oh the center festival and even this i think i don't think we're 8k yet but it looks so good ever you want to be that doesn't look aka your dream all right we're almost there about to drive a sena directly into a giant screen let me show you this is definitely what's happening [Music] horizon is here to stay all right so right off the bat it's telling me we are like locked at 60 fps so in the autumn setting i'm seeing like all these leaves on the ground all the leaves on the trees all the detail in the sky it's stuff you would still see at 1440p or 1080 but it's that much crisper and i'm driving a little bit recklessly while trying to talk at the same time oh god a cena would not make it through that all right let's see what inside the car oh i cracked the windshield already beautiful wow that is the mclaren steering wheel for sure it's not exactly what my hands would look like but that's that's pretty good okay now you get to winter i've done this before the winter is insane you see every little snowflake falling on the screen everything no matter what perspective you're in you're getting snowflakes oh wow okay still pretty much locked at 60fps if we wanted to go higher we'd need a higher pressure rate screen then there's these little smoke things that come up and the smoke i don't know if it looks as realistic but like once you start to game at 8k you start to notice like every single little thing the developer decided to put in the game it's like when you watch a high-resolution animated movie and you know that everything in the movie had to be intentional because it had to be animated in it's kind of the same thing with this game like everything you see on this map and everything you hit with the car and everything that falls out of the sky it's all very intentional to give you a more immersive feeling and you notice all of it like all these fences i'm hitting in this dirt and splashing all right let's see if i can actually get some some good times in in this demo while the lasers fire into the sky distracting me all right cutscene i feel like you can kind of see it shift down to 1440 or 1080 in the cut scenes and then back up to 8k when the gaming starts again because it's pre-rendered stuff here all right yeah that's not 8k wow there is a k it's very clear when it turns back on all right guys this will be easy just don't miss a checkpoint this bikes with the smoke and now it's just a lot of leaks lots of textures the fans in the back of the car let me get in the car for a second so sick all the water droplets on the screen too each of them has a reflection in it of the world behind it like as if you were actually looking through a camera back here all the water droplets on the top of the car i'm loving this i would be if i had this setup at home i would never stop playing this at 8k has the gpu struggled yet okay now we're down to 50 fps right 96 but like when there's that much stuff happening on the screen at once i'm kind of not shocked you're pushing a lot of pixels 30 plus megapixels for every single frame a lot of wind looks like i'm the only one left god that's good oh that transition though this is it horizon and then this is the last part of the cutscene it's summer we're back in the center i'm pretty sure again this pre-rendered part not quite and then it switches to ak wow oh we're flying oh we are flying we got to catch the centenario and the bugatti up there while the jets and the leaves and everything distract me holy moly like how the speedo is in kilometers per hour but my my actual attack is an mph catch the bug catch the bug that was way too easy i shouldn't have caught the bug that easily oh boy i can tell you as i'm distracted by the interior of this car from being in high-end mclarens that's exactly what the menu looks like when you're driving the car you do not want to miss out on watching this get around i mean the car sure but someone's got to be handling that thing final street that's fun i'm telling you you can tell when it switches from the pre-rendered like i'm gonna say 1440p looking cutscenes which look amazing right into the actively rendering gameplay i swear you can see it switch and it looks really good when you actually get into it alright let's try another game all right this next game is called control ultimate edition i'm already in the game right now and it's showing in 8k 52 fps so i'm just looking around here and this animation of hitting books i think is hilarious um but also i want to show you something real quick so if i go into video settings options and switch render resolution so this is other things in the environment that it's rendering out to 5k you can see if we resume the game now now it's actually starting to work the gpu i'm down to 21 fps the clearly what it's rendering back there is super high resolution so if i'm trying to see every single detail you're you're going to be losing frames 21 fps now but when i have the actual resolution of the game set to 8k which it is and then render resolution of the world set to 2k maybe even let's go 4k and see how it does resume game 36 fps so i think really if we're going to have the best experience that's going to have to stay at 2k so it's not invincible the card itself isn't going to literally do anything you ask at it so you can see now the world is a little lower resolution but i mean clearly the character is still high quality and the game is so high quality let's go out this door this has been a creepy game oh oh oh what is this floating what bro i okay okay okay this is where it's gonna really show that i'm not actually a good gamer oh god how long till i die do the thing oh okay well exposed i think you can tell this is this is the type of game that would benefit from i think a little bit higher fresh rate like the the driving game obviously higher refresh rate but gaming is like full immersion you need the detail also um this is the type of game where if you're really just trying to get immersed and truly horrified by a horror game like look at these look at these textures look at these textures all these are so high quality the reflections the character herself and i when i when i go up to like a piece of glass and you can see her reflection in the glass too like that's the type of stuff your eye expects to see when you're actually somewhere where there would be a reflection so this is pretty sweet all right i have learned a lot i think i'm ready to give a conclusion to answer the question in the title of the video can you game in 8k yes especially if you have a 30-90 you can handle pretty much any game in pretty much any resolution now the world of gaming in 8k is not just a great gpu and a great game you also need an 8k display and that world of 8k gaming monitors doesn't really exist yet so that that little piece of the puzzle that's less to plug in is still not very mature yet we had that dell ak monitor years ago we have this lg 8k tv that's thousands of dollars you probably still don't have a need to try to game an 8k yet in 2020. but if you do actually have the right setup gaming can be spectacular at a higher fresh rate or high resolution if you have the right setup and this is more than enough to be the right setup i'm just i just want to get like a comparison now between the best that the consoles have to offer because i've been somewhat of a console gamer for the past couple years you see me play 2k all the time you see me play need for speed all the time things like that i'm just trying to figure out how big is the difference between those games on say a 4k tv versus the 8k stuff that this is kicking out so far really good stuff and yes if you're a pc master race person you will be able to say the consoles can't do this officially kicking out 60fps at 8k it's glorious it's beautiful so that's been my experience thanks for watching catch you guys the next one peace,16:21
6Lj_gFyI1Qs,Car Throttle,Automobile,How A 700bhp Evo Saved My Life,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Lj_gFyI1Qs,6 years ago,4.8M views,Automobile,my name is John Livermore and I own a Mitsubishi Evo 9 m RFQ 340 I started out when I was younger the dream car would have been a Lamborghini probably a cantar but then as I grew up I started to get a lot into the Japanese car scene probably because I lived in Asia for 10 years and the Evo was one car that you always wanted I did the usual the remap the twin play Freeport solenoid French exhaust and we got a run in about 400 400 so then we went for like the manifolds things like that and we managed to get her to about 4:30 4:30 and that's where my engine tuner indigo GT Antony there said to me okay they were kind of on the limit now of the car and he wasn't wrong because I was out I'm going to play one night and launch the car and the whole rear end decided that he didn't want to be inside anymore and I lost the rear deer propshaft things like that and that's when this died but at that time without me knowing I was I was also going through a cancer but I didn't know that I'd cancer the moment I find sort of found out and I was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma it was time to build that Eva and a lot of focus was put on the Evo during my chemotherapy and my cancer treatment we parked the car up and my mate Lance who helped me build it every step of the way he was there blitzie from start to finish um he got underneath the car straightaway and he was like me rediff propshaft so I got straight on the phone to indigo and it was I think it was off 11:00 at night and I'm like down the phone rang and he going talk to America because I want to read if I want this I want that so yeah call me in the morning spoke to the next day we ordered the rear diff from America we started to rebuild the exhaust because it took out the center section of the exhaust when the prop shaft went and at the time I just I had my carbon company which is a diver to our we just started that and I had a small warehouse full of Evo parts that was waiting to go in the car but I just never got around to the right time to do it and I'll always remember Lance knocking on my door one morning because at the time he lived next door to me and he knocked on my door holding an Evo wing made out of carbon he just said yeah we're gonna carve in the car and I was like good thinking now's the time and the first stage of this build was just to get the carbon done so he did the wings the bonnet the boot the doors all the interior it was literally like a ratchet set screwdriver set couple of floor jacks some axle stands and we made that although I was there and I was helping I knew I wasn't my child anyway yeah because I mean after a session of chemo you're not the strongest guy in the world but everyone rallied around you know and it while the car was being built it was also a case of if I was down in the dumps from a treatment or having a rough week I just had the help and it and it was just nice to know that I had friends around that I had friends who were going to be there through thick and thin the positivity of having someone else to focus on and knowing that all my friends who were involved we're always there for me no matter what no matter what time of night no matter what time of day if something needed do it on the car or if I weren't great in myself that they'd be there you know and that kind of gives you that strength from that positivity that I think you need to come out of that positively like when I first found out that I had cancer in all fairness I'm one of them guys that will always put a positive spin and take the mick I kind of decided that I was going to approach the cancer in the same way as I approached everything else that made me feel down in my life I just made a joke out of it really my mum bless her she was like awesome through the whole for the whole chemo and I can honestly say I wouldn't be able without her she was amazing during it but she'll often say how she was shocked at how we would leave chemo in fits of hysterics and laughing because it was the only way that I was going to get through it and for weeks leading up to to like having biopsies and things like that I'd be like working on the car with with Tom who used to come up on a regular basis and I'd be there and all of a sudden I just go off cancer mate can't do it gotta stop and he'd be like dude how can like why you making these jokes but it was for me it was just I had to put some sort of a light spin on it and a little bit of humor but yeah it was scary you know I mean I thought I think I almost mask that also with the humor the fact that no matter how you try not to think about it at the same time cancer takes lives like there's there's a lot of people out there who lose loved ones from cancer from the cancer I had and yeah it's frightening you have to prepare yourself to die because that could happen and then at the same time you also prepare yourself for a massive fight because you know that if you don't fight then chances are you're not going to make it through so yeah I just dug deep and I decided that I was going to be to annoy people still in yeah I still am at the moment when the engine main stuff nearly pain in and it was in the middle of winter it was really really cold it was December and I'd literally just come off a chemo session the week before so I was pretty rough and I really didn't fancy obviously sitting in a cold unit trying to spray the car and paint the car and all the lads rallied round and I think they was a they was they was there till like 2:00 in the morning finishing it off making sure that the car was right sanding it down and then the next day they all they all woke up they all turned up again and they sprayed the car like all the bay and stuff ready for the engine to be dropped back in I just thought kept my head up and I knew that I had to fight but I mean there'd be some sort of days where like you just wake up in the morning and you just be sat sat in bed or whatever and all of a sudden that could dawn on you that these moments could be gone soon and you won't be here anymore and that whole sort of legacy issue and things like that but then that helped to get the car where it is now you know and just to just ply everything I had just plow it into making sure this car was finished so if I did go then there was something here that people would have to remember me by it's running 702 break 590 odd foot-pound of torque it's a precision 66 6 turbo it it's just add a lot of money so I've thrown at it I understand that I'm like but but it it's not just the money bill I mean this thing has been built with these hands and the hands of my friends and I just think unless you've actually bonded with your car like you've gone out for the day in your car you've hit an icy road especially in this and where I live I mean I'm surrounded by like North Wales countryside I'm like 20 minutes out laughs an ebow triangle and I'll always remember one day it was me in the car we was up there nice and quiet and obviously I was sticking to the speed limits and having a nice day out and there was just a moment when I just thought yeah this is awesome and this is what it's all about just flying along I had my friends there as well in their cars and we was all just enjoying a nice drive and it just kind of dawned on me that this is why I'm into cars it was that moment that made me realize I was into cars if you've got friends and family around them use them cause that's what they're there for they're there for you to be able to look at them and gain strength from for them to give you strength and to just get a positive goal in your mind even if it's something that like you've always wanted to do just keep that goal in your mind and just work towards it there's nothing better than hearing the loud pedal and opening her up going down the road here in the wastegate and the turbo boost and all that stuff I mean that's why it was really built for taking my time with life now a little bit more and sort of I know it's very cliche but I'm enjoying the things that I did take for granted before and I'm on it and I'm accepting that I used to be very very goal orientated and I still AM goal orientated and I put a lot of effort into my businesses and things like that but we recently they're taking a little bit of a backseat just so I can be me and do me yeah everyone knows who who should know just like thank you to me I can probably see her and say yes this card did help save my life really nice noise and it looks insane just that massive wing behind me just makes me giddy like a schoolgirl,9:15
7UwigY4SjKY,PBS Space Time,Science,Quantum Theory's Most Incredible Prediction | Space Time,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UwigY4SjKY,3 years ago,2.1M views,Science,"[MUSIC PLAYING]  Thanks to the
Great Courses Plus for supporting PBS
Digital Studios. Let's talk about
the best evidence we have to the theories
of quantum physics truly represent the underlying
workings of reality. [MUSIC PLAYING] Quantum field theory is
notoriously complicated, built from mind-bendingly
abstract mathematics. But could it be that the
underlying rules that govern reality are really
so far from human intuition, or a physicist just showing off? For better or worse,
the physicists are definitely on
the right track. We know this because the
predictions of quantum field theory stand up to experimental
test time and time again. Quantum field theory
describes a universe filled with different quantum
fields in which particles are excitations,
quantized vibrations. We've talked about
QFT many times before, starting with the very
first quantum field theory, quantum electrodynamics. QED talks about the
electromagnetic field whose excitations give us the photon. The calculations of QED describe
how this field interacts with charged particles to give
us the electromagnetic force, which binds electrons to
atoms, atoms to molecules, and therefore, you know,
allows you to exist. QED is a much deeper
and more complicated description of
electromagnetism than the simple opposite charges
attract, like charges repel of classical electrodynamics. But how do we do it's right? Well, because it makes
some predictions that clash with the classical theory. And those predictions
are the most precisely tested and thoroughly
verified in all of physics. Today, we're going to talk
about the theory and experiments behind one of these tests,
measuring the G factor, or in simple English, measuring
the anomalous magnetic dipole moment of the electron. OK, first up, what on
earth did I just say? What is the anomalous
magnetic dipole moment? Well, it's just like the
regular magnetic dipole moment but more anomalous. OK, not helpful. Let's break down these
magnetic dipole moment thing. Consider a bar magnet. It has a dipole magnetic
field, basically meaning it has a north and south pole. Dipole, two poles. If we put a bar magnet in a
second external magnetic field, it'll feel a torque, a
force causing it to rotate to align with that field. The tendency of a
dipole magnet to rotate in an external magnetic field
is its magnetic dipole moment. Anything with a
dipole magnetic field has a magnetic dipole
moment is basically a measure of how much
it would interact with an external magnetic
field if one existed. Let's talk about this
dipole thing a bit more. Magnetic fields are produced
by moving electric charges. A perfect dipole
field is produced by charges moving in
circles, for example, a loop of wire with
an electric current or the planet Earth
with its dynamo core. But in the case of a
bar magnet, the source of its magnetic field
is a bit weirder. It mostly comes from the
summed dipole magnetic fields of individual electrons in
the outer shells of its atoms. And those electron dipole
fields are, indeed, very weird. As we'll see, their nature is
predicted by quantum theory, measure electromagnetic moments,
and you verify your quantum picture of reality. Electromagnetic fields seem
intuitive if you think of them as tiny balls of
rotating electric charge, except electrons
aren't balls and they aren't really rotating. As far as we know,
electrons are pointlike. They have no size. And it doesn't really
make sense to think of an infinitesimal
point as rotating. Nonetheless, electrons
do have a sort of intrinsic, angular
momentum, a fundamental quantum spin that is as intrinsic
as mass and charge. Despite not being the same
as classical rotation, this quantum spin
does grant electrons a dipole magnetic field. So electrons have a
magnetic dipole moment, meaning they feel
magnetic fields and act as little bar magnets. Electrons in atoms feel
the magnetic fields produced by their own
orbits around the atom. This results in a subtle
torque on these electrons, changing their energy
states, and resulting in the fine structure splitting
of electron energy levels. The fine structure constant
is named after this effect. And we talked about this
fundamental constant in an earlier episode. Thinking of electrons
as little bar magnets or as rotating balls of charge
is a nice starting point. But in the end, it's misleading. It also gives you
completely the wrong answer if you try to calculate the
electron's magnetic moment. So that electron diagram you
did in middle school, it's time to kill that idea just like
you kill your tamagotchi. In fact, weirdly, if you
measure the magnetic dipole moment of an electron, you get
almost exactly twice the value you'd expect for a
tiny classical sphere with the same charge and
angular momentum as an electron. This difference
between the quantum versus classical magnetic
moments for the electron is called the G factor. It's the number you need to
multiply the classical value by to get the right answer. So apparently, g equals 2. Experiments point to this but
so does the Dirac equation. This equation is the origin
of quantum electrodynamics and the first to correctly
capture the notion of quantum spin. It describes electrons as
weird, four component objects with quantum spin
magnitudes of half. That's a whole bunch of
crazy we talk about here. So measurements say the
G factor is around 2. And Dirac says it's exactly 2. Case closed, right? Wrong, oh so very wrong. See, even though the
Dirac equation tells us how a relativistic
electron would interact with an electromagnetic field,
it still treats this EM field classically. It doesn't consider the
quantum nature of the field. Only the fully developed
quantum electrodynamics, the first true quantum
field theory, does this. And QED tells us that the
quantum electromagnetic field is a messy, messy place. It seethes with a
faint quantum buzz, infinite phantom
oscillations that add infinite complication to
any electromagnetic interaction. This messiness messes
with the interaction of the electron and
the magnetic field to shift the G factor slightly. So it's not exactly 2,
it's 2.0011614 et cetera. That little bit
extra is the anomaly. And this is the anomalous
magnetic dipole moment. It's really incredible
that we can even begin to calculate the
effect of the messy buzzing electromagnetic field. But in fact, we can calculate
its effect extremely precisely and test this
through experiments, showing the underlying
truth of quantum theory. So one way to think
about this quantum buzz is with virtual photons. Quantum field theory
describes the interactions between particles
as the sum total of all possible
interactions that can lead to the same result. In the case of electromagnetism,
those interactions are mediated by
virtual photons, which are just a mathematical way
to describe quantum buzz. Every interaction with virtual
photons that can happen, does, at least in a sense. And the sum of the infinite
possible interactions defines the strength of
the one real interaction. And if that doesn't
make your head hurt, try thinking about it again. So yeah, quantum field
theory is a type of madness. And again, we've been
down that rabbit hole. In particular, we've been
at Feynman diagrams, which are our best tool for dealing
with the absurd complexity of quantum fields. They represent the
possible interactions of the quantum field by
way of virtual photons. And they tell you
which interactions are the most important and
which are insignificant. So you know, you don't have
to calculate infinity of them. A basic interaction of an
electron with an EM field is illustrated by this
partial Feynman diagram. An electron encounters
a real photon that could represent an
external magnetic field. And it is deflected in some way. But the same encounter
could look like this. The electron first
emits a virtual photon, then gets deflected, then
re-absorbs the virtual photon. Same particles in
and out, so it leads to the same overall
result. But now the electron undergoes
an additional interaction with the buzzing quantum field. We need to include this sort
of secondary interaction when we calculate, say,
the overall strength of an electron's interaction
with the magnetic field when we calculate the
electrons magnetic dipole moment and it's G factor. If we consider only the first
interaction I showed along with similar primary
ones, you calculate a G factor of exactly 2. But if you include this
secondary interaction, you get g equals 2.0011614. This correction was
first calculated by American physicist
Julian Schwinger in 1949. It was an amazing result for
the time, but a lot of time has passed since then
and physicists were not content to simply stop
at this first correction. See, there really
are infinite ways the electron can interact
with the EM field, with crazy networks
of virtual particles and virtual matter, anti-matter
loops between the real ingoing and outgoing particles. The more complicated the
interaction, the less it contributes to the
overall effect. But contribute they do. Over time, physicists
have included more and more
corrections refining the prediction of the G factor
to increasing precision. For each new degree
of precision, the number of Feynman
diagrams needed explodes. Schwinger did his 1949
calculation by hand. Since 2008, all
calculations are done on large,
supercomputing clusters. However, the ultimate arbiter
of any physical theory is experiment. To actually measure the G factor
with the same high precision as these calculations
requires some cunning. One way to do it is to
watch the way electrons process in the constant
magnetic field of a cyclotron, a type of particle accelerator. Electron spin axes are
always slightly misaligned with an external magnetic field,
due to quantum uncertainty in the spin direction. As a result, they feel
a torque from that field and persist like a top. This is called
Larmor precession. And the rate of this precession
tells us the electron G factor. And the results are staggering. The measured G factor agrees
with the calculated value to 10 decimal places. Now, I need to add a
little subtlety here to get from the QED
calculations to a value for G, you also need to know the
fine structure constant that I mentioned earlier. This is the fundamental
constant governing the strength of the
electromagnetic interaction of charged particles. This requires an independent
experimental measurement. So it's really the
relationship between the electron magnetic moment
and the fine structure constant that we're verifying. But that prediction is the most
accurately verified prediction in the history of physics. At it's heart, physics is the
study of the natural world. We make observations
of reality and then try to find theoretical
frameworks that explain those observations. If those theories
are good, they're able to predict things beyond
the observations on which the theory was built. The
better these predictions, the more universal and
presumably the more correct the theory. The theory of quantum
electrodynamics has been pushed to
the experimental limit and come out unscathed. That means that it and the
quantum mechanical principles on which it is founded are good
representations of reality. We have to conclude that we
are getting closer and closer to the truth in our
search for theories to explain the underlying
mechanics of space time. Thanks to the Great Courses

about getting close to the sun with the very recently
launched Parker Solar Probe. Emma [INAUDIBLE] asks about
how satellites and service electronics could
be protected given advanced knowledge of a
Carrington-like geomagnetic storm. So advanced warning
definitely helps a lot. Power grids can be shut down
to prevent major damage. That damage occurs when
powerful currents are induced in long range power cables. When those currents hit
transformers at power stations, those transformers can be fried. Just disconnecting
the transformers is enough to save them. There are various ways to
automatically dissipate excess current even
without forewarning, but that would take proper
investment in infrastructure to update our antiquated
power grid to the order of tens of billions of dollars. Satellites are tougher. Their electronics can
withstand smaller currents. But a Carrington-size
event, it's not clear. Presumably better Faraday
cages and integrated surge protections are the answer. Again, it requires investment
in long term stability. All of these measures
produce benefits outside of the next quarterly
report or election cycle. And that's the real impediment. Andrea Smith asks whether the
Suns million Kelvin corona temperature is caused by
magnetic reconnection. The answer is, possibly, even
probably, at least in part. So the mystery here is
why the sun's corona, the extremely diffuse layer of
material surrounding the sun, can be so hot compared to the
5800 Kelvin solar surface. It's pretty firmly
established that energy must be pumped into the
corona by magnetic fields. Just radiating it
from the solar surface would lead to temperatures
below 5800 Kelvin. Magnetic fields can do
the job in two ways. One is this magnetic
reconnection thing. When magnetic loops
extending from the surface break and reconnect
into different forms, they can dump huge
amounts of energy into the plasma of the corona. Another possible mechanism
is through turbulence in waves generated by the rapid
motion of magnetic fields. Francios Lacombe
drops some knowledge on the 1859 Carrington event. In his words, the
Carrington event was actually a pair of
coronal mass ejections, a lesser one that reached
the earth on August 29, 1859, and caused widespread
auroral activity, and the big one that occurred
on the sun on September 1, 1859, and reached the earth
17.6 hours later. It's been speculated that
the first coronal mass ejection cleared the way to
allow the second one to travel so quickly. CMEs usually take
several days to cross the distance between
Earth and the sun, and making its effect
even more powerful than if it had happened alone. Well, thanks, Francois. I didn't know that. Master [INAUDIBLE]
expressed his enjoyment at being mentioned
in the comments. Sebastian [INAUDIBLE]
cautioned him to enjoy this one, the second
time it feels nowhere near as good, speaking from experience. Well, master [INAUDIBLE],,
this is your second. How much worse was this? And what about you, Sebastian,
was number three worse still? Let us know in the
comments and we'll see how boring these
shout outs can get.",16:30

KSiZrKvHlVQ,CDawgVA,Blog,I Spent $2000 On Making A Yαoi,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSiZrKvHlVQ,,2.7M views,Blog,manga or Japanese comics have become quite popular within recent years some Unga series such as Dragon Ball Z one-piece Demon Slayer an attack on Titan are so well known that they've become solidified in pop culture but today we're not going to be discussing those types of manga we're going to be discussing a genre known as boys or as it's typically referred to as in the West yaoi believe it or not yaoi isn't just a word that will get you instantly demonetized on youtube it's actually an extremely popular genre of manga it's something I've discussed many times on my channel recently book Walker which is a company in Japan that works with publishers to distribute online manga they asked me very kindly if I'd creates an audio book based on one of their yaoi titles and of course I said yes now viewers of the channel will be getting deja vu I've done this before for one chapter of manga called under one roof with the Beast it was only available for two weeks and so many people did not get to buy it however this time it's one full volume of manga that's 165 pages over 14 minutes of audio book that I will be creating in one month and best of all it's on sale right now so I recorded every single second of production on this audio book to show you the nitty gritty the behind the scenes every single stressful aspect of creating a fully produced audio book with sound effects music and amazing voice acting I hope on my pop this is that journey I apologize for the shaky camera and the shitty audio I'm gonna be meeting with book Walker about five minutes while I'm actually 5 minutes late because of course I and they're gonna fill me in on what's happening with my audio book mainly he's pretty seen in my videos before she's the producer unlike last time where you only made a chapter you challenge you this time to make an entire volume for us and we're going to put in her store indefinitely but deadline is actually a little over a month first you'll need to transcribe the actual texts in the bubbles cast the voice actors have them do their lines record them add in the sound effects the music master makes it check for errors and deliver it to us are you sure it is the 5th of February and I've just started the first part of the process which is the scripting obviously I'll be compensating my actors and figure out how much I need to pay them I need to kind of get a rough estimate of how many lines they're all so I can think about the appropriate payment for them it also allows me to get more comfortable with the manga and get more used to the story and all these characters and their dynamic and even when I've been scripting a little bit I've been acting some of the lines out myself and how I kind of want them to be acted out later on I it's a lot of fun but yeah it's it's such a tedious process I hate doing this I'm pretty much just going through the manga page by page and then transcribing all of it last time there was 35 pages of manga and this time you have a hundred and sixty-five pages anyway let me go back to scripting now they may be all right we're done 37 hours I hate this I want this to go well and I know I was so worried last time and it worked out but there's so much more at stake this time there's a lot more dialogue as a lot more story a lot more actors to coordinate and I really want to make sure that if something is gonna be out there permanently with my name attached to it that it's good and I'm really really terrified of messing it up now the reason why you rarely ever see professional projects have casting calls is because most of the time it's only got mail it's their agencies it's a very very closed off thing I most certainly could do invite-only casting calls I have a very good network of actors that I could ask but what's the fun in that I want to make this a [ __ ] show I want to have toaster microphones amazing microphones amazing actors terrible actors I want everything I want you the viewer to feel like you had a chance to be in this because honestly I'm open to working with anyone who shows promise so we're gonna try our best to make the cleanest and best casting call document we can in a reasonable amount of time I [Music] will link to this down below you do want to see what this doctor would look like in the end and if you want to use it as you know maybe inspiration for your cast a common future I'm hungry Oh true cheese I just paid 30 bucks for a pizza that is roughly the size of my hand I mean this is the casting document and these are all the characters up for auditions I'll be voicing fujian CEMA to cassia the rest are up for addition same as the prints at the school and one of the main love interests bujji is one of its zoomies two best friends and is very quiet we have our main character at Zoo meet at Urbana who's a big softie and all main love interest we have Mizuki who is the main antagonist of the story and is jealous of CEMA and it's Sumi Tetsu is it's UMI's other best friend and he's extremely energetic and carefree the shop clerk is yes as you guessed it the shop clerk of the cat cafe the student is a reoccurring character and is on the school council he's a bit of a kiss-ass the band leader is it's a Bentley or do you expect the thug is a villain that appears in a flashback hopefully now that you're familiar with all the characters you should have an idea for what they should sound like in your head I've done it now I'm gonna tweet it and this is the scary Paul because you have this like full boding feeling like something is going to go horribly wrong I know it one but I just feel like something up that's really embarrassing I don't know what but do you fire I feel like that misses all right here's the moment go ahead tweet just got hit tweet it's ok call it it's ok the whole world would end just treat it is done out of my hands now I was an earthquake yeah dude earthquake see I realize a lot of you been watching this for a few minutes now and have no idea what this manga is about so let me explain it really quickly to you the story follows our main character to meet a two-burner he's known as the school bad boy he's big he's strong and everyone's scared of him but secretly he's a huge softy and he loves nothing more than cats and he loves going to cat cafes Samer takasho our other main character voiced by yours truly is the prince of this school he's charming charismatic and everyone loves him he suddenly finds himself falling in love with it Sumi Tachibana but it's sooo me being the oaf that he is doesn't really know how to feel about this it's umi has a bunch of friends fuji the hard-ass who never talks Tetsu the lovable idiot who is always too positive and there's the members of the student council who at every turn of trying to stop sailor from falling love with our lovable oaf it's Umi sama is pretty open about his feelings towards it Sumi and pretty much left the whole school know and people don't really understand why he would like the bad boy it's a really really cute manga with a really heartwarming story and and a sex scene at the end there's one of those yes that's been boys acted I won't spoil anymore as I want you guys to listen to the audiobook yourself it's really a fun story I promise you won't be disappointed all right back to the video welcome I've just gotten back from San Francisco I was actually going to record some of this in my hotel turned out I was way more busy than I thought I was gonna be at the control anime Awards a lot of fun but no joke the whole time I was stressing just thinking like man I've gotta get this done by the 20th I haven't even recorded any dialogue yet today is the day it's the part that I'm sure a lot of you been waiting for we're casting the characters it's been just over a week and we have a hundred and eighty two auditions Oh last time I did this I remember it took me like two plus hours and we only had 30 auditions I'm gonna just have a spreadsheet I'm gonna write down the names of the auditions that I liked the ones that I'm not sure of and any ones that I categorically don't like I'm just gonna delete straightaway that sounds bad but I cannot afford to be picky with my time here as I'm already thinking that this is gonna take all day which means I kind of like it what's this ensue me bonus mm-hmm what are you doing to me the plan included moaning I didn't even ask for it just for that I'll pour you on the potential I don't know if you're serious or not when you say you like me but if it's true I need to know it's weird fake emotion it's like he's 20% when I need about a hundred percent you know let me hit Holly it's for the thug what the hell are you looking at me like that for sounds like Elvis Presley no he sounds like johnny bravo that's what he sounds like I love it so much that hankerchief is so cute oh this was a hundred percent recorded on your phone you're probably too young to be auditioning for this this is an 18 plus project I just feel bad you know oh my god are you going to cry he's close to getting mizuki the way I had in my head but not quite that listen that concert was out of this world I mean their performance was so freakin cool see that was that was perfect that's the way I wanted it in my head why don't you come on in today why don't you come on in today why don't you come on in today I felt like I will edition what I had no idea what the line should have been so when I hear a take where someone does the exact same line differently like for example hi my name is Connor and hi my name is Connor notice I put the paws at their high if you sent me those two lines you haven't actually done anything different it's just a slight pause which doesn't really comment much John what we're looking for as a director it doesn't comment me on you know the quality of your voice how are you can deliver half the lines as I don't really consider a slight pause a big indicator of your ability but you know when I'm casting or I'm a director in my head what I'm thinking is if someone just gave me one take with no pause in that line I know I can easily just tell that person to add a pause when we're recording this guy is audition for literally everything oh holy [ __ ] amateurish Oh is this a friend of yours Tachibana that's perfect right he's got the warm quality his voice that I think is perfect for the shopkeeper oh my god are you going to cry you're going to cry I really like his delivery for music ooh but I just don't like his voice for the character he is indiscriminately stuck to me like glue everywhere I go telling me how much he likes me every time he finds me it's a never ending confession it's good it's good until I hear a good one I get so worried because in my head I'm just thinking they're all gonna be bad they're all gonna be bad but we're not gonna find the right voice I really like this voice I think his delivery could be cleaned up a bit in parts ba the voice is that no hankerchief is so cute he was so quiet why are you whispering this is how it should look okay this don't give me this good bad good bad good he's indiscriminately stuck to me like glue everywhere I go telling me how much he likes me every time he finds me well it kind of sounds like the movie trailer gosh what man you know yaoi it's so quiet look what is this I'm pretty sure if I slapped my bull's against the I think it would make the same noise Lee oh this is me here slapping my balls against the thing I just think that's still higher than than this ah thank you that audio quality is rough that handkerchief is so cute I like that that was good oh is this a friend of yours Tachibana he's been coming here a lot lately oh that's good why don't you come in today oh I did not choose the thug lines rather the fug lines chose me all right Alison your thug first what the hell you looking at me like that for how many seconds of silence did you leave nearly 5 seconds what the hell you looking at me like that for what the hell are you looking at and you're peeking in here what is this how do you do this to audio I don't even know how do you do this you missed the fug lines did choose here I really don't think you should have chose the back you're recording a tin of beans that handkerchief is so cute oh my god it's so quiet you have the record for the quietest lines then even audacity can't see it except with this I'm pretty sure my thoughts I'll picked up clearer in my microphone than what you've spoken to into your microphone Jesus Christ I can't wait to hear this Hey look are you recording this on your laptop not a bad delivery if it was for something else hi my name is bash and I'll be auditioning for the part of it sue me touchy Bonner I said I don't know if I said that right I'm gonna be giving it to take someone and I'll light it with 20 seconds in and I haven't heard an audition that kid is way too crazy about GATS why does he sound like sarcastic listen that concert was out of this world that sounds like you're being sarcastic to me if I told you listen that concert was out of this world you think wow Connor that must have been pretty bad huh that sounds like how my mother's audio sounds or me FaceTime and for a is normally a foeman you get when you record with your phone that's awesome hey look scary but hundred-percent sounds like a phone damn I'm good listen that concert was out of this world I mean their performance was so freakin cold mmm that's probably the best delivery of that line I think by a mile that we've had yet today's the day I become friends with that new Kitty Rui slow down my dude you had a great voice let it take the stage its indiscriminate stuck to me like glue everywhere I go whoa you like didn't say half the words in that sentence ma'am starting to sweat a little now we're getting close we're getting halfway I still don't have voices for some of the characters I already want scary well I like your voice yeah are you gonna cry you're going to cry that's probably the best music we've had yet the only one who's allowed to be by the president's side is me finally a mizuki I dig man man what a long day damn that was good too their performance was so freakin cool nails on one as well as well right now we've got a stop or the teacher will be pissed god damn it you nailed everything it makes it so hard to choose are you dumb or what after warning you all these times you still don't get it sounds like Stewie Griffin constipated what is this scary scary that was pretty good I like that Hey look can you speak a little louder Megan but I'm sure there's been points during this video where like you can see my face like light up the moment I hear them talk because you just hear it straight away if you know the lines gonna be good right you can just you just hear it that was nice nice nice get the last line John please please president take these cookies yes John good it's really good why does the audio sound shitty I want this to work out between us I know we can make it work once you're set up like oh this is a friend of yours Tachibana he's been coming here a lot lately we got an officer down I do not have an XLR mic but if you are considering and choosing me at all I do not mind investing an XLR mic Hey look Hey look other people talking in the background it's toaster dude I remember toast the guy from the last one being an only child with both my parents working during loan breaks who come back quality is not good enough at all that sounds like yeah like a toaster I always listen to it are you dumb or what after warning you all these times Tory you upgraded your microphone hell yeah the only one who's allowed to be by the president's side is me there's no venom in there man Torah come on I want a hair just like the only one who's allowed by the president's side is me I mean that was terrible but you know what I mean I want to hear rhythm I want to hear it building up I want to hear that they're just a hatred in this voice man come on hey it's Ryan who voiced ad Jin in our last project isn't it a perfect situation for the both of us I think he's a great voice for actually I think this is the most suitable gen voice we've heard and you're trying to send me viruses apparently he's indiscriminately stuck to me like glue everywhere I go telling me how much he likes me every time he finds me in my head I was thinking I was like Jin's voice is like really perfect for it sue me oh I don't want to have to cast the same guy again because I I feel like that's kind of like cheating you know I don't know like it's such a cop-out right but it's really good amazing please president take these cookies very good sir I am happy with that audition holy [ __ ] Kevin holy fair I've worked with Kevin before he's voiced in my Grindr video I'm expecting good [ __ ] Kevin nice he he actually put some exhausted as you would be if you were delivering your final song you know you're doing a set here you know okay Kevin I see you my name is Merlin and I'm a kid in from Texas my Tia auntie died me to do this so here it is I also am you a tape so she is helping me out with everything why would you send me this do you [ __ ] hate me what is history mo ah Marcos its history making my god [Music] my heartbeat okay thank you for the alot right now I've made a spreadsheet of all the voices that I liked I've made a note with the yellow highlights basically saying which ones stood out to me the most on the first listen through so we're gonna do is we're gonna go from I guess the least lines to the most lines and cast the ones and go like that you [ __ ] kidding me I was opening so many files that Google for asking something suspicious let's get back to it Jesus Christ anything no no this is your friendly reminder that you can purchase the audiobook right now by using the link in the description down below I kindly ask you that if you do buy the audiobook please make a new account and use the coupon

it sue me first and then build the whole voice cast around that voice but that's no fun if I just do the main straightaway right come on that's we'll do that at the end it's get from the top it's good heaven you really should try smiling like that more often oh that kid is wait yeah no no no I think I was just desperate for a name on the board when I started I okay we can knock that straight away next we have Blake that kid is way too crazy about cats doesn't like this maybe it's cuz of the time I had nothing good my home was I thinking can I trust anything that I thought was out of this world I mean their performance was so freakin cool we kind of nailed the delivery but I don't know if I like the voice he should try smiling like that more often that kids way too crazy about cats mmm it's too high for him listen the concert was out of this world I mean their performance was so free cool what do they see in that the first time do I lie to myself I think until you get that one audition that blows you away you you kind of just like look for anything in any in any of the audition you know what I mean listen that concert was out of this world I mean their performance was so freakin cool Oh too slow listen that concert was out of this world I mean the performance was so freakin cool so we have one two three four five six god I need narrowed it down by half listen of Patrick's again you should try smiling a bit more often that kid is way too crazy about cats listen that concert was out of this world I mean their performance was so freaking cool I like it a lot right because there's clear confidence in the delivery of this line there's no fooling around right I know exactly what he's going for I know exactly why he's giving that direction I know exactly how he came to that conclusion in his head he clearly understand that you know the character is kind of like throwing his arms back you know man he puts that in his lime you can tell he can he can just see the nuance in that line and I really really like that and I think with a lot of these actors either they they're the ones that I put us maybe either they they they get it to some extent or they don't damn it's hard damn it's hard this is really hard I'm only one character and I'm already struggling with choosing he should try smiling like that more often that kid is way too crazy about cats see that line was really weak what a long day aren't you hungry in the way he delivers the first and the second likes I think the third line is the easiest because there's so much expression going on and I think it's really easy for most people to channel into that but what is hard I think for most actors is really connecting with the mundane right with the boring with with acting that really is some of the hardest acting is just communicating just talking having a normal conversation he said try smiling like that more often that kid is way too crazy about cats oh yeah and I can't decide if I like that I can't decide if I like that I think it's really interests what he's doing I think I really like how he's delivered the line it's not how I was expecting but I just don't think it's what I want so it's between Wes and Patrick and I and I genuinely think objectively speaking Patrick does a more accurate portrayal and performance Wes really gets that last night he really nails it I think that's the best take we've had on it and I think when I do direct whoever you know does get it I'm definitely gonna want it the exact same way that he did it but I think you got to give tatsuta Patrick I'm really worried because I don't want to get in the position now for mizuki where I wish I gave it to Patrick but I think we have a lot more stronger takes on mizuki than we did Tetsu right one down let's get a music you know are you dumb or what after warning you all these times you still don't get it audio quality and I don't think I like how he's delivering aligns the only one that's allowed to be by the president's side is me wow that was really weak what was I thinking are you dumb or what after warning you all these times you still don't get it listen to how he delivers the wood times it's a little unnatural right listen to or what all these times he says the wood times quite old the only one who's allowed to be by the president's side is me it's me do I like it why did he choose that rhythm on the one hand I'm glad that I'm making clear decisions on which ones I want and don't want on the other hand I'm slightly worried that I'm being too harsh because I want the perfect voice are you dumb or what after warning you all these times you still don't get it did I like this oh my god are you gonna cry oh I like that that was a good laugh that was a damn good laugh are you dumb or what after warning you all these times you still don't get it too fast a little sloppy the only one who's allowed to be by the president's side it's me why did I miss this that that delivery was incredibly poor he squished all those words together and we really can't be having that man I hate all of that I you dumb or what after warning you Oh quiet times you still don't get it I like how he delivered it though but I can't hear what you're saying sir the only one who's allowed by the president's side as way over the top yeah are you dumb or what after warning you all these times you still don't get it hmm oh my god are you gonna cry this is why it's really important for your your first take as your strongest take because you know when I'm going through 200 plus auditions or when anyone else is going through that many auditions I promise you I promise you they're gonna 99% of directors the moment they hear the first take that's pretty the only thing they're gonna listen to only one who's allowed to be by the president's side it's me I like it dare I say you might be putting too much in it you know I think he might be going for it too much are you dumb or what after warning you all these times you still don't get it hmm I think the blind one was a little too much at the stop you dumb or what after warning you all these times you still don't get it so venomous enough you know I don't think was hatred in there that I want all right so it's between Eddie and Brandon right now I think objectively speaking Eddie's audition is better I think Eddie gets Mizuki closer than what I want them Brandon did but it's a big part I know it's unfair I know Brandon I've worked with Brandon I know he can easily get what I want out of Mizuki which is totally an advantage and definitely a problem of this industry that it's more about who you know that's so hard it's so hard I'm gonna break each line delivery one by one are you dumb or what after warning you all these times you still don't get it all right Eddie's first line overacted I think it's a problem I like the venom in it but he's too loud that can probably fix pretty easily with their action is what I'm what is one thinking Brennan vine one let's listen to Matt are you dumb or what after warning you all these times you still don't get it it's just not the line delivery that I wanted like it's going for something else alright music you mind to you from Edwards think that's the line that I think made me fall in love with really good it's exactly the kind of setting and the scene that I wanted to set in my mind I imagined this kind of like intense music playing and it's really like you're feeling the emotions from the side of it sue me and although maybe it's not actually like delivered like that in real life it feels that intense when you're being marked right I like that this is the Brannan's on - oh my god are you gonna cry you're going to cry it's a safe take right it's not too ambitious it's not overacting it's pretty much how I just asked the line to be delivered right the only one who's allowed to be by the president's side it's me way way too intense the only one who's allowed to be by the president's side is me like that pretty much maybe a bit more venom in there a bit more like nastiness but yeah I know one does that take one good they both got take one wrong take - Edward nails it right take three I think Brandon gets it spot-on damn and what's really making this hard as that I thought Edwards take on line two was so good it was so good to the point where it's making me like think if he I know if he can get to that point this guy can do it but then again he's over acted two lines and I well it's kind of worrying in an actor when you know that there's no restraint that I want to go through music his lines I actually want to read Mizuki's lines as I need to get a better feel for this character right now I thought I knew this character but clearly I don't know them well enough if I can't decide whose loses the better one I really really wish I had time to do callbacks I really wish I did I think the one positive I have out of this decision is that they're both fantastic they both kill it right they both are amazing and either way I'm gonna get someone who I think is amazing but I don't want the comments being pissed off of me cuz I know I normally had comments about this I'm gonna go what my gut says my gut says Brandon I think Brandon can do Mizuki I think you can kill it and I think with the direction he'll be absolutely insane Eddie if you're watching this you absolutely killed it my dude keep auditioning for stuff keep proving my man you are you are an amazing actor man and we're gonna go with the enemy that I know this time unfortunately all right the clerk I remember I really loved Mads for this one really like nodded when I heard Mads you know oh is this a friend of yours Tachibana he's been coming here a lot lately oh so good man it's that perfect kind of warmness oh is this a friend of yours talked about no - Stef oh is this a friend of yours Tachibana he's been coming here a lot lately nobody nobody nobody oh is this a friend of yours Tachibana he's been coming here a lot lately age is definitely my fan why don't you come on in today sounds like Goldman from House of the Dead oh is this a friend of yours touch Mona schooled why don't you come on in today oh is that a nice voice then why don't you come in today why don't you come on in today mmm mmm between bands and how old is this shop boy I will did he look to you cuz in my head if he's you know a little bit older that voice is perfect but if he's in his 30s he could look like he's in his 30s that voice doesn't fit so it's tough it's very tough polite middle-aged I gotta pull out the source material I think I'm gonna give the role of the shop book to Mads oh is this a friend of yours Tachibana he's been coming here a lot lately I think the warmness is perfect for the shop clerk and especially later on when he's kind of scheming with them in the story the hell you looking at me like that for what the hell you lookin at me like that for when I first heard it I was like no but then I kind of liked it it sounds weird sounds genuine ah man I'm broke yeah I quite like that actually what the hell you looking at me like that for mmm what the hell you lookin at me like that for man what do you say you mess with me prick yeah man I'm broke [ __ ] I really like that line that line looks good he should restraint he didn't try and go for it too much he knew the line wasn't this crazy thing right I want to hear them all side-by-side what the hell you lookin at me like that for what the hell you lookin at me like that for I really like Kevin's delivery but I think for this scene and how it is I think Jacob kind of hit the nail on the head I've worked with Kevin before I know he's a very competent actor but I think in this case the main thing that's the difference in my head is a Jacob sounds like he fits with the rest of the voices we have so far he sounds like it's a realistic thing in this world so I think I'm gonna go with Jacob for this one ah man I'm broke congratulations Jacob you're gonna be our thug number one an honorary role I'm sure everyone wants to be thug number one you know I bandleader I didn't actually get many that I like for this I remember that I love them were just kind of mad so let's just have a look now we've got a stop or the teacher will be pissed damn good takes man please I won't sing better than this I've already cast him I can't have a misfire all right everybody next is our last song concept art studios that's your name it's a mouthful it's a rock you're right it's a gem I hear the beauty and the nuance there needs to be polished a little bit all right everybody next is our last song that's a good line but listen to his first line it sounds like mr. poopy butthole from Rick and Morty and everybody is everyone having fun oh and then Kevin again man I feel bad for Kevin man he's been off for consideration 4 1 2 3 4 roles and I'd it's just not there you know alright listen to all the lines again hey yo yo yo it's everyone having fun don't like that he added the yo yo yo don't like that alright everybody next is our last song his voice coming just fits right that's what I hate about it cuz I don't necessarily think that this delivery is anything exceptional or good at all I think it's it's kind of matte if I'm completely honest I think it has a good voice for it I really want to pick Kevin I really do but I just don't like the voice man I don't like the voice alright everybody next it's our last song you know what it's only three lines why am I getting so stressed about this all right yeah I'm give it a concept ah I think his voice is the perfect voice that I want for it alright everybody next is our last song alright student this is a character that I'm I really enjoy I think he's funny as [ __ ] and I want a really goofy voice for it you know please president take these cookies yeah please president take these cookies please president take these cookies please president take these cookies mmm good as well this is the one I have labeled as my favorite this character is very cartoonish so I do want a kind of cartoonish voice to go with it you know please president take these cookies hmm think and he's my favorite so far please president take these cookies please president take these cookies that's good too and Kevin I'm gonna like Kevin as well I know I know I'm gonna like Kevin please mr. president take these cookies that was perfect that was exactly how the line is it's like you can hear the kiss-ass in his voice God we have like seven auditions that I like alright let's take it from the top again so it's now between Saif and Kevin I think not all the lines are over-the-top but most of them are please mr. president take these cookies that's literally the vibe of that line because it's like the whole scene is just a way to show that someone's kissing his ass wasn't this ass all the time thank you please president take these cookies I think Kevin has the voice and he he he can totally pick up on the kiss a sea vibe of the character so I think I'm gonna give in to Kevin please mr. president take these cookies - congratulations Kevin you finally got a role for now it's the big boy it's the main character the main character of the whole thing the character the most lines it's zooming and this is the one that I have to get right by the bandleader the student the thug all right that sucks but people are gonna notice as much ease indiscriminately stuck to me like no I know he's indiscriminately stuck to me like glue everywhere I go not imagine that PJ was my pre-existing favorite I remember getting quite excited about listening to his audition uh he's indiscriminately stuck to me like glue everywhere I go he's the main character he's the star of the show he the the audiobook pretty much relies on it sue me and I am hearing a lot of flaws in his delivery he's indiscriminately stuck to me like glue everywhere I go telling me how much he likes me we don't like his Annunciation and today's the day I become friends with that new kitty Rui I'm in a little slowed down a little more enjoyed this is making me worried now am I not gonna find a voice that I fall in love with he's indiscriminately stuck to me like glue everywhere I go telling me how much he likes me every time he finds me it's a never ending confession love the voice love the voice the thing is right is so this character is supposed to be the the manliest side to the character that I'll play I'm basically just gonna bring out but the Sebastian asked voice that I'm it's the British kind of you know the well I suppose you know I mean I guess so I need the voice to be as deep as mine if not deeper right I can't have it be like life otherwise I would have had to do it sue me pretty sure I really liked Ryan's today's the day I become friends of that new kitty really and I've worked with Ryan before I know he I can direct him to where I wanted to be I need to know tell me the truth you really let out that lines like simmer you know he let the line do its work dare I say I think Ryan is my favorite so far let me listen to Andre Martinez again he's indiscriminately stuck to me like glue everywhere I go telling me how much he likes me every time he finds me he was channeling that but it just wasn't coming out properly today's the day I become friends with that new kitty Rui doesn't sound excited enough I mean listen to Bluebird again he's indiscriminately stuck to me like glue everywhere I go telling me how much he likes me every time he finds me indiscriminately stalked it's one word there's no separation that we need that clear enunciation I like bluebirds voice it's good and the rest of it takes a pretty solid I just don't think he's as strong as the others I want multiple meanings on Ryan's up and I want PJ chemist's I want to listen them all back to back I gotta listen to this it's a never ending confession not bad it's a never ending confession mmm it's a never ending confession I listen to that and I'm just like what what is he going for like to me it's it's an amalgamation of takes and it doesn't sound right or natural you know it makes me doubt because when I hear something like that way the line is so odd and I can't really understand why they're doing what they're doing it makes me worry about directing them let's go back yeah let's let's Hill line two today's the day I become friends with that new Kitty rui what i want the line to be like is today's the day I become friends with that new kitty Rui you know I want their line to go up because you're excited it's your favorite cat right listen to what he does with it today's the day I become friends with that new kitty Rui I wanted their little little excited like Rui you know it's your favorite cat what's in the Rhinestone - today's the day I become friends with that new kitty Rui that was good today's the day I become friends of that new kitty Rui damn I'm my I was siting towards Ryan but now my siting towards multiple meanings I didn't think I was gonna do this but I think I'm gonna mark out PJ Kenny's but if it's true I need to know I really like light Ryan's line 3 I feel like he expresses it the best and there's a level of maturity that Ryan's line brings with it you know like it sounds like it's coming from a genuine place I don't know if you can feel that at home listening to the line I mean it's out of context and you know but I feel I feel the pain in that take you know it feels like there's more to it mmm another name listen to my one again he's indiscriminately stuck to me like glue everywhere I go telling me how much he likes me every time he finds me it's a never ending confession definitely the best line one I think the listener brands I'm one against to make sure he's indiscriminately stuck to me like glue everywhere I go telling me how much he likes me every time he finds me it's a never ending confession mm-hmm I think sir today's the day I become friends with that new kitty ruie I wish he included another taken I really do today's the day I become friends with that new kitty Rui I don't think any of them get Lyme too right lying to you is a slow burn it's a slope right today's the day I become friends with that new kitty really but then obviously in my in my opinion Ryan absolutely kills the final one so it's line one multiple meanings does better mine too both could be improved so a point to nobody line three Ryan wins he kills that line so they both do a line better but at the end of the day which line is more important to me the first line or the final line well there's a lot of general conversation and you know you're not always constantly hitting those emotional high notes so on one hand you could argue I could go with multiple meanings because he gets the everyday conversation a little better than Ryan but on the other hand knowing that an actor can go there and go to those depths and go to those really uncomfortable emotional spots is really fantastic and telling that okay if I can just give this guy the right direction he can absolutely modes of these lines he'll kill it and I really hope I don't regret this I'm gonna give the role of its Sumi to Ryan he's indiscriminately stuck to me like glue everywhere I go telling me how much he likes me every time he finds me it's a never ending confession congratulations Ryan you're gonna be voicing in another audio book of mine which I genuinely thought wasn't gonna happen this time so [ __ ] I guess we have our cast I'm kind of excited now I can't wait to record man there's so many talented individuals here and I cannot wait to get on call with these guys and get all their lines down I'm very very excited to do that glad to have you here today lovely to meet you yeah wow you're natural speaking voice is pretty deep yeah yeah I don't put it on it sir I just wanted to make sure we got the right delivery for them cuz I liked your addition but no one like mail to the three takes the exact way I wanted it so that's what we're trying to do today sure I like your overall the tone you gave it I've really let the voice you gave the character it sounds you know like it's real max is all a song the way you deliver that I really like that and the final line we got to stop what the teacher will be pissed the only thing I want to improve on that is just the enunciation oh I knew it I knew that was gonna be an issue yeah yeah good right why wait if you knew it's gonna be an issue why don't you fix it but like sometimes it's just like yeah I knew it flipped it I don't want to hear this [ __ ] but I won't flip it this time what we'll do is do two takes of the line at all right everybody next is our last song do two takes and then I'll direct you aright everybody next is our last song I love the energy all right everybody next is our last song we got to stomp on the teacher will be pissed I like you did this again you'll like your yogurt thinking if you let's try to take without breaths and then let's try one with breaths we got to stop or the teacher will be pissed we get stopped or the teacher will be pissed I won't be able to see it but do a smoke when you buy hafiz' line so we can hear that you're like you're like

out of my pocket don't any of that being picked up when the room is so quiet just having like even the slight change in your pocket will hunt upset be picked up by the sensitive ass microphone do I go British or do I go American as the audience you probably think on it you should have thought about this before you even cast yourself as the role I found you my Cinderella my Cinderella yeah British I think all rights just me in the booth oh my god 3 hours and 15 minutes to wash these lines out I found you my Cinderella I'm the council president same litter catcher there's something I wanted to tell you personally but don't sound real that don't sound like you actually given back about what you're saying I became interested just recently because I found out you go regularly I hate the word regularly regularly regularly my British ass accent doesn't work with the word regularly regularly regularly regularly because I found out that you go regularly because it's me it's me it's some eu70 something pages in we're roughly halfway and we've got an hour and 40 minutes left roughly so far I'm not like terribly thrilled with my performance like I I think the emotional lines I'm getting 100% like it's clear as day to me in my head I mean some of the other lines I'm just like I'm doubting myself it's kind of like in a test write a test that you prepared four weeks advance the moment you comes to the test you're so well prepared that there's like multiple answers in your head you're like where is it this or is it this other concept that I really understand and know well and you kind of like that I'm over answering everything and I'm doubting everything because I've prepared so much you know and it's kind of like that and it's it's really annoying but it is what it is you are still saving me get that emotional I need to get in my emotional depths right now bye-bye bye-bye bye-bye bye-bye all right all right all right all right two stories left one of them is just being with fine we can get through this easy easy let's go I'm not gonna record the sexy boy scenes on camera I don't want that being on film three hours of recording and we're finished with all the loans those orgasm sounds were weird never done that before overall not bad I really wasn't confident in some my deliveries and some of them I was just doing the line over and over again in the hopes that I was eventually gonna get something good but I really really wish I had a director to help me just really work through it and really stop myself from overthinking and being over critical of myself I know I can do this it's not that difficult I definitely have the skills to do this it's just sometimes you're your own worst enemy nice to meet you too yes that's the voice of the shop clerk I'm sorry that I emailed you just saying you have the role of yourself that must have been kind of annoying I imagine we don't have many lines but I'm sure we can work through them pretty quickly and get on with your day so funny thing um I just totally forgot I was voicing Fujii I knew I was but I totally forgot to record for him in the studio so we're doing it here Fuji is a guy who just kind of like hmm so I feel like very in touch with him as a character again look all this guy has his ha he has this forty lines in my god Fuji just say something mmmmmm that took us less than five minutes to do all the Fugees lines hello this character kind of pops up around the the whole manga at points so we wanted like a lot of noises super cartoonish really Dom really over-the-top alright yep ah go ahead and start with some noises could get some that a little more subtle as well like you like full-on shriek right and then I think I lost you your dear wind but that I like the sound of it please president take these cookies yep like like you didn't your addition very Agassi very desperate the police mr. president take these cookies you had it in the mister again forget it and maybe one with more stumbling and more desperate please take these cookies well why don't you try the one was like bleep please present please presents okay yeah I'm not gonna use that but I like you there okay we definitely have something here basically ten Tetsu is just the friend who's like super always energetic always wants to do staff I'm sure you like that you should so like to be she could move to definitely that's usually me I said now okay okay I what will do is uh we just try three takes every line and any direction and we'll go from there Oh found him hello each on so good damn dude I've been looking for you I'm starving come on let's grab lunch okay it's time to go you like exhaling while dragging him away as you see in this panel yeah okay time to go gonna like it really like deep exhale ik okay time to go okay okay time to go yeah with each other but wait up come back with all the other characters they've delivered the line and I've always had some form of criticism or oh let's try this but the moment he was delivering most of those lines I was just like oh that's that's the line like that's it so that's definitely talented guy yeah I can definitely see why he gets typecast for those type of characters alright okay here's what's happened right I have lines need to be redone I have characters that haven't been cast and I need the lines pretty much right now so I'm just gonna invite people to a discord server and we're gonna try and cast the role for them I think that would be fun and I kind of want to do something fun so we just reach out and we're just gonna do these chaos how are you a voice actor I do it for me personally but yes do you want to be a kiddo do you want to be a teenage girl I guess don't be a child all right you have one line right you're a baby all right that wasn't bad okay I don't kick you you're good I have it here the next person hey this is a little crude um yeah all right okay okay the whole ease with the wide homey all

everything now I'm talking to Masek oh he's gonna do the teacher we good we got everything good this is absolutely like the most chaotic thing but in 20 minutes we managed to get all the voice actors we needed and get all the lines perfect Wow what the is this project at this point hi today we're an ek bucura I need to go and redo my lines because I know I missed a bunch of lines my old you also corrupted at the end oh alright there's way more people in this building than last time they're playing drums really loud in that other room I'm a little bit worried dad sooo it's almost time for homeroom your face was the scariest part Tetsuo remember last time how I kept saying the word regular regularly regularly regularly well I have to redo that life because of course I do because I found out you go regularly I just turn this off now I'm gonna do the sexy parts hi we just finished recording or the audio went well I actually kind of like my lines more this time than last time I think I was just really in my own head last time I was just giving myself so much [ __ ] I really need to but overall I'm excited I feel like I'm basically done with this project at this point it's a big project it's it's it's it's massive and we're being asked to do a lot in a small amount of time for no pay I'm not being paid again to do this this is I'm only being paid per Commission so if you guys buy this I get money but other than that I'm kind of banking on the fact that people will buy this uh-huh please buy it we'll see how it goes wish me the best of luck weebs wish me the best bye hey what's up your beautiful weeps my name is justice Washington also known as say VA and I'm a voice actor content creator twitch streamer and I'll be doing the audio edits for you are my princess my job is basically compiling all of the raw audio into the finished product along with finding any missed audio and proofreading through any of the messed up lines so without further ado let's get into it so this is my workspace I use Adobe Audition it's one of the industry standards over here on the Left I have all of my files that's things from sound effects to voice-over to everything that I'm going to need also the full project in and of itself so all I'm doing here is taking the lines dragging and dropping honestly as easy as that just really tedious you don't need to keep that I'm also voicing in this too somewhere I think I'm one of the extras above there's something wrong with me one of the techniques I do is Foley I just record my own sound effects because sometimes you won't be able to find exactly what you want on the Internet I have some athletic tape and I'm just gonna start sweeping and swapping this stuff all right that might be wasting my athletic tape but whatever and that's the basic sound let's add some sparkles and funtime sounds all right we look at the comic we see what kind of fun things are done around certain characters where it's serious where it's not serious where there's background stuff and we add in where the sparkles are because this has a lot of sparkles I have a lot of sparkles in this sparkle chimes might work a little bit better they're a little bit longer last thing I'm probably going to do for this one before I start actually throwing other stuff into it is adding ambience track sorry the nurse isn't here so I did the best I could I liked that sound because it makes it seem more empty and makes it seem more intimate between them because this is just them two in one room there shouldn't be any other sounds but that putting in the room tone there just makes you realize how silent it actually is and it makes it a little bit more awkward here the last thing I do here is I search for the music for the scene like right there look at that that's that looks like Church come on that's cute I put it there that's how I do it basically really it's nothing okay this was totally my fault sure oh it's perfectly that's a pogchamp moment this audiobook should have been done and approved two days ago um needless to say a little worried so right now I'm gonna listen to the audiobook give my first reactions to hearing it cuz again I haven't heard anything I mean I recorded all the voices with people so theoretically I know how it should all sound but mixed it's gonna sound I imagined a little weird to me and a little foreign what if it's bad what if I hate it you know there's no going back if I hate this the perfect way to enjoy this audiobook and it is by far the best way is to read along with the manga if you buy the audiobook you get it with the manga so have them both up you can play it on your phone and then open book poker and and download the manga and read along if you want PC you need the same highly highly recommend listening to this while reading it'll make it a really good experience I promise I hope anyway I'm about to listen but that's the way we're gonna do it today today is cleaning duty with Tetsu and Fuji I'll just wait outside president - Kojo Student Council huh as president he's got to be busy the school festival is coming up - looking at him now he really is the school Prince change this [Music] here he comes that was close all right last chapter chapter 5 ready to hear them not oh yeah can I call you back in like 20 minutes top 10 worst times for your mom to call what you're about to hear you know yes yeah today should have been a day of celebration ah it's the 24th the 24th of March and today should have been crunch you know me celebrating finally getting the last of the audio book work done the audio book is completely done we finished it that we finished it two days ago this video was supposed to go live on the 25th of March I don't know what data is now I have no idea when it's eventually gonna get approved so I'm just sitting around and it's really frustrating because I had a lot of other videos planned that now I have to move around and ask other sponsors if it's okay if I can push them around and do all the stuff and I know this is totally stuff that none of you care about but it's just really frustrating when I poured like a month plus in work on this project on my own not to mention the work that other people have put into this project expecting it to go live on the 25th so now I have to write an email to everyone involved saying hey it's not going live on the 25th I don't know what its going live don't tweet about it don't say anything about it yet I'm so frustrated sad and angry I just so Donham I'm drained I'm sick of doing legs I just feel like no one gives a [ __ ] [Music] yes we did it I mean have flabby Soviets video but we did it finally you could buy the audiobook right now can I just take a moment to say thank you to everyone who helped with this project everyone who took part in this project all the links are down below to everyone who even remotely helped this project and thank you to you the viewer for sitting through this I don't know how long this video is but I'm assuming it's very long thank you for sitting through all of this I know it was a long and I hope you enjoyed every step of it I hope that you could find joy in my struggles and my stress and my anxiety I really wanted this to be interesting and memorable I hope we walk and if you did buy the audiobook which if you haven't don't do that use coupon code c-dog or I don't get paid even if you buy the manga and don't use the coupon code I don't get paid so please please use the coupon code c-dawg you need to make a new account for it to be eligible

make my money back I really love doing this it's a challenge it's stressful as hell but I want to do this again bigger and better each time and if you want to see that thank you I mean even if you watch this video that helped and that means a lot and I genuinely say this from the bottom of my heart thank you thank you so much for watching all of this video I I don't even have words to thank you

GTW8IplsKmM,First We Feast,"Food,Entertainment",Kevin Hart Catches a High Eating Spicy Wings | Hot Ones,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTW8IplsKmM,5 years ago,32M views,"Food,Entertainment","my lips my lips feel like they bleed and those going on hey what's going on everybody for first we feast I'm Sean Evans you're watching hot ones it's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings today I'm joined by Kevin Hart damn right you are he needs no introduction the new film what now yeah it was out October 14th yes and this ain't no Netflix special you guys had a budget yeah this is uh this is the real deal Sean you know we went all the way I filmed it at a football stadium which has never been done it's a dope thing to do made history 52,000 people and I actually put a mini action movie in front of a comedy show that gets me to the special so different and before we begin you tell this great story about how early on in your career you're a bombing on stage and someone pelted you with a half-eaten chicken hundred percent sure I figured all that the worst memory ever little sauce was on the - some of that sauce got my he and me with a buffalo wing my joke frustrated him to the point where he felt the need to stand up and throw food afterwards is never good you know it's never good and I say who threw it you know you expected to be quiet so you can say some stuff to just look like you're about to defend yourself and he was like I did [ __ ] good throw and I'm just good night I just gone sticky because it's so chicken wings won Kevin Hart zero I'm ready to even the score I'm ready [Music] so this first one is sriracha the first it should be easy to write so what now is unlike any comedy feature I've ever seen in my life with the sold-out Philadelphia Eagle Stadium looking like a damn Beyonce concert damn right it does you've said that you train like an athlete but you seem to be motivated like one two you want to hang a banner you want to put on the ring for me it's it's about history it's about making sure that last name heart means something when it's all said and done you know my kids I want them to understand not only who their father is but why he's in a position that he's in doing this particular movie this is putting me in position to become closer to the ultimate goal and and that ultimate goal is just history man is history history history so this one's Tapatio Tapatio take a bite of that that ain't nothing my top-of-t I ain't never baby my own hot [ __ ] thinking back on your jobs that you had before you were famous do you have fonder memories as a shoe salesman or that summer that you were a lifeguard somehow I was a lifeguard for two reasons first of all being a shoe salesmen was amazing but being a lifeguard that's where some of the funniest stuff has ever happened yes a little boy almost drowned on my watch because I thought he was playing and I'm you know the other lifeguard from across jumped in to save him and he was like heart what happened I thought in the plan not a good excuse kids play too much so there you had been playing like you were drowning just to get me in the water to go high right wasn't drowning it just so happened at that time he was drowning let's and learn this is oh you kept Echo Caribbean habanero who taught you the enunciation of this stuff goodness what did you call this I would call it the e battle that the star would eat would you say is you can what well you could take out Caribbean have in Europe I'm right we won't drink the tech go see that scab nicknamed we're gonna drink some of this tech Oh baby so everyone knows so mm-hmm this is tech Oh we get Hollywood whoo going up going up going up we out here now so everyone the Kevin Hart in 2016 starring in blockbusters nominating social media but I don't think a lot of people know how water hard that road is you know getting paid in french fries we've been in your car and one of the strangest tidbits that stands out to me used to do gigs at a place called Sweet Cheeks Sweet Cheeks where you warmed up the crowds trionic male dance yes first of all I don't want to buddy judging me okay you know my friends are looking at me differently they don't know the whole story but this was a different time in my life Sweet Cheeks was male strip club and I I wasn't dancing right yeah you know I would basically okay let me explain it so the strippers they would be stripping right and they would stop the strippers there but art fellows going to back you know they got to go in the back and change right so the name would go body changing and you guys so going we got some comedy and it wasn't really a good segue and it doesn't seem like it would be it would go from the male strippers there we go introducing a little cab the bastard that was my name at the time and I was on stage one time and as late as I pull your dick out wait a minute I ain't even about that I'm up here slinging these jokes I'm here for the joke life you know but they didn't want to hear that the name love is pain is good I'm saying it's not pain is bad well what's the marketing behind that I don't understand that okay let's go ahead mm-hmm oh yeah oh yeah oh [ __ ] so speaking of early on in your career one of the first IMDB credits you have is this film called paper soldiers we have a very unique project yes it was this Dame - jay-z Rockefeller production you star alongside beanie sigel and Memphis Bleek when you look back on that project and that time in your career what do you take away that was a good time man you know that's - beginning shots out - damn - damn - saw me perform and Caroline's comedy club he wanted to talk to me after told me he had a funny idea we meet we discuss it he said I want you to star in it he said I got some other comedians the other comedians and I got together Charlie Murphy helped write and navigate the story to where it could become a real funny comedy and beans came in and we developed something that was dope like it wasn't supposed to be but it was and ended up surpassing what we thought it was going to do and act as a vehicle for me you know paper soldiers is one of the reasons why I was able to get a tape and get management you know go out and get an agent you know just get people to see that there was a talent behind a comedian so it acted as a rule for me at one point which was good this next hot sauce the way you're I'm the hot one show okay you're not the only one enterprising here so this is y'all you decided okay this is y'all concoction yep this is our concoction okay no how would you is in the middle so it's not crazy like this stuff coming up but it's like it's funny that you say that because it's a transition sauce so it's sweeter it's not gonna you know okay gonna set my ass so it's not gonna set your ass okay all right I think I still taste a couple of the other ones too because every time I take another bite comes back yeah the fire come back well I'll put it off for a second and then actually come back like right now I won't drink the milk so the next thing is called explain that Graham and what we've done is we've done a deep dive on your Instagram pulled a couple interesting pictures that we just need more context we need more than the caption only the bigger picture I just want to show them to you okay and then you let me know what's going on okay Kevin Hart and his best man oh man that's me and my god it's made my handsome son man my best man reason why my son was my best man is because he's my best friend and I felt that my son should be there for his dad on his big day and before the wedding he actually gave a toast in the back he gave a little quick toast really some juice and his cup and we all had a shot he held it up man it was cool all right so this one squad goals a up in South Africa yeah yeah what is going out here what all do the two lions that I brought when I was in South Africa I paid 16 million dollars for two lions you at all scared I don't think so we're in South Africa we go to the lion what's it called the lion lion part we go to the lion park and they're like oh man we're gonna take you Kevin we're gonna show you the real deal you got the VIP treatment you will take you out there with the Lions and I said ok I don't know what happened I blacked out and these guys made us feel so comfortable but it was by far the stupidest thing I've ever done it has it would have stupid safe at any point in time you got to understand them Lions can have a bad day and we all just lost sight of reality we were in the Lions Den walking with the Lions like that's me really standing in between two lions yeah it was the stupidest thing I've ever done some all-star game high jinks LeBron James what is he doing he's taking your drink he's thirsty uh you know me and Brian have a great relationship I was at the all-star game I'm sitting courtside and I talked a lot of trash and I said something to LeBron and he was like you had too much to drink he took my drink shut you off during the game when he kept me off and he he took the truck down he gave to Drake and then I just looked down drag is sipping my drink and he's like you had enough so this one is High River broke okay it's kind of now we're going up a little bit [Music] Lacey one catching you catching yeah so I can ask you about hanging out with celebrities all day but we don't have all day so I just want to ask you about one and that's Diddy and when I think about guys who are like no sleep and just operating on this brilliant manic energy I think about diggie and I think about Kevin Hart do you feel like you connect on the same wavelength when you guys are together does this refer to you you have a story that can kind of put that in a box for me oh man plus the cool man you know publish the dope guy reason why I said is because he's out that this is getting hot mm-hmm I don't know what's wrong with safety we're in Austin but but there's a [ __ ] going on man you know I don't know how this is gonna come out I'm about to [ __ ] [ __ ] fire this is about to happen man this is hot but let's go easy tha this emotion is the motivational guy he's a motivating guy sorry he's a guy that always wants more he always was to go above and beyond the same thing would hold you know I cried down to this Oprah I can go on and on Tyler Perry about some of the people that I personally look at Steve Harvey that has been mentors that have taken me to the side I've had amazing conversations with me you you look at them in all but in the same sentence and the same voice you let them know I want to get to where you are I'm following your lead of course I'm redirecting and doing things my way but just know that your moves are being watched by a student I'm a student of the game those are people that have played the game very well respect are you ready to move on you know but I'm gonna do it so this one is 100% pain Wow like is nothing weird what [ __ ] I'm not my fabula babe you know I have a question for chocolate drop up Jay got cheek in place take it place bad girl in hip-hop there's all these regional rep right New York's a little bit cocky ur LA you have the gangster rap Houston chopped and spoiled milk but your hometown of Philly is ground zero for battle rappers

why I called the Bob with a vision blew up one of the things that I admire about you most is your ability to always look at the glass as half-full and turn them into a positive so I want to give you a few between a rock and a hard place scenarios and you tell me how you would spin it into a positives that's I'm good getting booed offstage similair struggling [ __ ] huh what we say Dan that ones I want to give you a few between a rock and a hard place scenarios and you tell me how you look at it as glass half-full so I'm good yeah getting booed off stage okay it ain't that bad not that bad all right here's how well my timing my tongue ain't workin out of lost taste this this I'm going numb brother okay here's the thing it's not that bad reason why it's not that bad it's because you learn

YVDJqipoohc,The Daily Show with Trevor Noah,News,Jordan Klepper Sees It All at The Capitol Insurrection | The Daily Social Distancing Show,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVDJqipoohc,,9M views,News,last week we saw one of the darkest days in american history and for better or worse i was there it was a day that began with the president holding a rally outside of the white house to push lies about voter fraud and urge his followers to take action to overturn the election excuse me is this edition happening over here is this edition is it over here we do not consent to be governed nor shall we ever be consented to be governed by an illegal fraudulent election but you elected a guy who also doesn't care much about consent we do not consent will you accept joe biden as president of the united states on the 20th no i will not accept it no i will not so look what i i've educated myself about this okay i don't know all what's in the constitution have you read it it's pretty short constitution of america yeah i've not read the whole thing no you've heard the entire thing yes it's remarkably sure all right i doubt that but it's okay you should read it because you might be committing a seditious act in an hour and a half okay i'm not gonna comment about that if people didn't vote for joe biden though the dominion system voted for joe biden do you think it's possible that hugo chavez uh infiltrated the dominion systems changed the votes orchestrated by joe biden anything's possible do you think it's possible that a president who never pulled above 50 percent lost the election and is sore about it absolutely not that's not possible the one thing you couldn't help but notice was just how many people looked like they were preparing for battle from the tactical vests to the pitchforks this rally fell charged you can tell these people really love america by the number of weapons they brought to hurt other americans looks like we got some proud boy action either that or the cabela's street team what's your flag say come and take it come and take it do you have a weapon no no why not did they take it sorry bro i was worried that we were in trouble but then i saw that we got the tyranny response team here and i feel a lot better thanks for all you do and for those supposedly caught off guard claiming they didn't see this violence coming if you paid attention to any of these rallies all you have to do is open your eyes and ears the message isn't exactly subtle make no mistake we have the guns and we are now in the streets we are gonna clean this place out one way or another you look down there i have one million plus people angry very very angry people can i ask why you're carrying a pitchfork well pitchfork is a it's just an iconic representation of how of what people over time have done in this country it feels more like a weapon to be quite honest it's not it's farm equipment and it's legal in this in this in the city yeah are you farming today it's an ico it's it's a representation we're not asking for violence right now i got to tell you from the movies i've seen the the hordes of people with pitchforks are usually the bad guys how close do you think we are to 1861 but hang on are we close oh yeah you are that's the civil war would you would you rather die on your knees than be free aren't you a little bit freaked out about 600 000 americans die i see you're not wearing masks never mind this thing was a powder keg all it took was someone to light the fuse like these human blow torches let's have trial by combat stand up and fight stand up and hold your representatives accountable we're going to walk down to the capitol because you'll never take back our country with weakness you have to show strength with those orders the crowd of economically anxious insurrectionists advanced on the capitol so we've been following this protest we headed to the capitol and the trump supporters just broke through the gates and they're now heading into the capital right now people are getting waved up towards the capitol take it back i'm hearing people say let's go keep going who are you with the american people the american people are you military i'm not answering that you're not so you're not military no why are you dressed like military i'm not it's just close is that camouflage it is but

statement the election was stolen we want free and fair elections and if we can't have that in this country we don't have anything so what do you plan on doing we're just going to see how it unfolds

ZYPtgjKJFOs,LEMMiNO,Informative,Top 10 Facts - Team Fortress 2,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYPtgjKJFOs,7 years ago,6.1M views,Informative,"The Team Fortress series
began as a QuakeWorld mod in 1996. In 1999 the developers of the mod
were hired by Valve Software to develop a standalone version of the game
called Team Fortress Classic. Because of the popularity of the game
Valve quickly began development on a potential sequel. However, the sequel took
much longer than expected as the developer wasn't really happy
with the look and feel of the game. It went through numerous stages of development and in the beginning it was planned
to be a realistic military shooter compared to the more cartoony look
we're all familiar with today. When it was first shown at E3 in 1999
it was called Team Fortress: Brotherhood of Arms. But after the reveal at E3 the game wasn't officially
mentioned again until seven years later in 2006. During this time, another version of the game
was leaked, named Team Fortress: Invasion. This version had scrapped the
realistic look for a futuristic sci-fi game featuring a war between humans and aliens. It was later revealed that Valve had quietly built three or
four different games before settling on the final design. In 2007, eight years after
the release of the first installment, Team Fortress 2 was released to the public. In a promotional video for the game
called Meet the Spy, there's a fight scene between
the characters The Spy and The Sniper. During the fight The Spy manages to cut The Sniper
on the left side of his cheek. After the release of the video,
The Sniper's in-game player model was updated to add the scar that
The Sniper actually got in the video. The voice lines... ...were added in the Scout update to the game after fans noticed a resemblance between
The Scout and TV pitchman Vince Offer. Offer is best known for being the pitchman
for the ShamWow commercials, and that's exactly
what these lines are referencing. There are so many references and
easter eggs in this game. For example, The Spy knife, Your Eternal Reward,
is a reference to the dagger used by Jafar in Aladdin. The wooden section of the Liberty launcher
has a crack on the right side which is a reference to the famous Liberty Bell. The name of the Dalokohs Bar is actually
the Russian word for chocolate spelled backwards. The bowtie Dr. Whoa is of course
a reference to Doctor Who. The weapons Baby Face's Blaster
and the Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol are references to the famous 1930s criminals George ""Baby Face"" Nelson
and Charles ""Pretty Boy"" Floyd. The hat Familiar Fez is a reference to the character
Mustafa from the movie Austin Powers 2. The Ap-Sap is a reference to Wheatley from Portal 2. One the taunt kills for The Pyro is called Hadouken. This is of course a direct reference to... ""HADOUKEN!"" No, it's... ""HADOUKEN!"" Street Fighter. It's... It's from Street Fighter.
Can I at least finish the sentence before... ""HA- HA- HA- HA-"" ""DOOOOUU- DOOOOUU- DOOOOUUUUKE-"" ""KE- KE- KE- KE- K- K- K- K..."" When the Red-Tape Recorder
is slowed down by about 80% you can hear that it's actually someone
saying ""let's make some noise"". In early development,
the game was planned to feature grenades, and for those of you who played
the first installment might remember that grenades were a strong feature in
Team Fortress Classic. It's later been explained that they
decided not to use them in the end because they were afraid players would rely on them
too heavily, and start spamming them instead. Thus, they were removed from the game entirely. The inside of the Virtual Viewfinder
has a texture with the text ""GAME OVER"". The texture for the HazMat Headcase
has a hidden note in the corner that means ""SPARKWIRE LOVES PRIMROSE FOREVER"". Both of whom are credited for the items creation. The Neon Annihilator's battery has a nod to the
Facepunch forums that reads ""Death to Facepunch"". If a Scout is blown up, there's a one in a hundred chance
that a dove will fly out of his body. This is a reference to the final scene
of the promotional video Meet the Medic. Where Archimedes is revealed
to be stuck inside The Scout's chest. The two teams featured in the game RED and BLU
is actually not named after the colors. The RED team stands for
Reliable Excavation and Demolition and the BLU team stands for
Builders League United. As Team Fortress 2 doesn't have any type of
story or campaign mode to speak of it's not surprising that a lot of players
are unaware of the extensive universe in which the game actually takes place. This universe and its sort of hidden storyline has slowly been revealed trough the use of comics
and promotional videos for the game. The story begins in the early 19th century
with a man named Zepheniah Mann. Along with his wife, he has three sons
named Redmond, Blutarch, and Gray. For those of you who's been paying attention, this is also the main reason why
the teams are named RED and BLU Anyhow, Redmond and Bluetarch
were born perfectly normal. But Gray was born underweight,
so Zepheniah ordered the baby to be smothered. However, before he could do so, Gray was abducted
by an eagle and managed to survive. Yeah, I know, a fucking eagle. Skipping forward a few decades and Zepheniah is now nearing the end of his life, and thus, decides to divide
the land that he owns into two equal parts. One for Redmond and one for Blutarch. Given the nature of the game, it's not so hard
to figure out what happens next. The two brothers, each hire a team of 9 mercenaries
to take over the land of the other, and there you have the basic premise
of the actual game. But, the war between the two brothers continue
and we need to jump forward another few decades, into the mid to late 20th century
where the game actually takes place. By this time the two companies
RED and BLU have been formed, and are now controlled by a woman named Helen,
also know as The Administrator. The brother Gray is still alive and manages
to kill Redmond and Blutarch who was also still alive through the use
of a life extending machine. After Gray successfully
assassinates his two brothers, he starts a war against the corporation
using his robot army. After Gray takes control, the Administrator and her
assistant Miss Pauling goes into hiding, and the mercinaries from both RED and BLU
end up unemployed because of this. And that's the very breif history of the
Team Fortress 2 storyline so far.",7:18

ADb60W8jTsM,Insider News,News,Inside Poland's 'LGBT-Free' Zones | Insider Docs,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADb60W8jTsM,3 months ago,906K views,News,"Narrator: Poland has been dubbed
the worst place to live in the European Union if you are LGBTQ+. In recent years, around 100 local authorities
across the country have signed declarations against
what they call LGBT ideology. In the face of attacks
and hostile hate speech, activists continue to fight back. They march in pride events
around the country and have even managed to pressure some
councils to backtrack on their declarations. Still, much of Poland
remains a virtual no-go area. LGBTQ people in Poland told us
they now feel more alienated and afraid than ever. The situation is getting
only worse and worse. We are basically treated not like human beings. Narrator: In the spring of 2019, the quiet town of Kraśnik
in southeast Poland signed a declaration saying that
being lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer undermines traditional values and Polish family life. Jan Albiniak is an elected
official in Kraśnik who voted in favor of the
declaration against so-called LGBTQ ideology. Narrator: He believes that pride
marches, and even mentioning LGBTQ issues in schools, damages traditional Polish family values. The declarations are not laws, but they send out a clear
message to the local LGBTQ community.
In Kraśnik, Adam Cezary Gąska flies the only rainbow flag we could find. For him, it's a protest against the
town's homophobic stance.
 
But when he put it up in
2020, it soon attracted some unwanted attention. Adam is keeping his flag, as
well as his faith in the future. It has never been easy for
LGBTQ people in Poland, which is staunchly
conservative and Catholic. But support for LGBTQ rights, and the number of pride marches,
has grown steadily over the last 20 years. When the right-wing and
euro-skeptic Law and Justice party came to power
in 2015, the tone changed. First, they framed migrants
as the national threat. But by the 2019 election cycle, they'd switched attention to
demonizing the LGBTQ community as a way of rallying voters
against a perceived threat. Narrator: This is when towns like Kraśnik began signing declarations or
adopting so-called ""family charters."" And in the 2020 presidential runoff, President Andrzej Duda beat the
pro-Europe and pro-LGBT-rights mayor of Warsaw with his hard-line stance. One of his main campaign
messages: Being gay is, quote, ""an ideology worse than communism."" Other religious and political
leaders have likened it to Nazism or a disease. Miłosz: We are called the rainbow plague. We are basically treated
not like human beings, which has even been said, that LGBT is not people -- it's an ideology. Narrator: Also in 2020, 200,000
people signed a petition calling for a ban on all pride marches and
delivered it to parliament. And in June 2021, the education minister called
an equality parade through Warsaw and insult to public morality, the latest official outcry
in one of the most religious countries on the continent. Many fear that the language
employed by local councils and central government could be a
precursor for a clampdown on rights -- and even physical violence. While much of Europe is seeing the rise of
progressive, inclusive policies around same-sex
marriage and adoption, in Poland both are outlawed. And with the help of the
right-wing, state-owned media, the notion that being gay
or trans is an ideology is gaining traction. In Polish we say that if you
throw enough mud on somebody, some of it will stick. You would expect that
reasonable people would say, ""Well, that's bulls---."" But if you hear this bulls---
all the time, you know, the repeated message all the
time saying the same things or the same awful things, some of this will stay in people's heads. Narrator: About 25 kilometers
south of Kraśnik is the district of Niedrzwica Duza. The town council here signed
a declaration a couple of days before Kraśnik did, in May 2019. Kazimierz
Strzelec was stunned. Narrator: Kazimierz has been a
devout Catholic all his life. He's also a gay-rights activist
and organizes pride events every year. He says since the polarizing political
hate campaigns of the last few years, things have got worse, and
now even feels rejected by members of his own church. In 2019, he helped organize the second-ever
pride march in the nearby city of Lublin. At the march, police arrested a couple
carrying a homemade bomb. Narrator: Equality marches, as they're known in Poland,
were banned as recently as 2007. They have become more widespread,
with an estimated 25 held across the country in 2019. But they still face
considerable opposition. Kazimierz has particularly
strong memories of the first ever march in the northeastern
city of Bialystok, which descended into violence in July 2019. Narrator: But the fight back is underway. After towns began signing their declarations in 2019, a group of activists started
a campaign of naming and shaming. An online map called the
Atlas of Hate pinpoints every place that has signed
declarations or so-called family charters, which both claim to want
to halt the spread of LGBT ideology. The map inspired Polish
gay-rights activist Bart Staszewski to then put
up signs at the entrance to each town declaring them ""LGBT-free."" Bart: So I created a sign, the ""LGBT-free zone"" sign that I bring with me to the cities that declare as LGBT-free. I put it there. I invite people who are brave enough to join my project from those cities, the LGBT people, to make a
testimonial of how they feel being excluded from the local community. Narrator: And he worries about the future. Bart: The young people are
afraid of coming out because the atmosphere is simply homophobic. Those poor kids that
are committing suicide because of the homophobia
in Poland, because they are just afraid
of coming out, because there are families, parents throw them out from the
homes because they heard on TV that they are kind of demons, and
they are perverts, or whatever. Narrator: Both the map and Bart's guerrilla tactics
got international media attention, and the declarations
drew a scathing response from the EU. So I want to be crystal clear: LGBTQI-free zones are humanity-free zones, and they have no place in our union. Narrator: Those behind the map
were nominated for a prestigious human-rights award from
the European Union. Towns highlighted began to pay the price
for their homophobia, losing access to European funds. Kraśnik lost millions in grant
money from Norway, and was dropped by its twin city in
France. Then, in April 2021, Kraśnik backed down and
repealed its declaration. In the months that followed,
other towns followed suit. But large swathes of
the map are still red. And a group of local governments
are suing the activists behind the Atlas of Hate for slander. In many countries, younger generations tend
to be more progressive. But in Poland, these deeply entrenched beliefs
are held by old and young alike. The All-Polish Youth is a far-right
nationalist movement here ... Narrator: Miłosz Przepiórkowski
runs a charity offering counseling and support for Poland's LGBTQ community. Miłosz: We can only see how
devastated they are by the fact that they are not accepted for who they are. So this is very tragic,
especially for young people. Narrator: He surveyed 10,000 young
LGBTQ people across the country in 2016 together with a
consortium of organizations. They found that 70% had suicidal
thoughts or were depressed compared to less than half
of American LGBTQ+ youth. And almost 70% of LGBTQ people
of all ages in Poland had been the focus of homophobic abuse. Miłosz: I think it's very important
to show them that they have a place where they can get real
support. That there are people who are like them. There are people who can help them. It is a human right to feel protected in their own state,
to have this dignity and having the right to marry whenever, who they like. It's not hurting anybody, and they
need to state that this is true. We are not hurting anybody. We just demand equality,
not the privilege. Narrator: When Kasik considers
his struggle for equality in Poland, he takes an optimistic view,
and an inspirational quote:",12:53
oAADFdfa-G4,Eater,Food,How Two Master Chefs Run the Only Michelin-Starred Korean Steakhouse — Mise En Place,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAADFdfa-G4,5 months ago,6.1M views,Food,"- All right, let's get started. This marinated short
rib is the last portion of our Butcher's Feast and Omakase, and we call it the ""meat dessert"" kind of. It's sweet, crispy.
(upbeat dance music) - We go through a shit ton of meat. I believe we go through about
3,000 pounds of beef per week. - People might think that
we work at a steakhouse so that we could be sick and
tired of meat, but we're not. Cutting this, marinating
this, eating this, it's so much fun. - But a lot of time, too,
a lot of time and effort. What we're gonna do, just
push both of them together, and you're just gonna work your way down. - Short rib is considered
not a super high-end cut, but the reason why the
short rib is so expensive is because it needs a lot of knife work. - Unlike conventional steakhouses, we need to create a lot
of fermentation process, which is meticulous, you
need to clean it really well, you need time to age it, it
means a shit ton of work. - There's a nice feeling about taking this clean off like this. I mean, I guess if you
do this long enough, you just kind of get into the groove, and something just feels
like, oh, that's a nice cut, that's a clean cut. So this is clean. From here, we're just
gonna take this down. Once you cut this in half,
you'll really see the marble. - People think that,
hey, you cook every meat on the table, little do they know. It's definitely a very
labor-intensive operation. - Final butchering stage of the short rib, it's gonna be scoring on
the diagonal, like so, making sure that we're not
cutting all the way through, and then we're gonna flip it around, do the similar thing, gonna
cut all the way through, and if you do it correctly,
once you pull it out, it should kind of do a little stretch. Short ribs usually are
prepared as a braised item, longer cooking techniques,
but if you do this with a correct marinade,
you can cook this under four or five minutes, and
it'll still be very juicy, tender, a lot of flavors, and it kind of stretches
like an accordion. So for me, this volume from the get go was just a normal day, a mountain
of short ribs, for sure. - As a chef, having really
great product is something that's not granted, it
just makes me really proud. - When you look at a swan
gliding through the pond, they look so graceful. Underneath they're paddling like hell, and I think that's what our operation is. - So after this, we're gonna
put it into our kalbi marinade that's made in-house with all
of our lovely fruit juices, and it sits in the marinade about minimum of six to eight hours before it's served. - [SK] All the food that we do over here, there's nothing that
we can make on the fly. If we don't pay attention
from the beginning, then the result is wrong, then we can't really
fast forward anything. - So after the short rib, we
probably have another six, eight more cuts to cut. It's a morning of butchery today. - A lot of times when you look at Cote, it's ""get lit and have a lot of fun,"" but you cannot achieve that
without genuinely putting in the time, the muscle,
the sweat, and the tears. - Yeah, so right now,
these guys are preparing for dinner service. The sink on the right is
our scallion salad mix, which goes to every table. The julienne, or cut the scallion
with our scallion machine, and you cut scallion like this
by knife will take us days. A week where it broke and we had to, there was six of us with knives, just trying to julienne this for hours. - That happened to me when
I first joined the team. It was a Friday night, Saturday night. I don't want to go back. (laughs) - And, you guys, you just gotta
see how dense this thing is. I can't even pick this up. These guys are probably
going through four, six cases of scallion,
five, six cases of lettuce, and this is on the daily prep so we can feed our guests
a lot of vegetables. - Cote is a steakhouse, but we
are also a Korean steakhouse. I'm from Korea, so are both of our chefs. So it was a very important mission for us to bring forward
authentic flavors of Korea. - So this is the first
process of making the kimchi. So we take the outer leaves
that are a little bit wilted. - And what we didn't
want to be is this kind of a westernized, Americanized
version of Korean flavors. - And usually the stem is the part that gets salted the least,
so we just crack it open so there's more area for
the salt to penetrate. Salting is the most important part. If you mess up on the salting, the cabbage won't eat
the marinade so well, and instead of being crunchy, it's gonna get a little bit mushy, and that's when you kind of fail. - [SK] So this process,
there's no cheating, there's no fast forward for this one. Literally every single
leaf has to be salted. - [David] If you cheat, you waste- - [SK] There's no going back. - [David] 10 to 14 days
worth of your time. - Right, so this is called Topanyeom, which is a 1,000 day aged salt, which is typically super coarse. In Korean, there's a term
now that says ""son-mat,"" which is your taste of your hand. It's a key aspect of Korean cuisine 'cause a lot of the recipe
says, ""taste of the hand."" - And usually when we do kimchi in Korea, usually three moms are together, and they get piles of cabbage. - [David] Aunties, your
whole family, yeah. - Yeah, aunties, and
then it's like a huge, huge, huge kimchi production
going on over there. - My parents and my
family know that I work at a Korean steakhouse, Korean restaurant. But when I tell them I'm making six cases of kimchi a week, they'll be like, ""What are you doing making kimchi? Oh, you went to culinary
school to make kimchi? I could have taught you that."" So after this video goes out, we might get a lot of calls from family. - My background, after
school, is from Jean Georges, basically both of us were coming from a French-based restaurant. I never thought that I was
gonna cook Korean food, but- - [David] Here he is. - Here I am, and then I really like it because when I came here, I was like, oh, this feels like home
because I know kimchi, I know kalbi. - After a certain point,
you kind of look at yourself or think back, it's like, what now? The more and more you think about it and what holds you to your past, I think really starts to bloom, and I think that's why we're here. - But now it's like on a restaurant scale. So it's a little bit
stressful, but it's fun because we always try
to perfect everything. So these guys are gonna
sit for about 12 hours, and it'll be ready to be
stuffed with our marinade. All right, so you want to make sure that there's a crunch,
otherwise when you ferment, it's not gonna have the texture
that you're looking for. Mm, salty, crunchy.
(group laughs) Everybody can scoop to their hotel pans, and we're gonna stuff
it, just like the salt, making sure that we get
in between each leaves. So once you stuff it nicely, I'm gonna put it into this bucket, have this closed off,
fermented in the walk-in for about 10 to 14 days. Two, four, six, eight, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 30 buckets of kimchi at a time that's being stored in the walk-in. It's our secret sauce, right? - Sourcing to us is probably one of the most important things. So right now we have two
kinds of caviar on our menu. We're actually looking to
expand our caviar program. Owning a restaurant, we get to taste a lot of different things, but
tasting caviar never gets old. This is definitely one
of the greater perks. - So I brought in six different kinds. - We want to bring really,
really difficult-to-find caviar. Having a great relationship
with your vendors really helps. And ideally, I'm looking for
something that's actually gray, with almost like a white hue
to it, like grayish white. - [Shaoching] Oh, I see. - But our restaurant is a
little darker and moodier, that kind of lighter pop kind of brings that kind of excitement to the table. This is the hybrid that we
already currently serve. Oh, man, that's so delicious. There's a reason why we use this, huh? - [Shaoching] And I have brought in today white sturgeon from California. and I also brought in another species that's a Siberian from Uruguay. - If you're gonna taste it, taste a lot, right, so you can actually
taste the whole thing, right? - All the big chefs do that. The next one, you should try the supreme. Supreme, yeah, it's white
sturgeon, and it's very aged. - That very pleasant salt, it's not that kind of bitter salty. - The next shipment, I'm
gonna send you something. I have to really pick... when
I open 10 tins, maybe one. - I want big pearl,
different flavor profile, kind of gray with the whiter hue, if you could create that. (laughs) - Okay, I can create that, I'm
gonna start raising new fish. - Shaoching, thank you
very much for coming. It's always a pleasure.
- Oh, it's a pleasure. - So all the trays that
you see they're building, this is a big part of
the morning production, and our opening runners and the prep team, they really get into this
banchan program hard. This is for every table
that's gonna be dining with us tonight, kimchi to
pickles to sesame leaves. We're gonna work on the raw bar. I think SK prepared some
awesome seafood, and- - Super excited, what you got? - Live king crab, live spotted prawns, and live razor clams. - [Simon] I'm excited, bro. - [David] Cool. - [SK] Let's do this. - Last year we introduced
our seafood platter. We call it the Grand Plateau. - And we got this amazing
king crab, all live. - [David] Damn. - [SK] Look at that. - It's missing that je ne sais quoi, so we're actually trying
to see what we can add to add that final shine
on that diamond ring. - So we're gonna do a
ceviche form of razor clams, spotted prawns, all live.
- Spotted prawns. - [SK] Yeah, so sweet, so
we're just gonna serve it raw. - So Chef SK and Chef David,
they're the culinary powerhouse behind this operation. Normally a steakhouse is
not necessarily a concept that requires very powerful chefs, whereas Cote, that's
where it all comes from. - Butchering all day and then into getting these
gastronomical techniques, how to poach, how to cook, how
to saute, or how to blanche, this is when our chef mentality
really comes together. We're like, zoom, how do I make this the
most awesome king crab that we can make? - Cote, we want to position
ourselves somewhere in between a steakhouse where everything's just a funnel through, and there's a super chef-driven
creative restaurant. I think somewhere in
between lies a perfect spot. - [SK] All right, and
we're gonna let this sit. All right, first here is the oysters. - I feel like Simon Kim is a medium. I try to kind of stay in
between what a customer wants and what chefs want to do. Initially, the tension between the chef and my vision has been kind
of difficult in the beginning, but at this point, we've
been open for four years. We've really worked just like one being. - Dealing with Simon's a
little... I'm just gonna say it, a pain in the butt. He wants to be the best version of it. - But he's always a great supporter. Yes, he pushes, but we all know that, where he's coming from, we
only want to get better. - Working in the kitchen, you
kind of lose the mentality of what the guests want
'cause you're always focused about, what do I want to
do, what do we want to do. We really want to respect
the guests' perspective, and Simon brings definitely
a big portion of that. So I think this iteration, we're gonna try to meet all of his
requirements to bring the best of what they have in the market currently. (gently chiming music) We love caviar here. I think we've definitely
made a different iteration of the ones that we've had in the past. Decided to put the caviar on the top to give that super luxe feeling. I mean, we'll probably
sit down with Simon, he'll give us shit a little bit, and we'll figure it out. - Basically, he's gonna be
like, ""Okay, that looks good, but now we're gonna talk
about the food costs,"" doesn't make sense.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - And we're gonna need to
charge about $250 for one, and then he'll be like, ""No, I think that's a little too crazy."" And then we'll be like,
""Okay, these are the ones that you like and that we did it, and then what can we do?"" - What's going on, chefs? - What's going on, Simon?
- All right, so. - Ooh, it looks really nice.
- We did a little bit of a different version of our tower. And the middle tier is
where it really went luxe. - It's really beautiful. I think the razor clam's
gonna be very difficult to eat, unless you're very
crafty with your chopstick, I think it's gonna be a little difficult. Maybe we get individualized
things per person so that everyone gets one,
and then they can do that because if I'm with four of my friends, if I make a mess, I'm
gonna be embarrassed. What is this, spotted prawn? - Yeah. - [Simon] That was live, no? - Yeah, yeah. Only the best. - So sweet, yeah. The spotted prawn looks really good. I don't know, caviar on top, it definitely looks like a
crown jewel, for sure, right? But in terms of elevation wise, right, being in such a top position, it's gonna be a little difficult, right, 'cause imagine, I'm assuming
that elevation wise, it's gonna be not that
easy to put together. Otherwise the customer has to go through, do this, and that's not
that fun either, right? So I think we need to figure out something that's a little easier
to take from the top. But otherwise, I love the king crab. I think it's gonna taste super delicious. Live, live, huh? - Yeah, all live. - That's awesome, wow, that's amazing. Yeah, king crab, it's
definitely... I mean, in terms of costing, do you think, what do you think this is gonna be? - I think it's gonna be pretty pricey. (group laughs)
(overlapping chattering) King crab only has six legs. (laughs) - [David] And there's two of them. - Yeah. - I think we're definitely onto something, but I think we need to figure out, A, we don't want to make it too expensive. I think the entire Grand
Plateau should be less than $225 for sure, right? I think caviar can be
just an add-on, right, so if somebody wants it,
caviar should be, right, because this thing is gonna
be $120 right here, right? - Right, it is, yeah. - Yeah, but it looks
good, let's get moving. - All right. - Thank you, Chef. - [David] We got beef coming in. - At a steakhouse, everything
starts and ends with beef. Beef is king. - We got American Wagyu flat iron. - And of course, trimming
is a huge part of it 'cause we receive everything, and we need to now take out the silver skin, and then make it just really presentable. - Oh, look, more short ribs. This arrival comes in almost every day, maybe twice a day, if
we're running before. - It all depends. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - And I don't know what
they're doing with it all, but what they with not only the rib meat, but with the short ribs,
with the chuck flat, with the flat iron,
stuff that's really not typically considered like a prime cut or a premium cut, it's unbelievable. - [SK] What we have here
is imperial Wagyu flatiron, which goes on our Butcher's Feast. - So Butcher's Feast is the foolproof way of enjoying Korean steakhouse. - We just gotta say this
flatiron probably is most, one of the most underrated
cuts of the cow. So the reason a lot of
people are turned off by this cut is because of this. So inside there's this thick membrane, or we call it the sinew. So this part, it's hardly noticeable. It kind of blends in with the beef. We're just gonna go
straight down the middle and take off the hard sinew,
the chewy part of this beef, and you'll be able to
grill this and slice, and it'll be a very tender
steak, and that's it. Next, ribeye? - So we have our own dry aging room, number one, because it's a swag. - So this is our dry aging room. I'm gonna be taking out a couple of the ones that are ready. We age them about 45 days minimum, and we'll cut it, portion it, and we'll be ready for service tonight. - It's so important that
we receive the best beef, and that beef never leaves our sight. - [SK] The meat is dry
aged, so when you cut, it's a little... you just
gotta be more mindful, if you follow the lines. - We're in full control of our aging room. It's important that we are in control of every aspect of our steak. - And show you the way. See, it's simple. We're just gonna go straight to the saw, and then we're gonna cut it into about inch and a half thick cuts. Not a lot of restaurants have a band saw because of it's dangerous, space, whatnot, but we figured this is
gonna be a key component into our operation.
(slow electronic music) And all of these are good to go. And what Victor's gonna do is he's gonna scrape off this fat,
and he'll clean it up nice. The next step after this is
we use this part of the fat on the grill, so when we butcher, normally we would take this part. Next, we'll take this off the bone. So this will be used
for the Butcher's Feast, and the cap, or the spinalis,
will be used for the omakase. All right, we have the last part of... oh. We have the last part
of our Butcher's Feast, which is the hanger steak. - Back in the day, when you go to a Korean barbecue restaurant, you needed to go with a Korean friend. - If I have to pick one cut
that I hate to cut the most, it's probably the hanger steak, (laughs) 'cause it never comes in
the same size, same shape. So this sits close to the organs, so it's definitely been more iron rich. I feel like this represents
the best translations to what beef is supposed to
taste like, in my opinion. So it always has two sides,
a larger muscle on one, a thinner muscle on the other. - So we wanted to demystify it, right? You can walk in and
order a Butcher's Feast, and you'll get everything that
authentic Korean guy ordered at a Korean barbecue restaurant. - And one side is clean. Many houses, if you were
to cook this in-house, I think it's okay to leave
a little bit of the gray on, but since we're gonna
present it raw to the table, just want to go down the middle, follow this line that's
never a straight line, but more a slanted horizontal line. Skin the silver skin. We like to wrap the beef. I think it definitely absorbs the blood, which prevents it from
oxidizing, but at the same time, I think it dries the
beef a little bit more, which gives it a nicer crust. So this is gonna be our
Butcher's Feast, four for four. So what we want to do is make sure that it is thick enough
so that they can grill. Here's the hanger steak. Next, the ribeye. - So Cote is kind of perceived
as a fancy restaurant 'cause it is, we have the
best beef that money can by. - [SK] Flat iron. - But if you came here and
only ate Butcher's Feast, it can be in and out at $58 per person. - [SK] And then the marinated short rib, so that'll be the feast set. - This smokeless grill
that's in the center of every single table is center of Cote. It's the most important piece. A steak is like a brand new Mercedes Benz. The moment it leaves the
lot, which is a charbroiler, it depreciates in value. So what we did is we
brought the power plant, which is a charbroiler, out to the table. If you're gonna ball
out, our Steak Omakase, it's about seven different cuts. - And we're gonna go from
a very lean cut, the filet, next cut will be the skirt steak. There's the ribeye cap. - And you get to eat all different beef, but very small portion. It's about lighting your palette, as opposed to consuming
a large amount of beef. - And then the Cote steak,
American chopped flat tail. So that's the Omakase for four. This would also be finished
with our marinated short rib. (gently chiming music) We got through most of our butchering. I think Victor's got a
few more things to do. Most of our runner teams
are starting to show up, getting ready for service. - We have a lot of regular customers that we're very grateful to continuously. They patronize us, so we
want to bring something new. - [David] Next thing we
have is Kobe A5 beef. - We want to bring really,
really difficult-to-find beef. - I never got a chance to
ever cut this, in poor taste. - One of the most expensive
cut in the earth, so yeah. - $300 per pound, all right? Uh-oh, moment of truth.
(slow orchestral music) Whoa, so we have the Miyazaki that we serve currently at
Cote, and this is a Kobe ribeye. So that it doesn't flare, I'm gonna trim this fat a little bit. Shall we, excuse me. All right, so we got our
charcoal grills ready. Only thing we're gonna do
is a little bit of salt. - So all of these things
that people have heard of it, we want to be the one that
actually tastes it and vet it. - [David] You know what,
I'm gonna pull this as is. - And make sure that we bring value and quality to our customers. - [David] I'm kind of nervous to cut it, but you know what, let's try it out. - And 99.9% of Kobe in
America are not really Kobe. This is actually born and
raised and slaughtered in Kobe. This is my third time
eating Kobe beef, so. - Third time, wow, lucky you.
- First time. First time for us. - [Simon] All right, let's do it. I'm gonna do actually Kobe first, yeah. - [SK] Okay. - [David] Okay. - Exploded and disappeared. - But that is really light, right, it's not as-
- Super. - It's very different, yeah.
- It's not as heavy. It's funny. - I mean, if you even
see the cutting board, and all the fat that came
from the Miyazaki compared to the Kobe, it's completely different. This just eats so much smoother, or- - It does, it doesn't
really feel that much strong on the fat right now. - [Simon] How much more expensive is this? - [David] Double. - It's double, okay. The question is, is it
worth it, double the price? (David laughs) - I'm not 100% sure yet. - I think what we should do
is we can just feature it, let's special it, and see how
our customers react to it, and then see how that goes. Very excited about this. So it is 4:30, chefs are
putting final touches on his mise en place. In 30 minutes, guests are
gonna be lining out the door. So we're gonna get busy, thank you. (group applauds) - [Amy] Simon, you want
to send us into service? - [Simon] Yes, we actually
have a really exciting thing that's not on the menu right now. We actually got some Kobe beef. I believe it's going to be $64 an ounce. To send you off, a lot
of new stuff here, right? It's a good amount,
right, so there's a lot of information to learn, right,
but at the end of the day, hospitality is about
making our guests happy. The hospitality of pleasing
people doesn't start at five o'clock, but it starts now, right? We please each other, we create a culture where we are constantly in habit
of making each other happy, and when the five o'clock
comes, customer comes in, it's natural for us to
make them happy, all right? So much love, thank you. (group applauds)
(overlapping chattering) - It's about five o'clock,
sort of quick line check. We have our egg souffle,
soybean stew, kimchi stew. We want to make sure everything
that is our mise en place, which is the things that we
need for service, is correct. (dramatic orchestral music) We might have to season the
kimchi stew a little bit, and we got a big, fresh push ahead of us, so let's get ready. First push, okay, we're
gonna take three shrimp, five oysters, table
62, fire steak tartare. - [Chef] They want this out. - [David] Bacon and
steak tartare, table 65. Can I have the two oysters
for Omakase, please? Service. Can we take oysters, table 32? Two steak and eggs, table 22. - For me, dining experience
is about having fun. Of course, there's the nourishment and the ingredient has to be great and the technique has to be great, but I want to bring real joy. When our customers come in,
and that little dry-aged fat, we kind of purposefully
leave it on the thing for a little longer so it kind of renders, and we go, boom, and
the flame just goes up. People go, ""Wow,"" and as a restaurateur, those kind of small moments of where we wow our
customer is so important. - Followed by, can I have one,
(upbeat jazzy music) two, three, four scallions, please? 15 should have left, go, go, go. (overlapping chattering) Now the hotline's gonna get busy with all the stews coming in. Fire two stews. 23 out, 33 out, next table, 64. Oh, damn, SK? Four ounces of Kobe on the board. Can you, guys, next,
we're gonna go table 31 with the four ounces of
Kobe, table 22 and table 34. Next, 61, Pedro, if we can go 61. - So I'm from Korea, I became an American, and I have a love for
both of those cultures, that's who I am, it makes me Simon Kim, it's Korean and American. (speaking Spanish) I
need two more kimchis! So it's ultimately a steak dinner, but there's a lot of elements
that's hidden in there. The customer doesn't
feel like they're going to a Korean restaurant
when they come to Cote, but ultimately, they're
enjoying Korean flavors and way of eating. That approach is something that I really appreciate about Cote. - We're done with the first push. As soon as we send out the
last two stews, we're done. What's going on? - How's it going down here? Pretty rocking upstairs. - Yeah, I mean, first one was pretty hard. - You ready for the next round? - Yeah, of course.
(overlapping chattering) Thank you, always a pleasure.
(overlapping chattering) Always a pleasure.
- Thank you, thank you. - [Simon] Thank you. - Thank you.
- Yeah, thank you. When our customers leave Cote, I want them to feel like
they had the best time of their lives and they
ate the best freaking steak that they have ever ate,
and I think that's it. It's simple, they had
the best freaking time and they ate the best
steak in their lifetime, and let's do it again. (upbeat jazzy music continues)

3TitHNx0l3w,Insider News,News,How Apples Are Made In A Lab,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TitHNx0l3w,,3.1M views,News,[Music] this is how most new kinds of apples are born these days far from an orchard in a lab scientists at washington state university have been on a quest to breed the perfect apple for more than 20 years and they think they finally got it the cosmic crisp hit the market on december 1st 2019. it was the largest launch of an apple in american history coming after a half a billion dollars in investment 10 million dollars in marketing in two decades of breeding and testing we take a look at what it took to engineer what's been called the perfect apple and why some hope it'll save the washington state apple industry in the late 90s washington state's apple industry was on the brink of collapse that's because more than a hundred thousand acres of trees grown were foreign apple that was losing its popularity the red delicious once a star of the supermarket the apple is now criticized for its bland taste and mealy texture by the end of the decade farmers lost about 760 million dollars in three years that's when bruce barrett stepped in i did that for every day and began breeding what would become the cosmic crisp the goal was to have a fruit that was just as beautiful as the red delicious but also had a sweet taste and a nice crunch we had all our eggs are in one basket red delicious that's not good economics it's just not good if we grow more and more of something that people like less and less that's not a good business model either since then growers have increased production of other varieties but the red delicious still counts for almost a third of apple tree acreage in the state today to successfully take its place the cosmic crisps need it to last at least 12 months about six months longer than the red delicious that's because the apple industry super bowl is the fall season when farmers harvest nearly all the apples consumed through the rest of the year so the goal is to find an apple that tastes as good in march as it does in october which is why barrett chose the honey crisp and the enterprise as the cosmic crisps parents for their crispness and storage qualities respectively but even then it took thousands of trials and errors take a bite soft terrible ten thousand seeds and those seeds grew into trees and we looked through 10 000 of them and a couple showed promise and the one that showed the most promise was causing a crisp in the first few years of breeding the cosmic crisp seeds grew into seedlings by year four the seedlings turned into trees and produced their first apple fruits and by 2008 though the cosmic crisps didn't even have a name it had promising characteristics the selection that is now named cosmic crisp was one of i think 10 selections so that meant that they were just moving into a point where we would get bulk volumes of fruit that would enable us to do some of that really in-depth evaluation of the fruit in the next 11 years that in-depth evaluation consisted of tons of tests evaluating the cosmic crisp size shape color crunchiness juiciness and tartness the wsu team tests the ripeness of the apple using iodine to determine the best time to harvest what it does is that iodine then it binds to the starch that's in the fruit as the fruit ripens that starch turns to sugar and so when you've stained it with iodine and it's fully purple or black that's that's showing that it's it's really immature it's very starchy the lighter the flesh the sweeter the apple [Music] see that juice a juice inside makes it makes it a pleasant thing to eat i can eat this all day there you go that's how you know but with hundreds of consumer favorites already on the market how can a new apple stand a chance it takes a big budget takes a big industry and it takes a big product all those things have to come together the cosmic crisp has it all named for its galactic-looking skin experts expect the apple to take over the industry by the end of 2019 washington farmers had grown 12 000 acres of cosmic crisp trees which falls in the middle of apple production for the state and to catch up with its competitors 10.5 million dollars went into just marketing the apple it even has its own commercial the variety will only be available to state-based growers for the first 10 years the growers they deserve that advantage they contributed to the research project and so they have a 10-year head start the cosmic crisp sells for about three to five dollars a pound as a premium apple variety which is more than twice the price of standard varieties like the gala still the apples creators are confident the cosmic crisp is up for the challenge we want people to really enjoy apples and we felt to have that happen we had to give them better apples we had to rise above golden delicious red delicious macintosh we had to have an apple that was a much better eating experience and more than two decades later it worked in september of 2020 the cosmic crisp won the good housekeeping institute's healthy snack of the year [Music] award [Music] you,6:03
XfcvX0P1b5g,Barely Sociable,Informative,Bitcoin - Unmasking Satoshi Nakamoto,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfcvX0P1b5g,,1.1M views,Informative,"[Music] well they're only two of the accused the British one of those has two spaces in every one of his papers favorite out people in the take you 15 minutes [Music] as you all know it's been a while since I've talked about mr. Satoshi Nakamoto and in all honesty this topic has been something I've put on the back burner until I can actually figure it out now I know you all are incredibly anxious to watch this video but if you haven't watched part 1 or 2 you should know that this video is building off 55 minutes of context so I will link those together in a playlist for you now more we dive into the final chapter of this internet mystery I really need to provide a disclaimer as a lot of people bring up the ethics of naming Satoshi Nakamoto for those people that are concerned that Satoshi is just trying to live his life away from the Bitcoin project that doesn't appear to be the case furthermore I wouldn't say it's unethical to call out someone who is already a public figure especially when there's enough evidence to suffice it unlike Newsweek I'm not throwing someone out into the public eye who isn't used to it if Satoshi is still around then you definitely deserve the right to know the dust has long settled for crypto currencies and a wall I can understand Satoshi wanting to hide early on that argument really isn't true today I really doubt anything will actually happen as a result of me making this video and despite the fact that I can line up a hundred different pieces of circumstantial evidence he still has plausible deniability and just here where I'm not the first person to settle on this individual candidate but while many people have speculated this person to be behind the creation of Bitcoin I plan on going into much more detail here today as I've had time to take the baton and run with it I'm certain many people in the cryptocurrency space know who Satoshi Nakamoto is and surprisingly even John McAfee is one of those people on that list yes I'm well aware that 99 percent of what this guy has to say is exaggerated [ __ ] but even a broken clock is Right twice a day if the secret is already out then the secret is already out so it's about time that someone actually builds a case for the most likely candidate it seems like every month another person is popping up to claim that there's Satoshi Nakamoto and frankly I'd rather tell everyone who Satoshi is and have to deal with a never-ending battle of Satoshi imposters so with all that being said let's finally dive in to the final chapter and final clue that Satoshi Nakamoto left us [Music] in the last part and we discussed Satoshi's message to the p2p foundation forums this was a day after newsweek thrust california resident Dorian satoshi nakamoto into the public eye last time we cover this topic I pointed out how this message was never debunked and was likely from Satoshi we ultimately came to that conclusion because despite the fact that Satoshi's p2p foundation forum account was hacked we managed to find the day that the hacker recovered at this forum account the recovery date showed a six-month discrepancy also at the end of the last video I hinted at this message of being satoshis final mark on the internet but there is actually one other message that exists from what a satoshis accounts that has also never been debunked this message it was sent at the peak of the Bitcoin scaling drama and this message also comes from satoshis of visto mail email now if you recall Satoshi NAT gmx comm was the email that was hacked but Satoshi had another email address and this email was almost exclusively used on the cryptography mailing list understanding the context of this message and what happened in 2015 is crucial in understanding why Satoshi hasn't revealed his identity so please bear with me as we get into some of the technical aspects all of this begins with the very first response to satoshis a Bitcoin a white paper on the cryptography mailing list the very first message came from a person by the name of James a Donald and he said we very very much need such a system but the way I understand your proposal it does not seem to scale to the required size fast forward to 2020 and this individual problem regarding Bitcoin scaling it still remains if you've ever tried to send money with Bitcoin and you probably know the transaction process is far from instant the reason this is the case is due to the fact that every time a Bitcoin transaction has to take place it has to be verified inside blocks by the Bitcoin miners think of each block as a page in a book a new block is added to the blockchain roughly every 10 minutes or so one of the bottlenecks this yelling is that each transaction takes up a bit of space currently there's a size limit that is set to one megabyte per block which means the Bitcoin network can process around seven transactions per second as more people start to use Bitcoin more transactions need to be verified and since miners can only verify a certain amount at a time the network hits a maximum capacity which causes slowed transactions and higher transaction fees no Satoshi added this one megabyte block limit in secret in 2010 and the reason he did this was to prevent something called a Poisson block attack essentially if there was no block size limit a miner could create a gigantic block let's say the size of a terabyte this would force all the other miners to download a massive file effectively causing a denial of service attack now this caused a divide in the community in 2015 as Satoshi had given instructions before he left that stated that the block size limit would increase in something called a hard fork a hard Fork is an update in which changes are so significant that it effectively creates a separate currency if Bitcoin was going to accommodate more people then this issue needed to be addressed and that brings us to 2015 [Music] 2015 is a year that Bitcoin and saw a civil war Gavin Henderson the man who Satoshi had put in charge and another developer by the name of Mike Hearn took it upon themselves to provide a solution for the Bitcoin ceiling dilemma in June of 2015 Gavin proposed Bitcoin improvement protocol 101 this proposal sought to increase the block size to 8 megabytes in double every two years if the miners were able to reach a 75% consensus and upgrade their software if this fork was to succeed then Bitcoin XT would actually overtake Bitcoin as the main currency many people agreed that this block size limit needed to be raised at some point in time but the hard part here is getting everyone to agree on one proposal Gavin's proposal was quite popular and while it wasn't perfect many people saw it as a way to deal with the oncoming influx of new individuals to the network however many of the other developers were not on board with this decision particularly one for-profit company involved in bitcoins development what you need to understand here is that Gavin expanded bitcoins team from 2011 to 2014 and throughout this entire time and Gavin in the Bitcoin foundation were playing the regulatory game the Bitcoin foundation to which Gavin was a founder was created to improve bitcoins reputation after the Silk Road gave it its criminal background the Bitcoin foundation was the one hit with threats for running an unlicensed money business and the Bitcoin foundation was the one who testified against lawmakers successfully Satoshi ran away at the first mention of the government while Gavin's foundation played it correctly and lobbied for the right regulation waa Satoshi Nakamoto invented Bitcoin Gavin's stewardship made it successful but after all this in April of 2014 Gavin would step down as the lead developer to focus on promotion six months after Gavin wood stepped down block stream was founded a for-profit company among a group of top developers essentially their proposal would encourage transactions to be done off chain where a block stream could pocket the fees instead of the miners you can find a wide variety of opinions on block stream online but I think it's naive to think that venture capital be injected into the development of Bitcoin wouldn't change the goals a little bit so it's block streams goal to generate profit or to increase the value of Bitcoin so we actually have green address also the consume our wallet really but mobile wallet but yeah Laurie right now all of our stuff is free we're mainly focused on R&D we have been very focused on R&D we'll have liquid coming out early next year hopefully fingers crossed and that will be a commercial service that will generate revenue but the the goal is everything will generate revenue it's not this we're gonna build stuff for free forever now getting back to Bitcoin XT in 2015 if Gavin was successful in getting 75% of the miners to come with him there would be no point in developing side chains and block streams investors would probably be pretty upset this was a coup because not only would this force blocks to get larger it would also give developmental control back to Gavin and Mike Hearn as Mike was the only one with commit access to Bitcoin XT now I want you to pay attention to the following statement and given from block stream CEO when he was asked if the blockchain Forks and Bitcoin XT prevails is the dominant chain then that also establishes a new core team of developers with Mike Hearn and Gavin Anderson in sole custody of the source code how would this changed the long term governance of Bitcoin Adam back responded Gavin naively thinks he'll do a coup force the issue and then invite people to participate in the coup however Mike states in the Bitcoin XT website that he is the final decision-maker so it's clearly intended to change the decision-making process and mike has not been without bias and controversy it seems quite unlikely from indications I see that any of the core people who maintain Bitcoin security will participate in Bitcoin XT it is therefore not clear that Bitcoin XT will have the resources or expertise to maintain its safety and security on a small side note I managed to dig up some of the private conversations that were taking place in June of 2015 one of the really interesting logs I found came from June 16th of that year in the months leading up to Gavin making this proposal he was trying to raise the block size for a very long time block stream CEO Adam back was acting like they were in favor of increasing the block size but they were just acting like he needed to go through the consensus process but they essentially would never get back to Gavin they were fully aware that this would never reach consensus among the five developers with commit access because two out of those five are blocked stream co-founders and they were basically gaslighting Gavin to waste this time while they could work on their side chain solution I have copied this conversation over so they can't delete it and it's in a paste bin that you can find in the description in this chat log Mike Hearn references how he's heard from investors at block stream has the power to stop changes from going through in Bitcoin Gavin mentions that this conversation would go a lot better if we could all assume that we all had the best intentions and in this chat he references Bitcoin of being controlled by a Council of Elders despite the fact that a vast majority was in favor of increasing the block size I will leave this in description for you guys to read through as I think it gives you plenty of insight into what pushed Gavin to try and do a coup to be fair I want to recognize that both sides here we're vying for control over the project but as it starts to play out I lean more towards Gavin having better intentions [Music] I know this is a bit confusing so I want to do a brief recap of what we've covered thus far basically by this time bitcoin has become successful and no longer fears regulation from the government since it no longer fears the same regulation the primary focus is skilling the network so more people can send money on it Satoshi originally planned on having a hard fork which would create a new currency with a larger block size higher than one megabyte a group of developers funded by venture capital plans on profiting by keeping the block size small Gavin likely realizes this is happening and creates his Bitcoin improvement proposal one on one to try and regain control for this to happen Gavin has to get 75% of the miners to start using his version of the software and finally block stream CEO made a subtle threat about security towards Bitcoin XT now hopefully you understand what's going on because shits about to get way more hectic after Gavin posted VIP 101 it really created a sense of urgency to update Bitcoin nobody wanted to get left behind and miners needed to cast their vote and make an informed decision naturally for people to stay up to date they had to go to one of bitcoins main discussion boards and at the time are sloshed Bitcoin it was the main hub for discussion but where this gets incredibly sketchy is when moderators of our Asajj Bitcoin them ban all discussion of Bitcoin XT now I'm no genius here but how is anyone supposed to make an informed decision if they can't discuss the topic [Music] now you're probably saying well why wouldn't people just go somewhere else well when you consider that both Bitcoin talk and are such Bitcoin or the only main discussion boards with any traffic and they're both owned by the same person and that person may or may not have had financial dealings with block stream and the thing you're voting on is time sensitive so you don't have time to create a new community altogether makes it look like you're trying to force your will on the community I mean when you have someone directly on block streams payroll stating things like manipulating public opinion isn't censorship famous is one of the most anti censorship people I know and I'm not aware of any evidence that are Asajj Bitcoin engages in censorship and then a conversation comes out with a most stating that the way operate our Asajj Bitcoin is consistent with self ownership our Asajj Bitcoin is a private centralized website I am free to operate it as I wish I am under no ethical obligation to allow total free speech just because I believe in self ownership and my personal favorite and this is in accordance with my principles I don't take free speech to be an ethical axiom there would have been no way to prove that this conversation was real until they most acknowledged it himself now this is a complete 180 from what they most used to say before block stream was founded the free and open discussion on this forum helped individuals in the Bitcoin community achieve truth everyone has some wisdom or knowledge to contribute to a discussion and everyone who reads the discussion and gains that knowledge gets closer to the truth this is much more effective than having truth dictated by a handful of moderators or voted on by an electorate so what could have happened since 2013 that made you change your mind block stream CEO later admitted that they most was censoring the subreddit to however they claimed that the reason to justify this was because there was vote manipulation going on they later at least a study for proof of this situation but I find it incredibly convenient that the person who conducted this vote manipulation study was one of the people participating in censorship furthermore I also looked through the study in the sample data they used was six months after this event took place and I'm highly skeptical because a reddit makes it incredibly hard to track any upvote metrics on their site most of the people being down voted in this data set were the people that were censoring the community and were rightfully hated it's funny that bash ko would even post a study because even he admitted that the situation escalated the censorship months before now how do we know that famous has involvement with Blanc stream well in 2011 they most mentioned that if people wanted to donate he would add improvements to the forum this was the amount of Bitcoin received to his address now after two years went by and nothing happened some people started to ask what was going on they must then mentioned that he planned on creating a new forum software and instead of you know getting help from a community of open-source developers he ended up hiring a no-name studio by the name of slick äj-- for a hundred K a month and tell me how does a no-name studio land a client for a hundred K a month when they operated out of this rundown apartment inside the technical documents of slicka jizz github a person by the name of warren ats leakage comm was found people ended up finding out this person just happens to be the same warren tegami that works at block stream this means that when this was found he was working at the same company famous hired and blocked stream simultaneously I understand that developers can have multiple jobs and it doesn't necessarily mean conflict of interest but when this company was only used because Warren tegami used to help they most with the forum and to top that off this company reports nowhere close to a hundred K a month in revenue yet has continued on famous as forum software and it's 20/20 and everyone's still using the old forum something isn't adding up here to be fair both Warren and famous denied any conflict of interest they claimed that this evidence was being used to push a conspiracy theory that block stream at hijacked Bitcoin core but when I tell you who Satoshi Nakamoto is I think it'll be as clear as day as to what's going on here [Music] on August 15 2015 Mike Hearn would write to the Bitcoin mailing list hello as promised we have released Bitcoin XT which includes the bigger blocks patch set you can get it from here I feel sad that it's come to this but there is no other way the Bitcoin core project has drifted so far away from the principles myself and many others feel are important that a fork is the only way to fix things after Bitcoin XT was launched it saw a reasonable amount of success despite one side having full control over discussion many new nodes were running the software meanwhile on the forums individuals were calling forth a MOS and moderators to step down due to this monopoly over discussion and no compromise being made this event divided the community to this day and this event popularized the subreddit by the name of R / BTC while the subreddit generally caters to Bitcoin cash it originated to discuss Bitcoin free from the most censorship 40 minutes after Mike Hearn had posted about Bitcoin XT Satoshi would respond I've been following the recent block size debates through the mailing list I had hoped the debate would resolve and a fork proposal would achieve a widespread consensus however with the formal release of Bitcoin XT and this looks unlikely to happen and so I'm forced to share my concerns about this very dangerous fork the developers of this pretender Bitcoin claimed to be following my original vision but nothing could be further from the truth when I designed Bitcoin I designed it in such a way as to make further modifications to the consensus rules it difficult without near unanimous agreement Bitcoin was designed to be protected from the influence of charismatic leaders even if their name is Gavin Anderson Barack Obama or Satoshi Nakamoto nearly everyone has to agree on a change and they have to do it without being forced or pressured into it by doing a fork in this way these developers are violating the original vision they claimed to honor they use my old writings to make claims about what bitcoin was supposed to be however I acknowledge that a lot has changed since that time and a new knowledge has been gained that contradicts some of my early opinions for example I didn't anticipate pooled mining and its effects on the security of the network making Bitcoin a competitive monetary system while also preserving its security properties is not a trivial problem and we should take more time to come up with a robust solution I suspect we need a better incentive for users to run nodes instead of relying solely on altruism if two developers can fork Bitcoin and succeed in redefining what bitcoin is in the face of widespread technical criticism and through the use of populist tactics then I will have no choice but to declare bitcoin a failed project Bitcoin was meant to be both technically and socially robust this present situation has been very disappointing to watch unfold Satoshi Nakamoto soon after many threads started to pop up that someone was attacking Bitcoin XT nodes kicking them offline made them unable to vote Bitcoin XT was supposed to reach consensus by January 1st 2016 and between the span of August to December two separate conferences were held by the name of scaling Bitcoin I want to point out that 2015 was the only year that they held two of these [Music] Bitcoin XT failed to reach a 75% consensus and on January 28 2016 the patch was reverted I personally believe it to be very apparent that Bitcoin core didn't play by the rules in my opinion that this was a community power struggle anyone who supported Bitcoin XT was ousted from Bitcoin core coinbase for example supported Bitcoin XT and then had themselves deleted off the Bitcoin org website I believe that everyone knows who Satoshi is a Bitcoin core and the reason you're probably not seeing anyone speak out is because of something called a nondisclosure agreement so when Gavin came out publicly and said this I do think Craig is Satoshi I met with him in London he fits the kind of person that I was interacting with way back in 2010 and he provided some cryptographic proof using the private key from the very first Bitcoin block to show that he possessed that key so although it's impossible to prove something like that 100% I think for me he's proved it beyond a reasonable doubt Gavin later mentioned that there was a chance he could have been bamboozled by Craig right but I personally think he never thought that Craig Wright was Satoshi and he was in on it Craig Wright has been someone who is known to have wanted to have a larger block size it makes sense that Gavin named someone else's Satoshi because he wanted to win community support over the block size if Bitcoin core didn't know who Satoshi Nakamoto was then why would they revoke Gavin's commit access as soon as he named Craig Wright as Satoshi they upheld a revoking his commit access despite knowing he wasn't hacked it's almost like they didn't want to see any evidence because they already know who he is before I cut to the chase there is one Reddit comment I want to read from Gavin in this thread sharing an article about how Craig may have tricked Gavin someone insinuated that Gavin might know a little bit more about the situation than he zhan gavin replied i won't violate people's privacy or repeat things told to me under non-disclosure agreements so I'm stuck I'm not gonna say anything more except I suspect someday the full story will come out and it'll be made into a movie [Music] I'm convinced this message is a hundred percent real and I think you vote too when I tell you who Satoshi is but I completely understand everyone's skepticism with all the things going on in the community at the time the email originates from the original visto mail servers and was not spoofed in any way the domain owner hadn't changed since 2007 this email was never compromised now let's take a look at the writing style notice the double spaced after a period and Satoshi writes in British English notice the spelling of honor you know there's still some room for doubt here but that's kind of the point I'm certain he could have proved his identity but the goal of this message was to influence people once Bitcoin XT failed there was no longer a reason to follow up our final clue is that Satoshi Nakamoto is against a larger block size in the present day and it's time for me to reveal who he is when it comes to this or any topic I have to say the simplest answer is likely correct and it's no surprise that one candidate literally matches every single detail to Satoshi Nakamoto despite how many people will tell you that Satoshi Nakamoto was a collective or Satoshi Nakamoto was made by the government there's not really any evidence to suggest that if you recall from part two I stated that Satoshi was either trying to throw us off the trail at every given opportunity or the clues should be taken at face value as it turns out he didn't go to that great of lengths to hide his identity the first clues that we should take a look at are which technical documents were used to create Satoshi's white paper there are only two core ideas that were infused into the creation of Bitcoin sure you had a lot of applied cryptography and other aspects of the project but the main a thousand-foot inspiration was the b money proposal as outlined all of the ideas for a digital ledger that we see in the blockchain and the second component was the proof of work system also known as hash cash this used in the Bitcoin mining function and is used to verify all of our transactions the person who invented hash cash was Adam back block stream CEO and throughout this video you may have noticed that put some importance on blocked streams attachment to a lot of the things that we're going on in 2015 so let's take a look at mr. Adam back Adam back is referenced in Satoshi nakamoto's a very first email this email was sent to Wade I and in this message Satoshi was reaching out because he wanted to get the date of publication for Wade eyes B money the email reads I was very interested to read your be money page I'm getting ready to release a paper that expands on your ideas into a complete working system Adam back at Hashcash org notice the similarities in point me to your site this email implies another message was sent to Adam back but what's interesting here is that Satoshi supposedly corresponded with him but there's no evidence to ever suggest that we have correspondence between Satoshi and basically everyone else except for Adam back when Adam has been asked about it he'll always virtue signal and say that he would delete or shred any evidence that's interesting that you want to protect Satoshi in this case but when someone who obviously isn't Satoshi like Paula rue makes a headline you'll spread obvious misinformation that's incredibly convenient because after going down this rabbit hole I'm convinced that emails never existed in the first place the day that B money was announced it didn't get any attention there's only about nine discussion threads in the cryptography mailing list about this B money proposal and two of them are about the link being broken this paper was so obscure that the person who actually wrote about it was Adam back don't get it twisted wait I definitely wrote the paper but Adam back copied the paper on to the cryptography mailing list and asked for feedback in the next email in this thread it basically outlines the entire thing the B money seems to be a book entry e cash system related to hash cash the book open and distributed anonymity is derived from the fact that participants can be sued anonymous hash cash would be a good candidate function for ways decentralized minting idea to create value you burn CPU time just like hash cash but ways distributed open book entry system allows you to suit anonymously exchange so here we directly see that Adam just said that be money would be a candidate for hash cash and even mentions that pseudonyms would be a great way to get money out anonymously hmm I've looked through all the discussion on B money on the various mailing lists and most people didn't even like the idea now if you're wondering whether Adam back could have pulled it off I would say a hundred percent yes he's the perfect candidate the guy has a PhD in distributed computing systems which should be the perfect background for building a decentralized computer network bitcoin was coded in C++ and atom codes proficiently in C++ something we need to consider is that Satoshi Nakamoto is an inventor he created a new piece of technology and this guy was filing multiple patents a year up until April of 2005 and then he just disappears until March 2010 which is a full year after Bitcoin was released I looked through all of the mailing lists that his email was associated to and he goes dormant from oh seven until 2010 he was also not writing any academic papers during this time according to Adam back Satoshi supposedly even sent him the software once it was released but according to him he shrugged it off and didn't mind a single Bitcoin Adam has never provided proof of these emails either now I know you're thinking well maybe Adam didn't have any interest in anonymous payments anymore after all that was back in 1998 but here's the thing around 2007 right when Satoshi started on bitcoins development if you read Adam Beck's Wikipedia page which he wrote himself it reads he has an interest in privacy technology and electronic cash so you had time to update your Wikipedia information stating that you're interested in anonymous payment systems right when Satoshi started development on Bitcoin but when Satoshi finally figured out how to do something that you planned on doing since 1998 you don't even bother to open the software how convenient it's not like you were busy during this time call me crazy but if we dive deeper into Adam back more coincidences to start lining up what about Satoshi's writing style well if you recall from part one uses British English and whenever possible he's known to use double spaced after each period Adam back frequently includes double spacing after each since in his various writings and he's British so British English is also included remember how Satoshi hit a political message inside the Genesis block that references The Times a UK newspaper well what if I told you Adam back is known for leaving political messages with compact code and he grew up in London where The Times newspaper was distributed moving on not many people know this but web design wasn't satoshi specialty he actually received help in creating the forums from a guy named Marty Malmi but if you take a look at the earliest capture of Bitcoin org when it was done by Satoshi it's incredibly minimalistic and if you take a look at cyberspace org add a max website and look at the earliest capture it looks incredibly similar to Bitcoin and layout Satoshi Nakamoto also looked up to Hal Finney do you know who else looked up to Hal Finney Adam back as I mentioned earlier there's a large gap in had a max digital footprint and he reappears on Twitter in 2010 when he resurfaces he becomes a resident of Malta Malta is the location you move to if you're about to receive a large amount of money that you don't want to be taxed heavily on do you remember from part 1 when Satoshi said I make this appeal to WikiLeaks not to use Bitcoin if you dig through atom backs 19,000 tweets to the very beginning when he took to Twitter his first year on the platform was him advocating about the discussion of WikiLeaks in 2012 he started updating Wikipedia articles about Bitcoin providing detailed insight into the history of it but something you should know is it the guy didn't get involved with Bitcoin until April of 2013 once again this guy cared enough about bitcoins history to update its Wikipedia article but not enough to mine a single Bitcoin it's also incredibly interesting that block stream and its entire purpose is to hire people to further the development of Bitcoin the guy has received over a hundred million in funding but here's the thing he's never once committed a single line of code hmmm how would these investors know the guys qualified to further development of Bitcoin if he's never touched the thing either these are the world's dumbest investors or he's Satoshi Nakamoto do you guys want another date that Adam back it does finally join the Bitcoin forums and start participating in the community April 17 2013 this is the exact date that an article by the name of the well deserved fortune of Satoshi Nakamoto came out he joined back the day everyone figured out how much money Satoshi Nakamoto had in his introductory post he starts off bossing people around he doesn't have a natural progression into the community whatsoever his first post is telling others to fix certain explanations on the Bitcoin wiki a few days later someone ended up linking the post about Satoshi nakamoto's fortune on the forums and Adam chimed in saying well that's kind of an unfortunate privacy bug coincidentally I thought I fixed a few potential issues like this in Hashcash for Satoshi now maybe he can find a private buyer via a lawyer and Swiss banking services or perhaps were forced to implement Xero coin to protect him anyway don't sweat it people he can probably get by on a few million play money and his post privacy bug fix mining horde until there's a solution on his pose when was that bug fixed by the way I can't tell from those low res graphs and he's probably holding out for the 10k Bitcoin era anyway have you ever noticed that we only know about satoshis first year of mining well it's incredibly interesting here that Adam back implies an entirely separate hoard of coins and the bug-fix he's referring to is so incredibly obscure how would you know about a mining bug-fix that was never included in the changelogs in 2010 when you supposedly got to the forum two days ago and the fact that he mentioned these Swiss banking services that are confidential that might explain why block stream shifted gears to profit off the block size being small we may never know because Adam back just like block stream never wants to make the financial intentions clear later on Adam back actually wrote to the author of this article and said question for the blog author when was that bug fixed what proportion of the 130 mil did he spend or cash that's just curiosity and I suppose it seems that you're getting too close you might want to stop in Kimora's interests [Music] what I want to clarify here with this entire video is and I'm not saying Satoshi doesn't deserve as wealth or that he doesn't deserve to have control over the project but what I can see a lot of people having a problem with is when you act like bitcoin is this community driven project furthermore acting like Satoshi is living this private life and has to hide from government agencies is a complete virtue signaling lie and this claim that his privacy needs to remain a secret just because people might come after him for his coins is complete [ __ ] when you consider that other currencies have faces to them and they can guard their wealth with no problem that's like saying every rich person has to hide away from the public this person gives public talks this person has 150 thousand followers on Twitter and this person is a spokesman for a business do you want to know the real reason Satoshi hasn't revealed his identity I'll let Adam tell you himself so first one in your opinion who is Satoshi Nakamoto I really don't know I would suspect it's one person just because of you know consistency of code and difficulty of keeping privacy and secrets across a group but other than that you know we I think nobody really knows if you had an opportunity to to know who is it well I think actually it's better that we don't know because it helps for Bitcoin to be considered like a digital commodity that you know there was something that discovered the kamati but there's not somebody people have a background in hierarchical thinking so some people are wide a little bit different than they don't like Authority and they want to think for themselves but many things about society are hierarchical and so if you look at what the media tends to do it's a mass market media any average person they see something new anyone like who's in charge of it who should I ask could we ask somebody to change something if it doesn't do this and say you know if there was an identified founder that thinking would leads lots of people to asking or demanding things so the fact that founder is kind of apocryphal the news in person wait he's not coming back at this point right that that takes away that opportunity which I mean heaven forbid people think for themselves and that seems to be a common theme in the Bitcoin project in 2015 the entire community was in favor of increasing the block size but block stream and all the other developers forced that upon everyone else considering that bitcoin is supposed to be the censorship proof money that's really really ironic and not to mention the blatant manipulation when Satoshi wrote that everyone has to agree on a change if you ever use our slash Bitcoin in the present day it's still heavily censored you're not allowed to be critical of Bitcoin in any way forget that a lot of other projects have already fixed its problems because if you don't and you don't put your faith in it then Satoshi Nakamoto can't deliver you from the evil banks heaven forbid people in a community-driven project ask for something to be catered towards the community the problem here is a conflict of interest with hiding your identity you have two sets of investors to please those who invest in Bitcoin who wanted to succeed in the long term and investors of block stream who want to push transactions off the main network to make money and you know you've created a borderline cult when the same people that used to be obsessed with decentralization now actively support block streams alternative centralized Network this situation has been very disappointing to watch unfold this is barely sociable have a good night [Music] [Music] you [Music]",40:21
ZAYZWgGxKO4,Lex Clips,"Blog,Science",Are we headed toward a civil war? | Eric Weinstein and Lex Fridman,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAYZWgGxKO4,,427K views,"Blog,Science",the reason i was i was kept bothering you kept bothering to have this conversation is i'm really worried about the next couple of months no kidding and out if there's anybody in this world that could help alleviate my worry by by at least walking along with me through this worry of mine it's you do you think we're headed towards some kind of civil war some kind of division that explodes beyond just stuff on twitter but something that's really destruct destructive to the fabric of our society well i i believe we're in a revolution as you know i've called it the no name revolution or n squared revolution i've been talking about it for years i don't think i think waiting for this to be called a civil war is not smart only history we'll call it such fine but i think that the problem is is that you're encountering things that you've never seen trying to fit them into things that you already know right and but history repeats itself yes ish you don't see lessons from history and i do we see today but i don't see it repeating itself you know the the violent famous quote is that it rhymes it rhymes i mean the thing i guess i'm speaking to is violence and we're in there the abstraction of violence imagine you were coding up violence as an abstract class okay thank you for speaking to the audience trying to lose these people come with me go on i don't know i i i've dealt with your audience and your audience contains the smartest people around yeah i guarantee you if i say some stuff uh first of all any wrong thing that i'll say they're gonna detail so that'll be a little bit of catnip to bring in the smart people but they'll also digest it for each other it's one of the great lessons of long-form podcasting if you don't if you don't waste all your time explaining things that's the job of the audience to do amongst themselves they're happy doing the work and those who aren't they leave isn't that great they'll leave the people who don't want to struggle will leave you can get rid of them i think that the point is you you would want to say violence is defined relative to a context so let's call it meta-violence so that we don't get into the the problem we already have a term for physical violence right so we have meta violence and physical violence i would say that physical violence is subclassed from meta violence meta violence is the disruption of a system it's sort of you know it's a you know if we for example if a cell dies you can die through apoptosis or necrosis apoptosis is controlled programmed cell death uh necrosis is just like okay this didn't work that was a violent disruption of the system and this meta class is presumed in the documentation is it all negative no what are you talking about so this is part of the problem in the madness of our age right which is if you if you open up a drawer in your in your cabinet right in your kitchen and you see knives spoons and forks do you have a sense that the spoons are good utensils and the knives or forks or bad utensils because they're mean i mean like if you start thinking in these terms yeah that knife is there to do violence that's violence you want done right when i cut a mango i'm doing violence to the mango the mango expects that i will do violence to it because otherwise it i won't be able to get the the meat and it won't get its seed um spread somewhere else so in part violence is absolutely part of our story so okay so there's this meta-violence class yeah and what's so the meta-violence class is already you know it's a multiple inheritance pattern whatever's going on right now inherits from meta violence no but there's there's certain subclasses that allow evil to emerge so what what i'm specifically worried about is that what's on your mind like what's really going on okay i i worry that um amidst the chaos of we have these protests or the chaos that could be created by the feeling that the election does not represent the the voice of the people like saying that whoever gets quote unquote wins the election according to the some kind of reporting of the numbers that come out that's not going to represent what people actually who people actually want to be the leader like something in that narrative will create so much division that people will resort to literal violence like protests that really that the united states loses its united aspect and because of that because of that chaos and tension evil evil people evil forces that my definition of evil is you know just cruel human beings use that moment to attain power the kind of power that is ultimately goes against the ideal of the united states that could be donald trump that could be another human being it doesn't really matter the my my worry is that love doesn't win out in this the unity doesn't went out in this and i feel like you and i have responsibility no small yeah i know and so how do we let love win in this moment of we're going to potentially you're going to have to become a fighter and you have to you have to throw some serious punches if that's what you want you have to be muhammad ali here because the moment you start criticizing anything yeah people you have to be a masterful communicator because that's why you're here look lex in part your decency is allowing you to do things that you couldn't otherwise do i saw that you had michael malus on your podcast yeah now michael malus is i think of somebody who at his best is extremely shrewd and insightful yes he's also got this trolling game which he's quite open about and you talk to him about it which i can't stand and that's this is the idea oh grandpa doesn't get the internet well i'm grandpa i don't get the internet i don't love the trolling yeah there are trolls of the past who were incredibly good i don't see any of the modern trolls as being that kind of genius level trolling the people who deserve it in the way that they deserve it you know right now what i see is that anything that stands up gets cut down yeah you know it's like anything earnest you have to turn into cynicism and a meme and it's this idea that the people who believe that the world is chaos and has no point are constantly trying to let you know don't try to use the internet for meaning for decency for goodness because we are going to find out that that's all sanctimonious hypocrisy and we will we will make you suffer so i do think that there's a lot of sanctimonious hypocrisy in the world some of it mine some of it yours but we all have it and the trolls somewhat remove that but it's not a judicious kind constructive compassion a caring version most of the time and a lot of those trolls and i i have this feeling about michael malus i don't know whether it's right that there's somebody who deeply cares and loves beneath it and that that's motivating some of the trolling behavior and you and i don't seem to be doing that i don't see you as almost ever trolling yeah you and i are i i'm very much against trolling i'm very much against trolling it doesn't mean that in selective you know i'm not even it's not even true like everything we say we say like i'm forward i'm against it this isn't my native language i speak nuance i don't speak this internet [ __ ] and the more i have to communicate through internet [ __ ] right i almost never take a tweet seriously if it contains the the letters lmao lol rtfl you know fol there's a interesting effect where people say stuff and then finish with lol you put it beautifully that it indicates to me that this is a person we've talked about like why i wear this stupid suit yeah it's like this is anti this is to fight the lol at the end of sentences is take it's like stand out for the words you're saying yeah don't finish stuff with lol removing completely the responsibility of the content of the sentence that preceded it yeah also choosing the outfit that worked both for men in black and the blues brothers not a terrible choice okay but getting back look lex we're not in a position to do this you need to be seated in a different chair your chair is the wrong chair you're in the wrong chair it's been so long all right i want to talk about you and joe biden joe biden was a 29 year old guy with nothing particular going on so far as i can tell okay i know people as impressive at age 29 as joe biden you know 12 rows back three three deep doesn't matter a huge number of people none of them my age can get to where he got like we're all morons anytime somebody takes out like if you found eddie van halen in a guitar shop you'd be angry what is this guy doing repairing guitars then somebody said maybe he loves to repair guitars i mean what is your piano russian piano tuna doing what is my russian piano that was the whole point of that story which is what is it that happened in that life that converted somebody and i find this for example with russian doctors who are you know technicians in offices now there's a huge amount of talent in the world that's not sitting in its proper seat yeah and quite honestly i've gotten to the point where my feeling is we've got to take the seats right maybe we don't sit in them maybe the idea is that we take the seats and we put some smart gen z person in the seat and say look no chanting i don't want to hear you say no justice no peace if there aren't verbs if if it rhymes it's wrong like i used to have this thing if it rhymes things that rhyme are more true but like in general if something starts out one two three four i don't wanna hear what the rest of your sentences you,11:56
5VDnj8IEWNc,Abroad in Japan,Blog,What Teaching English in Japan was REALLY Like,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDnj8IEWNc,,4M views,Blog,"I found this book at the back of my cupboard yesterday. It's a book filled with goodbye messages from Japanese students I used to teach. I got this on my last week as English teacher. Now I don't want to brag too much, but you'll get a sense of what a great English teacher I was and the positive impact I had, just by reading out a few of these messages. We've got one here from Yuka who says: 'Dear Chris, hello Chris,' 'Thank you so far :) It was always fun' Of course it was. 'Watch for a body, it will become big!!!!' 'VIP de BIG' [inhale] ... What? This was written, what... four years ago, and I still don't know what that means. I mean, to me 'VIP de BIG' sounds like a chronically overweight rapper. But perhaps it is alluding to the fact that at the time I was teaching, a lot of students and teachers were worried that I was putting on weight, just 'cause my diet was pretty awful. It does seem to be a recurring theme amongst a few of these messages... We've got one here from Karen who says: 'Dear Chris,' 'Thank you for teaching English until now!!' 'It was fun to be able to club together.' It's important to point out for legal reasons: I didn't go clubbing with underage students, she is just referring to the after school English club. And she continues, 'Please be 'stomach' much more healthy in the future!!' Please be stomach... much more healthy... in the future... Well, I did heed her words - I'm not yet entirely stomach. But, it's just nice, y'know, reading through these... ... heartwarming comments. It reminds me of a simpler time. A time when I used to teach English in a room to thousands of students. And today, given that I've discovered lots of stuff from my past, I thought I would discuss teaching English in Japan because it's a popularly requested topic, and I've got a lot of stories and experience from my time, teaching with over 2000 hours of classroom experience, that I can draw upon. I'm not gonna hold back on my opinions today on the teaching methods, the teachers, the students, the environment - I'll try and cover it all so you know what you're getting into if you should follow a similar path. Now I'll be open up-front about the fact that I didn't come to Japan because I was excited about the prospect of teaching English. Like 80% of people, I came to teach English in Japan because I was excited about the prospect of living in Japan. In my rare defence, I did take a short course on teaching English as a foreign language at my university, and my degree was in business and English linguistics. So, y'know, I can speak really good at English words. ... I- yeah, I know all the most best words that there... that there are-- uhh, that there is. ... This bunch of torn and tea-stained documents-- why is there a tea stain on it!? This is my original JET application - my application for the Japan Exchange Teaching Program, which I also discovered at the back of my wardrobe. I didn't even know I had this still! Now I know the criteria for getting on the JET Program or getting a job teaching English in Japan, I can see that my application has none of those things. I mean, it's so bad that I even wrote about a holiday that I had in Dubai as an example of culture shock and how I'd be able to adapt to culture shock in Japan. 'I was culture-shocked by Dubai because it was hot and there's lots of sand.' 'And I hate sand.' That's not even culture! That's just a geographical fact! And for the section on Japanese language ability, um... ... ... Yeah, it's just blank. There's nothing there. Nevertheless, with my wealth of cultural experiences, I got on the JET Program. I somehow passed the application process and I ended up with the role as an ALT - 'Assistant Language Teacher'. And I got placed right here, in a beautiful, rural area, where absolutely nobody feels the need to know English. Now I've heard a lot of people criticize the JET Program over the years, because they say that that money invested in the foreign teacher could be spent on Japanese teachers - it could be spent elsewhere in better ways. But lord knows, they need more foreigners in rural Japan. I once dated a Japanese girl from that town, and when it came to meeting her mum, her mum had never met a white person before, despite being 50-something. So I met her, and she was actually so scared of me that she hid behind her daughter. She was scared as if I was some sort of rabid dog who would rip her arm off which, y'know... I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't-- that's not the sort of thing I would do. To be fair, I did think of going along with it and being like, 'Oh yeah, pleased to meet you--- RaARRggh' But I didn't do that. 'Cause I'm not mental. The senior high school where I worked had about 1200 students. It was pretty big. And they were all aged 16-18. Within that school, there were about 12 English teachers, and 120 teachers in general. And I quickly found out when I arrived, that of the dozen teachers that I was gonna work with, only 8 of them actually spoke English. The others had somehow slipped the net. And I don't mean they spoke English badly, I mean they just genuinely really struggled to communicate in English which was quite a surreal situation to be in. I never held it against them. They were all over 50 years old, and I suspect when they did apply to teach English the extent of the language test must have just been... 'What is your favourite colour?' Uhhhhhhh... red. [finger snap] You're in! However, one of the things that I'd been taught during my long, tedious induction in Tokyo during the first week was that you should never correct a teacher in front of the classroom, lest you undermine them and make them look inferior in front of the class. So I spent my few first weeks conflicted, dying inside, because I wasn't sure if stepping in and telling the teacher that they were wrong would destroy my fragile relationship with my colleagues early on, y'know, which is really important. So let's do a 10-second pop quiz, and see what you would do. Choose your own adventure: A: Ignore the situation and carry on, or
B: Tell them it's wrong and change it. Answer now. ... Well done, the answer's B. Because what's the point of even being there if you're gonna stand in the corner and do nothing? And y'know what, I found, by correcting them, it never burned any bridges and they were grateful for the input. [ding] The worst classes though weren't with teachers that couldn't speak English, they were the ones with teachers who just didn't know how to use me in the classroom. And certainly, in my first year when I lacked confidence and I wasn't very assertive, more times than not, I was used as a human tape recorder - standing in front of the class repeating an endless list of words, and then having students repeat them back out loud to practice their pronunciation. 'Pheasant' [crowd repeats]: Pheasant 'Shrubbery' [crowd repeats]: Shrubbery 'Consequences' [crowd repeats]: Consequences
[that one person]: arara... By the time I was done, I must've said every single word in the English language at least four times. If you're already having a bad day, and you find yourself standing in front of a classroom, repeating words over and over, wondering why you spent £30,000 on a university degree, y'know, you do start to question if you've taken the right pathway in life. The only thing worse than being a human tape recorder was the actual tape recorder. Ohh, god. We had audio tapes from the '90s, voiced by awkwardly enthusiastic, yet ultimately unskilled American voice actors. They didn't speak like real American people. I've met an American person once, and it wasn't like that. It was like aliens had crash-landed in a garden in Oregon, belonging to a couple who were arguing, and an alien looked through the window and tried to mimic what they were saying in slow motion. [imitation of the stiff, robotic, alien-like American voice actors]: 'Hello Lucy. I am home.' [door closes]
(using capitals here in an attempt to portray how each word sounds like their own sentence...) Lucy: 'So Where Were You This Evening, John?'
(using capitals here in an attempt to portray how each word sounds like their own sentence...) John: 'Well, Lucy, I Was Working At The Office Again.' L: 'I Saw The Messages On Your Cellphone, John.' L: 'I Know What You've Been Doing.' J: 'Well, gee golly gosh, Lucy. Get Off My Back.' J: 'We're Not Going Over This Again.' L: 'I Have Had Enough Of Your Poor-Quality Attitude, John.' L: 'I am leaving you.' [door shuts] Comprehensive question 1: Why was Lucy suspicious of John? Ugh, it was a fucking nightmare. By that point I was practically begging to be a human tape recorder again. There were the teaching materials themselves, which had been written by non-native English speakers and came packed full of fun spelling errors, where you had to decide on the spot whether you went along with it, or tried to correct in on the fly. Although, some of them were simply beyond repair, like: 'Are you aware of your own defect?'!? [dunnnn] Although, to be fair, it is a great conversation starter for a first date. Once I had to read out a chapter from a textbook called 'Soccer Balls to Afghanistan', about how a Japanese school had hand-made 200 soccer balls to ship off to Afghan children during the conflict, which is brilliant, and noble, until I had to read out the phrase: 'when we showed the children the balls, they gave us big smiles.' 'It was like a magic!' Imagine reading that out in front of 40 teenagers, in a big, deep, booming voice, and then trying to maintain some degree of composure ... which I simply didn't do when I just laughed and looked like a sadistic bastard. Thankfully, though, after my first year, with a few hundred hours of classroom experience under my belt, I did become more proactive and assertive, and teachers became more confident leaving me in charge and letting me do my own thing. And that was really when I was in my element, because look: I made a magazine. 'Spl... Splendid Magazine'. ... Yeah. My unwavering hatred of Japanese English textbooks made me just throw them out the window. ... Not literally, unfortunately. Though I should've done... But I started doing practical things - I started getting students using the English they'd learned to do things like: short films, doing sketches, or in this case, making a magazine. And this was great - students spent time researching a topic, then writing it out, adding some photos in, and there's some good stuff in here! We've got Hayao Miyazaki... some handsome comedians... Oh yeah - McDonald's! Now we're talking. It did mean a lot of extra time and effort for me - I mean we did have to put this together - we binded it, we gave every student a copy, but it was worth it! The students enjoyed it, I had fun, and the teachers thought I was a genius for unleashing this groundbreaking concept - the concept of having fun in the classroom. Still, even if I was 'VIP de BIG', not all classes went smoothly. Like a gladiator charging into the arena, you always knew how things were gonna go the moment you set foot in the classroom. In about 70% of my classes, I was given a hero's welcome - to rapturous cheers and applause. Genuinely, it was brilliant. I'd walk in, everyone erupted, and you just knew it was gonna be an amazing hour. The students saw my presence as an opportunity to break from the norm and do something that wasn't just read out of a textbook. The other 30% of the classes were... not so good. I'd walk in, and feel like a convicted war criminal, because it'd just be silence and it'd be awkward, and you feel like: 'fuck, what have I done?' One problem you find in Japanese classrooms is: students are often reluctant to put their hands up. In the UK, if you take a class of 30 students and the teacher asks a question, you often get, y'know, 7 or 8 hands up. But in Japan, it was never more than two, in a room with 40 students. And it seems to be, in Japan, there's this culture around not making mistakes - the idea of making a mistake is really bad, and that starts off early on, especially in the classroom. And one of my most awkward memories of this happened in my first few weeks of teaching, when I was doing a class on British desserts. Now, one of the things we're encouraged to do as an English teacher is to introduce your culture into the classroom. In this case, British culture. And for this particular activity, I gave them a list of British desserts and the photos to go with them, and then they had to use their dictionaries to look up the words and try and work out which one went with which. Suffice to say, I made a spectacular blunder by adding 'spotted dick' into that list. [dunnn] Hilarity ensued.
[dunnn] And then after that activity, students had to memorise the words and then go up and spell it from memory on the chalkboard. But the hardest dessert to recall and spell on the board was the ice cream dessert 'knickerbocker glory', and to be fair, not even I really know how  to spell that. But, the only boy in the class bold enough to write it was a really shy kid at the front of the room who kind of kept to himself - he didn't talk to anyone, and for some reason he felt this, this was his moment. So he came up to the chalkboard and I said to him, 'Right. The word is 'knickerbocker glory'.' And he picked up the piece of chalk, and he wrote on the board, and this is true: 'Knicker Poker G'! Which, to me, sounds like a charismatic master of Texas holdem poker. And no sooner had he sat down that the class erupted into laughter - they found this hilarious as they could see that it was a spectacular error - they could see that he got it completely and utterly wrong. And I went along with it. I said, 'Oh, it's not 'Knicker Poker G', but that'd be a great name - that'd be a cool name.' And amidst the laughter, all of a sudden there was a loud banging noise, and the guy had thrown his textbooks all over the room, he'd banged the fucking table, and he started kicking the desk - it was really awkward! And the whole room just went silent straight away. The teacher had to jump in and say 'Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry about this... Everybody, stop laughing'... But It made me realise why students often don't try to make mistakes. Why stand out and get laughed at when you can just keep your head down and do nothing? Fortunately, that experience did happen early on, and for the next two years, whenever a student put their hand up or took a risk, regardless of whether they got the question right or not, I would encourage them or reward them - I'd give them a high five, I'd say well done - anything to show that to try and fail is an important part of language learning. I wanted them to adopt a risk-taking mentality. Y'know, the sort of risk-taking mentality you'd expect from someone like Knicker Poker G. As you could probably imagine, I wasn't overly serious, and I didn't want students to feel intimidated when coming over to me and just chatting with me in the corridor. I didn't want a repeat of my ex-girlfriend's mum by all accounts. And because they were senior students on the brink of making big life decisions, I loved chatting to them about their dreams and aspirations in life. I remember one time we did a lesson on life goals, and as an initial example I talked about how when I was a kid - when I was your age, I wanted to be James Bond. But unfortunately, for various reasons, that... that didn't work out. And, the class genuinely felt sorry for me, that I had not been able to fulfil my dream of becoming a fictional character. Nevertheless, the next day, I went to the staffroom, and I went to my desk and I found this on it: It's a poster for the James Bond film 'Skyfall'. There's a little note on it that says: 'Dear Chris,' 'I think you can still make it. Don't give up your dream, not to regret.' 'From Bondgirl.' How amazing is that? I mean, this alone just shows you how awesome the students are. And you know what, everyday I look at this poster on the wall, and I know, if I believe in it hard enough, my dream of becoming James Bond still won't come true. Objectively speaking, was I a good English teacher? 'Course I fucking was, I made a magazine, didn't I? No, in my first year, I was awful. I lacked experience, I lacked confidence, and I spent far too much time sitting in the staffroom at my desk with my head down. But, by my second year, I could just walk into a classroom at a moment's notice and conjure up a lesson plan out of thin air. I knew dozens of students on a first-name basis and I got on really well with all the teachers. All in all, I really did love the job by my second year. And the teachers did a fantastic job of making you feel way more important than you actually were. I remember in my second year, I had to go and get the contract for my new year from the intimidating, but undeniably suave school principal. And he handed me the contract - the paper contract - like this: as if he were bestowing me with a legendary sword of some sort, and he looked at me, and he said in perfect English, for the first time I'd heard it, he said: 'We need your help, again.' And I said, 'Thank you.' And I took the paper, and it was spectacularly theatrical. I felt like a samurai who had just liberated a town from ruthless bandits. It's still the closest I've come to having my last samurai moment. So, unsurprisingly, I signed up for a third year after that. But, unfortunately, by that point the school principal had left, and we had a new school principal who wasn't quite as dramatic. And he handed me the paper and he said: 'Go and teach English.' And I went, 'Yeah, alright then...' Suffice to say, I didn't sign up for a fourth year. But, fundamentally, by that point I'd done everything I could, and I no longer felt like I was pushing myself or challenging myself anymore. And a lot of my favourite students had graduated and moved on, and I felt like it was time for me to move on as well. If you do ever teach in Japan, though, do hold on to, y'know, things like this. Because reading over comments, like the ones in this book, did take me back to a time in my life that brought me a lot more joy than I ever realised, spending my time alongside fantastic teachers and students who made everyday worth going into work. I can't say whether or not I had any real impact as a teacher, but I'd like to think for the 2000 or so hours that I stood there in front of the students in the classroom, I at least made their time studying the English language just that little bit more bearable. If I could go back in time to 2011 and meet my past self writing this JET application form in the university dorm, will I tell him to go through with it? Absolutely. I would tell him it's gonna be worth every minute of it. I would tell him it's gonna change him for the better. And perhaps, above all, I would tell him not to put his fucking cup of tea on the application form. 'Cause that's... that's an absolute disgrace, isn't it? So those are just a few stories from my three years as a teacher. I will be talking about more experiences in the future, but if you do have any comments or questions about teaching in Japan, fire away in the comments below, and I'll try and answer as many as I can. And finally, for more extra behind-the-scenes content, check out the Abroad in Japan patreon page. But for now guys, as always, many thanks for watching - I'll see you next time.",16:49

VrKW58MS12g,Mark Rober,Science,Glitterbomb Trap Catches Phone Scammer (who gets arrested),0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrKW58MS12g,10 months ago,54M views,Science,you've probably received a lot of spam calls that sounds something like this this is amazon.com you have been charged 379 now behind this harmless sounding call is a 20 billion scam industry and today we're gonna roll over that log and see what crawls out because for the past five months with the help of my trusty glitter bomb which i typically just reserved for porch pirates i've worked my way up every rung of the slimy chain of command involved in this scam this journey is going to take us around the world and through five states it involves homeland security stakeouts with pis and of course glitter bombs and the scammers trying to hopelessly rid themselves of sparkly evidence before getting arrested i'm going to show you exactly how they make so much money off these calls so buckle up cause it gets wild now all this started for me when i was working on glitter bomb 3.0 this past november and i kept getting those annoying calls so i thought maybe to return the favor i could send them my harmless box that shoots out glitter and fart spray when you remove the lid now my buddy jim browning has a youtube channel where he's able to reverse the connection to the scammer's computer and then thwart them in real time as they try and scan someone else my idea was to have a legitimate victim agree to send the money but then we'd work with them to actually send a glitter bomb instead so jim checked all the scammer computers he was currently monitoring and it just so happened a woman named tracy was being scammed for twelve thousand five hundred dollars at that very moment so he immediately tried reaching out to her and eventually got through hello hello tracy uh this is jim browning here again i'm calling you hopefully you've got my voicemail here's what happened now listen carefully to what tracy's about to say here and hold your judgment about how can anyone ever send 12 000 in the mail until i explain how the scam works in a minute because i hate to give these guys credit but it's pretty clever they were supposed to give me a refund of 300 and when i put in the computer i i mistyped it as as thirteen thousand dollars so i had to send money back to them twelve thousand five hundred dollars and that's where i am right i'm hoping you haven't sent that money i have said it oh no i hate to break this to you but this whole thing is a scam what do i do now because i'll tell you what to do tracy you leave this to me and jim the first thing we did was look up the address they told her to ship the money to and given there were six cameras outside this clearly was some kind of safe house for the scammers we then had tracy call fedex to cancel the package but just in case we hired two pis to be on the scene that day to intercept it and we knew we shouldn't do that right in front of the house because they'd probably be watching but since we weren't sure which direction the fedex truck would come from we overnight shipped a package to a bunch of their neighbors that explained they were randomly selected to win one of these super cool glitter bomb t-shirts and if you wanted to buy one of these from markrover.com to help support making more videos like this i'm certainly not going to stop you this would allow us to speak to the delivery driver somewhere up the street to get the package stopped in time and the plan worked flawlessly because despite tracy's efforts to get it stopped her package was in fact out on the truck for delivery tracy something yeah that's the one don't live with this one please okay this is the fraudulent one if that one's gone that's also going to 7-31 okay but in a wild twist there was a second package going to the same location addressed to the same fake name her name was phyllis and we later found out her package contained even more cash than tracy's okay so that one's going back right and then fedex was cool enough to eventually return the packages so both tracy and phyllis got all their money back and when the scammers angrily called tracy back asking why the package didn't arrive she explained she accidentally selected two-day shipping instead of next day air so they would get the package tomorrow and that's where he switched from defense to a very light offense and so the next day we deliver the package in an official looking vest have a good holiday thank you and waited for the sweet retribution hello you guys give up oh yeah thirsty for more [Music] but for the first time in three years of glitter bombing criminals someone didn't immediately throw the box outside and he just sat there with the wretched smell leaving the box untouched and then as we waited wondering what his game plan was gonna be suddenly a bunch of nypd officers started showing up and it didn't take them long to figure things out it's a glitter bomb it has a camera built into it there's a camera built into this we had a phone number on the box and they called us up and i explained the whole situation and i'll just say there was some mutual admiration for each other's work i mean there might be cameras on there officer and as it happens the reason the scammer would call the cops on himself is cause he isn't a scammer this is gary and it turns out he's a super nice guy but gary runs an airbnb and once you go in that door there are two rooms upstairs that he rents out to people so this wasn't a safe house at all these scammers would use airbnb to get a temporary address they would only use once but if that's true that meant the scammers must have been there yesterday so gary showed us his security footage and we saw this woman in an orange jacket who appeared right as the pi was talking with the fedex driver up the street she also looks directly at the camera and then decides it's probably cold enough outside to zip her jacket all the way up once the fedex truck passes and she realizes he's skipped by her she hurries over to talk to him and when he told her he had nothing for her for that day she walks right back to her car never stepping foot inside the airbnb the pi's got all the license plates on the street that day and it turns out her name is crystal you should remember that name for later so then gary showed us who booked the room it was this guy from utah with a brand new account and zero reviews in fact when the reservation was booked he sent this message in awkward english at 306 am which happens to be just after lunch in india so i did some more research and learned that after the scammer in india found a willing victim they would use a money mule and have the victim send the cash there so crystal in this case was the mule but instead of sending the package to the money mule's house they use an airbnb then the mule gives the package to a supervisor who deposits the cash and wire transfers the remaining money back to the scammer and they must have got spooked because crystal was long gone the next day which meant we caught poor gary in the crossfire but he wanted them caught just as much as us so we compensated him handsomely just for being cool about everything so we'll call that round a tie we stopped the scammers from receiving two packages containing thirty thousand dollars but they were still glitter free but before i show you exactly how we tipped the scales in our favor let me explain exactly how this scam works so well at tricking so many people there's an email that goes along with the scam that basically says the same thing as the robocall which is amazon just charged you 200 but if you don't recognize this charge please call right away to have it refunded so when you call they say i'd be happy to walk you through the refund process on your computer so just type this here and simply install this and then i'll be able to fully help you out and most victims don't really comprehend they've just installed a remote software program that gives the scammers full access to their computer now they're ready for the scam they tell her that some accounts have actually already had their refunds automatically processed so she needs to check her bank account to make sure the 200 refund isn't already there and when bessie here asks if he can see her banking info he explains in technical terms it's a 3d page so i cannot see anything oh okay and so sure enough she hasn't got the refund yet so he needs just about five minutes to work with his billing department in order to process it but first he makes a really big deal about this i'm signing out from your account in front of your own eyes and this is true he actually does sign out at which point he triggers her screen to go black so she can't see anything that he's doing and then he immediately logs back in using the browser pre-stored username and password he's going to do a simple browser html edit on this page to temporarily make this lowe's purchase look like a refund for twenty thousand dollars and you'll see why in a minute and as he's editing away he chats her up to try and build trust you're like my granny miss bessie do you know this yes she was like one of my closest for i used to share each and everything with her you mean like what you do for a living and you might be wondering why doesn't he just wire transfer himself money while he has unrestricted access to her account but the problem there is that it's traceable and it would likely get flagged by the bank's fraud detection system anyways but if you can get an old lady to mail you cash it's so untraceable the authorities don't even begin to try and track it down now that he's finished he unblinks her screen and he informs her that unfortunately the billing department couldn't process the refund so they have one last option to try this is the chase online different server it's actually just a text window that does absolutely nothing it's pure theater it is an irreversible form whatever you are typing it over there put it in a correct manner nothing would be changed over you basically he makes a big deal for three minutes that she's the one that has to enter all the information and anything that gets typed there is immediately permanent maybe you can see where this is headed so her name last four of social zip code and finally refund amount please enter your refund amount if you go back you can actually hear him type the two extra zeros on his keyboard and hit enter check everything is it correct oh no this is a mistake oh i screwed up jesus i'm it was supposed to be a 200 in there oh god almighty i'm exhausted i can't do this my mind is absolutely fried please check your account did you really receive that money in your account oh my god plus 20 000. yeah please save my job ma'am if i'll not earn for my family my family will die due to hunger due to starvation oh yes of course i mean what should i do i mean i can be bad for you you are also like my grandmother you know i'm an honest person right now you're making me cry now you're i'm getting attached to you how do i fix this he tells her that unfortunately mailing a check or wiring money would just take too long so he needs to think for a minute and then he comes back with this hello miss bessie yes i got an option and you can see now how he's got her to the point where she's totally willing to send twenty thousand dollars in the mail and to lie to the folks at the bank or fedex or even her family who might try and stop it in her mind she messed up and because she's a good empathetic person she'll go through great lengths to make it right for someone she doesn't realize is a heartless scammer and on top of weaponizing their empathy maintaining pressure on their victim is a key tactic they keep them on the phone the whole time even as they drive to the bank or they yell at them go to the ups why don't you go to the ups or call this many times in a row and if you've ever seen this clip name a woman name a woman yeah um you already know when you're under extreme stress it's an actual biological response for the part of our brain that does critical thinking to just shut down name a woman once they're back from the bank with the cash they coach them through packing it in tracy's case they had her put 100 bills in the pages of a book so it couldn't be detected in the mail in other cases they have the victims wrap the cash in saran wrap so the dogs can't sniff it and then foil so it can't be x-rayed but unfortunately there's a small portion of the population that are just too trusting for their own good and sadly it's nearly always older folks so for the scammers it's just a game of percentages to find them according to data jim is gathered from the scammer's own computers in one shift a call center like this with about 25 employees will send out a half a million robo calls they'll get about 500 calls back and land maybe five to ten victims like bessie or tracy or phyllis and speaking of phyllis after we got fedex to send back her package i was able to get in touch with her son and i found out her husband of 40 years had passed away the very week she was being scammed of her life savings the scammers knew she was mourning this loss but once you're scammed your phone number's really valuable because it means you're an easy mark so they sold her info to other scammers and she was scammed twice more the same week her husband died and as hard as it was for me to even hear a backstory like that it just made me that much more motivated to seek some glitter bomb retribution for all the phyllis's out there and perhaps in the process we might stumble upon some good information that we could pass on to the authorities so now we needed another scammer to send a glitter bomb to but we decided when jim spots a scam in progress it's better for him just to stop it cold and not stress out the victim any more than the rdr so we reached out to our friend pierogi from the youtube channel scammer payback because whenever pierogi gets a scam call to his actual phone he turns on his cameras makes his voice sound like an old lady and has some fun if they will ask you in your bank like why you are withdrawing that this much of cash what you gonna tell them um i'm getting it for derek wilson from microsoft no no mom no you need to tell them that you are withdrawing the cash for your personal reason for your personal reasons and it didn't take long for fake victim old woman pierogi to get us an address in new jersey this is where i'm sending it to you right grab box right so you can put the cash yeah i've already got a box i already got a box that's big enough this one was actually to a hotel and not an airbnb but as soon as we pulled up once again a money mule is out there waiting for us so they took the package and drove around for a couple of hours and when it was clear they weren't going to open it we made the call just to get the box back before the batteries died and then maybe the box audio recording might help us piece together more info on the scam you guys picked up a box from fedex today part of this cam i didn't have no scam going on today oh really no let's see the box i just was told i understand buy somebody to pick this up for them i understand yeah i don't know what's going on i'm being honestly and truthfully and i don't want no trouble and when i first heard that i was like oh well now i feel bad sometimes these mules don't even realize they're participating in scams and they might even be victims themselves then i was like look not that i don't believe her but maybe just in case we just have a little peek at the audio i'm waiting on so many packages i don't even know which one is which anymore then she got on the phone with her boss james yeah i know i got one with me right now i took the picture i said to you i'm gonna bring it to y'all that's what i'm saying said that i was done for the game but i gotta be at tomorrow you said that we was working out here in new jersey i don't know whatever they give me address that they don't even have a bmv address no nothing for tomorrow this is the first time they split me and crystal up like this in new jersey that's right crystal apparently they're a team which means jacqueline was probably in the car the other day in new york and the other side she in the car watching by the way crystal hate to say it but jacqueline was talking a lot of trash about you in fact i'd watch your back because her cousin in the car that day might be gunning for your job wanna be a driver how much did they get how much did you get for that one barcelona 500 everybody get paid so we get seven marshals and it's 75 or 100 dollars for each parcel everybody's getting 700 [Music] we learned two key things here the first is that a supervisor will have multiple mules reporting to them who apparently get flown all over the country and just one mule could receive as many as seven packages in a day and the second is that this address was from a totally different call center in india so that same supervisor can work with multiple unrelated scammers as well and so in the spirit of avenging phyllis if we were going to glitter bomb and fart spray anyone here in the states we really wanted it to be a supervisor and thanks to pierogi not long after we would get another chance uh get the dollars in cash with you get in your car once you're in your car let me know make sure you don't involve any third person nobody so i don't need to tell my husband your husband your father anyone this one would be in illinois and the delivery address this time was to a walgreens it was interesting to see them experimenting with different package drop-off methods and right away we heard some good news okay yeah i'll see you i see come park in front of me the walgreens was here and the handoff occurred here at this gas station [Music] and with that we had our supervisor they tell the supervisor for a few minutes and got a good look at his 2019 white honda passport and then 20 minutes later he stopped here in a seemingly random parking lot and opened it hello and even though he kept it by his feet the camera's got a perfect shot of his face here and the pis assessed the situation and felt safe enough to approach him right after he opened it but then he took off and they let him go and we just used the gps and the glitter bombs to once again locate it in the ditch snow and right after that proge got this message from the scammer in india which shows two things the supervisor and scammer are in close contact with each other and neither one likes glitter and that seemed like the end of the story until we ran the plates and realized his name was tied to a business really close to where he opened the box so we went back a week later to get footage to show just how close here's where he opened it you can see that dumpster and house for reference and then you pan over and that's the business his name is tied to and wait a second that's a 2019 honda passport and wait another second that's the same guy whose face is on camera opening the glitter mod so this was a nice little package of intel we were able to hand off to the authorities because the supervisor is sort of the hub and a direct connection between a bunch of mules in the states and a bunch of scammers in india perugi came through with one final address in texas and this one was back to the mo of being delivered to an airbnb and like all the others the mule's right there waiting for us and then she took it inside to open it [Applause] notice how she films herself opening the package apparently this is pretty common because i suppose there's no honor among thieves and the scammers will demand the video to confirm she hasn't taken more than she's allowed as we learned before the money mules make a flat amount per package like 100 bucks but i ended up reading somewhere that the supervisor gets a 10 percent cut and sends the rest back to the scammers this lady later admitted she herself was exchanging the cash for bitcoin to send back to the scammers which meant she was actually a supervisor and for the sake of phyllis that was a lovely surprise as well she took off and parked about a mile away but the police were alerted and were on her tail pretty quickly i cannot talk here i love that attempt at just getting away with the parking warning so she gets out of the car and i have to applaud the effort here but as every parent knows the only way she's getting rid of the evidence from her pants and car is by burning them both to the ground yeah so i just lawyer because i i'm uh in the probation home information officer i don't know what's happened okay so i want to contact with someone and so after she was taken into custody the police returned to the airbnb to gather evidence the dude on the left there is a detective and they already had her under investigation for another package scam so now they're bringing charges against her and the actual glitter bomb and footage is being held as evidence in the case we did one more in illinois and two more in california but i've decided against showing those because those scammers are being monitored as part of ongoing investigations in fact over the past four months jim perogia and i have been in contact with investigators from the respective local police departments the department of justice homeland security and the fbi and we've turned over to them every last bit of evidence we've stumbled upon so hopefully like me you now have a better understanding of how these scam calls operate and here's why that matters the authorities are cracking down more on these guys both here in the states and in india but it's sort of a game of whack-a-mole and another one will just pop up because the financial incentives are so great the only way to truly defeat this is by spreading awareness thereby making it ineffective so if you have someone in your life who's older that means a lot to you please educate them or even share this video with them i put some resources in the video description if you've been exposed to fraud but all the experts agree it's much better to not be reactive here but proactive by spreading awareness and understanding what this looks like and speaking of being proactive i will close with some good news which is that thanks to jim who explains how he did it in a video he just released on his channel we have the identifying information of the folks over in india who scammed our girl phyllis and by the way everyone in india hates these guys too and so over the next year of course working with the proper authorities we'll be executing a multi-phased operation that will be as always relatively harmless i don't want to give too much away but we already have some performance working for us in some of these call centers and the first phase might include a door handle and actual poop from phyllis's actual dog so make sure you're subscribed cause it's gonna be a banger you can set your plant on this box and it has some electronics inside to measure the soil moisture level and then talk to you when you walk by i need a little water over here that's delicious thank you and this machine measures how long it's been since you've stood up and employs the kids sitting behind you on a long flight method to encourage a stretch break this is a game to motivate exercise during a lockdown and this is a secret safe for your most valuable possessions and finally this is a g-dang lunchables assembly line are you kidding me and what do all of those have in common they were created by people who took my month-long creative engineering course i just launched this class for the first time a few months ago and it was so freaking rewarding to see what everybody learned and created as a result for the most part and because we got so much overwhelmingly positive feedback on the course we're doing it again you could sign up for it now this class covers my full engineering design process all the way from how i come up with an idea to prototyping to finalizing the build and giving it character i show you everything that i'm thinking everything that i'm doing and i do it three times over the course of a month you're gonna watch me design and create three totally original builds and i'm gonna guide you through finishing three creative builds of your own and this is an online class so you can take it from anywhere and work it around your schedule but it's fully immersive and intensive so whether you're a working professional or you're taking the class as a family whether you're a complete beginner or an experienced engineer this class has been designed to meet you where you're at and then level up

YeFzkC2awTM,Web Dev Simplified,Tech,JavaScript Shopping Cart Tutorial for Beginners,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeFzkC2awTM,3 years ago,598K views,Tech,hello everybody welcome to my video on how to code a shopping cart using only vanilla JavaScript on the right here we have the final project of what we're going to code in this video we have these items that we have a button to add them to our cart and down here we have our cart so if we click Add to Cart it'll add an item to our cart and update the total price increasing this quantity will also increase the price decrease and it will decrease the price and removing it will allow us to remove the item from the card we try to add a item to the cart multiple times it'll tell us that we've already added this item to our cart so we can't do it again and then if we click purchase down here they'll tell us thank you for the purchase and then remove all the items from our cart simulating a purchase so if you guys are just joining in on this video all of the code for creating the styles for this page as well as the HTML can be found in videos linked in the description or in the info cards in the corner so let's get started with actually coding of what we have here by opening up our store dot HTML page over here with live server to see what we have started to get working with so over here you see we have the shopping cart items as well as we have some items just templated endure a shock for now but none of these buttons actually do anything and change in these quantities doesn't update our total down here so we need to get started coding this with JavaScript in order to do this we need to create a new file in our project and we'll just call it store J S which stands for a JavaScript file so the dot J extension tells us that this is going to be a file with JavaScript in it then in order to include that file inside of our store dot HTML we need to go into our head and include a script tag here and give it a source attribute and this source attribute works exactly the same as href attribute for path or URL we add to it so we just say the path to are stored on a J's file here and then we end this tag and we do need an ending tag in our script tag unlike the link tag which is self closing and that's because you can actually put JavaScript inside of the script tags but it's always suggested to use a JavaScript file as opposed to JavaScript inside of a script tag similar to using a style element as opposed to an external CSS stylesheet so now if we save that our Styles from our JavaScript from our store dodgiest is now being loaded into our page but it's actually do anything because there's files empty in order to see these changes we can use console.log which will write anything that we put inside of here into the console of our web browser so if we just put here save that and then over on our browser if we right click and click on inspect we can now view the console so here you see if we wrote here to the console which means that we are actually running all the JavaScript inside of our store dodgiest we can change this to here to save it and now you see here to is output it to the console now before we get started I do want to make a note that in are stored out HTML we're loading our script tag inside of the head of our HTML and this means that our script tag will load before all of the content inside of our body in general things inside of the head will load in the background while the body of your page is being loaded but script tags are different in that while a script tag is being loaded nothing else on the page can continue loading in order to get around this and make our script tag load in the background we need to add the async attribute here which tells our browser in order to download this storage AS page in the background and continue downloading the actual body of our HTML page at the same time now let's jump into our storage AS page and start coding up the actual interactivity for our website so inside of here the very first thing that we're going to want to do is make these remove buttons here actually remove our item from our cart so the first thing we need to do is we need to select these remove buttons and then add an event to them to say when this is clicked do something so instead of our straw dot HTML if we scroll down to the section for our cart right here you see that we have this button danger class applied to all of our buttons so we want to select all of the buttons in our document that have this button danger class in order to do that we're going to use the document object which is an object that JavaScript gives to your page that essentially says this document object is everything inside of your HTML it has a bunch of methods on it for querying the different objects on your page as well as adding new objects to your page so we use this document object going to call the method on it which will allow us to query elements based on classes so we're gonna say give elements by a class name and all we do inside of here is we pass the class name we want to query for so in our case this is button danger and this method right here is going to return all of the different elements on our page that have the class but danger we're just going to save that to a variable and we'll say that these are the remove cart item buttons so now this variable remove cart item buttons stores all the different buttons with this exact class on it in order to see that we can log this variable right here to the console and if you say that we see that we now have inside of this array two different buttons and if I hover over them you see that they get highlighted inside of the actual browser you see the top one is highlighted and the bottom one is highlighted here which is perfect that's exactly what we want so now what we need to do is we need to add the exact event listeners to these in order to do something when we click on them to do this we need to loop through these different objects so we're going to use a for loop we'll save for variable I equals 0 so starting at 0 while I is going to be less than the length of the number of buttons we have so while I is less than the length the buttons we have and then we'll add 1 to I every single time instead of our loop so essentially all this code is saying is loop through all of the different buttons inside of our cart we'll create a variable here that will be the actual button so which call button will set it equal to whichever element in the loop that we are in because I will constantly be having one added to it each time we go through this array so we're going to select the il iment of this array set it to this button element here so now we can use button and since this button corresponds to one of our remove buttons over on the right here all we have to do is say button dot add event listener and this is how we add a listener to tell us when we click on a button do something so in our case we're going to listen for the click event and when the click event happens we want to run some code so we'll create a function for them and for now we're just gonna log to the console and we'll just say clicked and if we save that there we go click now when we click on a button you'll see that in the console it logs that we clicked and every time we click on it it'll block that and it would for both lower buttons so that's perfect that's exactly what we want now all we need to do is make it so this function will actually remove the cart item from our cart in order to do that we need to take our function here and this event listener always returns an event object inside of the function that it calls and this event object has a property on it called target so we can say event dot target and this target is essentially whatever button we clicked on so we'll just use our variable here and we'll say button clicked it's going to equal that so the button that we click is this event target and what we want to do is we want to get the cart row that buttons inside so if we go to our store here we have our button object here the parent of it is this object and then the parent of that object is the entire row which is what we want to remove from our cart so I'm deciding here we're gonna use button clicked and we want to get the parent element which is going to be this div right here that cart quantitative and then we want to get the parent of that in order to get the entire cart row so we send out parent element again and this is going to be the cart Road that we want to completely remove so we'll just use the remove function there we go and if we save that now when we click on this remove button it'll completely remove that item from the cart and there you go you see it's completely remove that item from the cart if we click this one it'll do the same thing but you'll notice our total here is not actually being updated so we need to write some code in order to update the total of our cart every time we remove an item from it in order to update the total of our cart let's create a brand new function down here we're just going to call it update cart total there we go and we can just call this function inside of our event listener for our button so we can say update cart total and now this will run all the code inside of this function when it's called so what we want to do in this update cart total function is we want to go through every single row in our cart we want to find the price and we want to multiply that by the quantity and then add that together for every single one of our rows and display it down here and our total so the first thing that we want to do is we want to get all of our cart rows and if we look over in our store dot HTML you'll see that all of our cart rows are inside of this cart items and they all have this cart row class so what we can do here is we can say we want to get our cart item container and this will be equal to the document dot get element by classman like I said and we want to get the elements that have the class name of cart item cart items sorry because that right here is what wraps all the rows inside of our cart but we only want to get the very first one of this cart items because this get elements by class name returns an array of elements and we only want one so we're just going to select the very first element inside of that array as our cart item container and then inside of that cart item container we wanted to use this same method of getting the elements by clasping and we want to get all the different cart row elements so elements that have the class cart row that are inside of this cart item container using this get elements by class main method on an actual object will only get the elements inside of that object that have this different class so then we can just set that to a variable we'll just say that this is our cart rows and now all we need to do is loop over all these different cart rows very similarly to how we looped over all the buttons up here so I'll just copy this code paste it down here and change this to be cart rows since we want to loop over our cart rows and then we'll just say create another variable here that'll be our cart row and we'll set that equal to whichever item we are inside of this array so whichever row that we're currently inside of this array is what this Cartwright 'm will be and then all we need to do is get the price and the quantity for the row of this cart so if we go back to our start at HTML you can see that our cart price is inside of this object with the class of cart price so what we're going to do is we're going to create another variable we'll call this one the price element and we'll set that equal to the cart row and we're going to get element by class name again and we want to use cart price here in order to get that element that contains the cart price and we just want the very first one again just like we used with the cart items and now we need to do the very next thing with the quantity and the quantity in here is this input element with the class of cart quantity input so we're going to do the very same thing to get a quantity element we're going to get it from the cart row where the element has the class name of cart quantity input and again we only want the very first one so we'll just use that and now we have our price element and our quantity element and if we log these out to the console so we have a price element and a quantity element if we save that and now when we remove an element it'll tell us oh here's our span for our price right here and here's the input and if we hover over them you'll see that is returned all of the different priced elements and quantity elements inside of the row which is exactly what we want so now all we need to do is get the actual information from these elements because currently we have the element and not the information inside of it so we want to do is we want to get the price from the price element so we'll say price and we're going to set that equal to the price element and what we're going to do is get the inner text from that element the inner text we'll just get whatever text is inside of that element so we can do here as will do another log to see what this is actually returning and when we click this remove button you'll see that it's returning this 999 which is the text inside of this price column which is exactly what we want but you'll notice this 999 has a dollar sign in the beginning and we want this to be a number without the dollar sign so what we need to do is we need to just do a replace on this we want to replace all the dollar signs inside of this string and we were on place them with absolutely nothing so those will just completely remove the dollar sign from our string and then since we want this to be a number and not a string we need to use the parse float method which will turn any string into a float which is essentially a number with decimal points after it there we go and now please save that and do this remove again you'll see we now have 999 as a number without the dollar sign which is exactly what we need in order to do math on this number the last step is to get the quantity from our quantity element so we're going to say quantity equals the quantity element and we want to get the value of the quantity element since this is an input element right here you need to get the value property of it and not the in there text because inputs do not have any text inside them they have a value so we want to get the value here which is going to correspond with this quantity number and now we can just say price times quantity and we can blog that so now if we click remove here you see we get 1998 which is this price times this quantity and that's perfect now the very last thing we have to do is set this value to whatever we get for the price and quantity and since this is inside of a loop we need to total all of these together so before our loop let's create a variable we'll call it total and we're going to set this to zero to start with and then we want to add so total is going to equal total plus the price times the quantity and it'll do that every time it goes to the loop it'll add the previous total to the price times quantity of that row to give us the new total and then after our loop at the very end here we want to actually get the element with the card total price so if we go over to our store here you'll see that we have this cart total price class which is where this price comes from so we'll just do document dot get elements by class name give it that class our total price again we only want the very first one and then we want to do is we want to set the inner text of this element so we do inner text and we're going to set it equal to the total and now if we save that and we click remove you see that our total is updated to the actual quantity times price of everything inside of here but you'll notice there's no dollar sign so what we can do in here as we can use the dollar sign and then combine that with our total and now if we save that and remove you'll see that now our total updates and is displayed correctly with a dollar sign in front of it now before we go further with actually creating the rest of our buttons I do want to make note of one thing that is particular with JavaScript that we need to make sure of before we actually start trying to access the different elements on our page we need to make sure that our page is done loading if you remember when we added this script tag we added this async method here which tells it that it'll load in the background while the body of our element is loading but if the body of our page loads after the JavaScript loads our JavaScript will run here but there's no body for it to run off of which means it won't be able to find any of these different elements since they haven't been generated yet so in order to check to see if the page is done loading we need to go to the very top of our javascript file here and we need to add an if statement to check to see if the document and we're going to check the ready state to see if it is still loading so if the document is still loading which is what this if statement is same what we want to do is we want to add an event listener to our document very similarly to how we add in an event listener to our button and we want to listen for the event Dom content loaded and you have to make sure that you have the capitalization correct for all of these different letters in order for this to work and this event will fire as soon as the page is done loading so inside of here we just want to run a function and we'll just call that function ready and then if our page is already loaded so if the page is loading it'll run the code in here but if it's not loading so if it's already done loading we just want to run that ready function no matter what and then we can create that function will call it ready here and inside of this function will do all the code for hooking up our buttons right here and that way our code for hooking up the buttons will automatically work even if the page isn't already loaded because it'll just wait for this event of the Dom content loaded before it actually calls the ready function so now we know everything inside of here the page is already loaded when the code gets to this point another thing we can do is we can clean up our code a little bit by creating a function and we'll just call this function here we'll call it remove cart item and this function will take all the code that is inside of our event listener here for removing a cart button we'll add the event object in here and inside of our click right here we'll just put remove cart item so now instead of having all the code for our function inside of the event listener here we're able to move it out here so it's easier to tell what's going on in our code and easier to read and if we reload the page you'll see that everything still works as before the next thing that we can work on is making it so that when we changed the value inside of the quantity here that it will actually update our total because as you see if I increase this number our total stays the same and we can also input numbers below below zero which we do not want to be able to do because we don't want someone to order negative 14 t-shirts so what we're going to do is we're going to do something very similar to what we did with our card buttons here but we're going to do it for our quantity input so let's go back to our store dot HTML page scroll down to our cart you'll see we have this card quantity input class on our input which we can use to select those elements so we'll create another variable we'll call it our quantity inputs and we'll set it equal to the document dot get elements by class name for that classman and then we'll just loop over them again just like we did with the remove Cart button so I'll copy that and use quantity inputs instead of our removal buttons and then in here we'll set a variable input equal to whichever iteration of the loop that we are on will get that element from the array so now this is going to be each one of our inputs that we are going to have for our quantity inputs right here and now all we need to do just take that input we need to add an event listener and inside of here we want to add the event listener change in order to listen to any time the input changes its value and then we're going to call a function and we'll just call it quantity changed there you go and now let's create that function down here so we have a function quantity changed and it'll take that event variable that we talked about earlier and there we go now we can actually code up what we want to do when our quantity has changed so the first thing we need to do is get that quantity element so we're just going to get that input here and we're going to set it to event dot target since we know that the target of our event is going to be the actual input element that we need and then we want to check to see if the value inside of this input is a valid value so the first thing we want to check for is we want to check for if it's actually a number because if the person deletes it and clicks off this is no longer number so we can use the function is n a n which stands for is not a number and we can pass in our input dot value in here and this will check to see if our input is a number or if it's not a number and we also want to make sure that our number is not a negative number we want to make sure that it is 1 or higher because we always want people to order at least one of something you can't order zero or negative one of anything so we can check to see if it's not a number or if the input value is less than or equal to zero which means that they either put zero negative one negative two anything less than 1 inside of here what we want to do is we want to set our quantity or our input value we want to set it to 1 since 1 is the lowest possible number we want somebody to be able to purchase an item of and then all we need to do after that is update the total inside of our car since we already created this function we don't actually need to do anything other than call it and now when we save that if we increment this value to two for example you'll see that our total increases if we increment it to three you'll notice our total increases again for five and so on but you'll also notice that our price here gets a little bit messed up it has a ton of nines at the end here and we don't actually want that this is because in computers they can't do division or multiplication or addition with floating-point numbers so pawn numbers with decimal points 100% accurately so sometimes they get rounding errors where you'll get a bunch of nines or a bunch of zeros and a one saying that it didn't quite round out exactly right so what we want to do instead of our update card total function is we always want to round to two decimal places so in order to do this we're going to take our total variable here and we're going to set it equal to our total variable again but we want to round it this will use the map that round function which will round to the nearest whole number but since we want to round to two decimal places well first multiply our total by 100 which will move our two numbers after our decimal place in front of the decimal place we'll around it and then we will divide by 100 and this will essentially round our total to the nearest two decimal places and if we save that now when we increment this total our quantity you'll notice our total never actually goes beyond two decimal places even if there's a little bit of a rounding error you'll also notice that if I try to lower this number below one and click off it'll always change back to one for example if I do negative one here it'll be back to one if I put in zero back to one and even if I completely delete it and click off it'll change back to one this is exactly what we want this means that our users will never be able to order less than one of an item that's in the cart and if they want to remove it from the cart all they have to do is click the remove button and would be removed for them now the next button that we have to hook up is just Add to Cart button that all of our different cart items have the first thing we need to do in order to accomplish this is the very same thing that we needed to do for our quantity inputs and a remove cart item button we need to go up we need to find where this button is so right here we have shop item button is a class we apply it to all of our different Add to Cart buttons so down here we're just going to create a variable which is our Add to Cart buttons we're going to set that variable equal to the document get elements for the class name of the shop item button and then we're going to do another loop over these objects so we'll just copy this loop from up here we're going to replace quantity inputs with the Add to Cart buttons since we want to loop over these buttons for adding to cart we're going to get the actual button so we'll say the button is equal to Add to Cart buttons the ID element since that'll be whichever element of the for loop that we are on and then the last thing we need to do is we need to add the actual event to the button so let's say a button that add event listener we want to do click again since we want to do something when we click on the button and then we need to give it a function name and we're just going to create a function called add to cart clicked and there we go now let's create that function down here say function add to cart clicked it'll take that event parameter and then we can do again create the sexual button so we'll say the button here is going to be equal to even top target and this is our Add to Cart button now so now if we scroll down to a cart we can see that there is a few elements we need to add to our cart we need to add an image we need at a name of the item the price of the item and then the quantity and foot as well as the removal button this quantity input is always going to be 1 and this remove button is always going to be just to remove button so really all we need to do is get the price name an image from our actual item so if we go back to our HTML here and we find a shop item we can see that our Add to Cart button is inside this details div and then our actual shop item is the div right above it so what we need to do in order to get our sharp item as we say shop item we're going to set that to our button and we're going to get the parent of the button and the parent of the buttons parent and that will be this shop item div right here and from here we can query the item inside the shop item did to get this shop item title for example so if we go back here we can say that the title is going to equal to this shop item we're going to get two elements by class then with the class name of shop item title and again we just want the very first one and we want the text inside that so we use inner text and if we do a console dot log here of the title save that and we click Add to Cart you'll see we get coffee cup for the coffee cup get t-shirt when click the t-shirt button and so on for all of our different buttons so now what we want to do is we want to get the price next if we look here we have the shop item price class which we can query on so we can say that the price is going to be equal to shop item get elements by a class for the shop item price class again get the first element and get the text inside of it and now if we log the price and the title to see there the coffee cup 699 this t-shirt $19.99 and so on now the very last thing we need to do is we need to get our image element and all we want to do is get the source of our image so one side of our store here we see that our image has the class shop item image so if we do the very same thing again we can say that the image source is going to be equal to shop item get the elements with the class name shop item image get the very first one and instead of the text inside of this image since images don't have text we want to get the source attribute and this attribute is going to be the source that we applied to our different image so now if we print this out here we say image source click the Add to Cart button you'll see that we get the URL that goes towards the source of our image which is exactly what we want and it's going to be different for all of our different images as you can see so now what we need to do is we need to actually add a row to our cart down here and this is going to be the most complex part of what we're going to do so I'm going to create a separate method to do this and we'll call this the add item to cart method and we're going to pass in the title the price and the image source into this function I'll just create this function down here add item to cart and it's going to take the parameters title price and image source just like that and now we need to do is we need to create a row for our cart item in order to create this cart row we'll just create a variable called cart row and we need to set it to a new elements we're going to use document dot create element which allows us to create an element of any type that we want so for example we just want to create a div so if we run this document create element it's going to create a brand new div it's not going to add it to our HTML yet but we have a div that we can now later add to our HTML and we want to add it to our cart items as you can see here we scroll down we have a cart items which is where all of our cart rows are going to be so we want to add that to our cart items so we're gonna find the cart items which is going to be equal to the document we're going to get elements by class name for cart items and we're just going to get the very first one and then we're just going to use the append method for this cart items so we say pend which is going to add this cart row to the very end of our cart items so we can just say cart row here and now this append method will append our cart row to the end of our cart items which is exactly what we want it's just going to add an empty div though for now so if we click this Add to Cart button we're adding emptied is which have nothing in them but if we wanted to add something into these divs just to see what it looks like we can say cart row inner text equals title and now when we click this add to cart button you'll see we add a coffee cup here if we click the t-shirt one we added a row a t-shirt and so on and now all we need to do is do the actual styling add the image and add the price etc so we get our cart row looking exactly like our other cart rows and the easiest way for us to do that is to just take the HTML directly from our store page here so we'll just copy everything that's inside of our cart row and we're going to actually use that HTML generate a cart run so we'll just say that our cart row contents variable we're going to set it equal to a string but we're going to use back ticks around the string instead of quotation marks so we can use our string on multiple different lines so now if we paste this in here fix our space in real quick there you go you'll see that we have all of the different HTML that we need to create our cart contents so now instead of setting the title here what we want to do is we want to set the cart row inner HTML we're going to set it to our cart row contents and the reason we use inner HTML is because we're actually using HTML tags inside of this instead of just text and now we save this click Add to Cart you see that we added a new item to our cart which is perfect but you'll notice that it's actually not styled just like this and that's because we need to add the class of cart row to our cart row here so we can just say cart row dot class list dot add and we'll just add the class of cart Road save that and now when we click Add to Cart you'll notice that add something to the cart but you'll notice it always adds the t-shirt item and that's because we're not using the variables we pass into this function since we used back ticks here we can actually just put variables directly into our code so for example our image URL if we put a dollar sign and then a curly bracket anything inside of that is going to be a variable that will evaluate so we'll say the image source so now it'll take our image source variable and put it right here inside of this HTML we can do the same thing for the title down here so we'll save title and then lastly we can do the same thing for our price right here and now if we save them we click Add to Cart you'll see that it now adds all these elements correctly to the cart like we want to let me click Add to Cart again you'll notice that actually add two coffee cups to our cart which we don't want to do so what we want to do is we want to make a check to check to see if we already have the coffee cup inside of our cart before adding it to our car in order to do that we're going to get all the names of our card items from our part so we'll just say cart item names we're gonna set that equal to carte items dot get element by class man and if we check to see what our class name is in here we'll notice that it is cart item title right here will be the name of our cart item so we can just get by a car item title and then we can loop through all these different card items so let's say while I starts at 0 I is less than carte items length and then we add one to I every time we go through the loop and then we can just say that our cart item names so we check if cart item names we want to get the ith element or whatever iteration wrong we want to check the inner text because the inner text will either be t-shirt in this example album three depends on whatever rover on and we want to check is the text inside of that cart row equal to the title that we passed in right here and if it's equal to the title that means that we've already added that item to our cart so we want to just alert the user with the alert function and the alert function will pop up a pop-up for the user telling them that something has happened and they can click OK to dismiss the pop-up so we'll just say that this item is already added to the cart there we go and then we also want to return from our function since we no longer want to execute the code below this for loop and calling return will immediately exit you out of the function and stop executing anything below it so call and return here will bring us back to where we called that ID item to cart function so now if we save that we add a coffee cup you'll see it adds it perfectly down here and if we try to add another coffee cup we're going to get a message thing that the item has already been added to the cart and you'll notice it does not add another one to the cart which is perfect you will notice however that our total down here is not being updated so well in our Add to Cart clicked button event right here we'll just put our update cart total function right there and now if when we add a coffee cup you notice that our total updates correspondingly with our coffee cup items one thing that you will realize though is if we go to use the remove button on our newly added item you'll notice our remove button does not work and you'll think why does that not work we added all of our event listener up here when our document loaded but we only added these event listeners as soon as our document loaded and this remove button was not here when the document loaded this was added after we loaded the document so we need to add an event listener to this remove button so inside of our function here after we add our contents to the document we're going to select them will say cart row we're going to get the elements by clasping and we're going to do it for the button danger which is a remove button we want to get the very first one and we'll add an event listener here for click just like we did above when the document was loaded and we'll use our function for removing a cart item now if you save that if we add this coffee cup and then we click the remove button you'll not notice that remove button works we now need to do the same thing for our quantity since as you can see our quantity input does not work it does not update the total so we'll just do the exact same thing with the cart row we'll get elements by classmen and in this case it's the cart quantity input get the very first one here add the event listener and this time the event listener is a change event listener instead of the click now we'll just use our quantity changed function and now when we added something to the cart these two lines will be run which add our event listeners to our new quantity input and our new remove input so now when we update our quantity input our total will update and our remove button will now remove the item from our cart this is exactly what we need but what we should do is remove these elements from our HTML since we don't want our cart to already have items in it as soon as the page loads so we'll go into our store here and remove all of our cart rows inside of our cart items now if we save that you see that our cart is completely empty oh we should update our price here as well to start at $0 and now you'll see that our cart is completely empty when I page loads and we can add items to our cart increase the quantity of those items maybe add a different item to the cart and you'll see that this adds up perfectly total right here is perfect you can remove things as we need to remove it back to zero whatever we need now the very last thing we have to do is to make the purchase button actually remove all the items from our cart so let's start to do that now inside of our ready function here we're going to do the exact same thing we've done for all of our other buttons and we're going to add an event listener so let's check what class we need to query on we want to look for this button purchase class and that is the class that we applied to our button so in here we're going to do document dot get elements by class name we're going to use that class name of button purchase there's only one button for purchasing on our entire page so we just want to get the first one and we're gonna add the event listener to this it's going to be a click event listener and we're going to make a function and we'll just call it purchase clicked just like that and down here you can add that function purchase clicked there we go and all we want to do inside of this function is alert the user that they have purchased these items so I'll create an alert and inside of this alert will just say thank you for your purchase this will just notify them that they have purchased these items and then we will go down here and we will delete all the items inside of our cart so in order to do this what we want to do is we want to select the container our cart items are in which is this cart items class right here we know that all of our cart rows are going to be added to this so we will say cart items as a variable it's going to be equal to the document we're going to get all the elements by class then of cart items we know there's only one so we're just going to get the first one and then we're gonna want to loop over all the children inside of the cart so if we add a bunch of things in the cart you see that we're gonna have multiple cart rows in here so we want to check for all the children inside this cart items so we'll say while which is similar to a for-loop but it will continue to execute as long as whatever is inside the parenthesis here is true so we'll say while our cart items has children so has child note which essentially means is there any children inside of this cart Adam if that is true we're going to take the cart item we're going to remove the child and we're just going to remove whatever the very first child inside of cart items is and we can use the first child property to get that so this while loop will continually loop through all of the I rows in our cart items and remove them from our cart items until our cart items is completely empty so let's test this out let's add some things to our cart here we'll increase the quantity here so we have 67 dollars worth of purchases to make if we click purchase it'll say thank you for your purchase and we would click OK you'll see everything our cart is removed but our total still hasn't been updated so again we're just going to call our update cart total function at the end of here and now we add some things to our cart look at our total 2698 purchase after we click OK our total goes back to zero and that's all there is to creating the JavaScript for this page it may seem like a lot of code we have a lot of lines in here but a lot of this is just doing the same thing over and over again as you can see we have get elements by class name being called all the time to get the elements that we want to apply our events to as well as to get the elements that we want to get the text from in order to create our rows or remove our rows really the main takeaways from here is up here we have the code that is going to check to make sure that our document is loaded before we try to access the different parts of it this is incredibly important to have in every single bit of JavaScript that you work on then next we set up all of our event listeners for all of the items that are already loaded into our document at the very beginning of our document load then we have our different events that are going to do different things such as add elements to the cart remove elements from the cart update the quantity and so on and then lastly when we add new elements to our document we need make sure to hook up all of our event listeners to those documents elements because they weren't around when we set up our initial events up here in our ready function because they were added after this ready function was called this is a very important step to add these event listeners that has commonly forgotten when creating new elements in JavaScript other than that though there really isn't much complicated code in this project and really not much JavaScript specific code all we're really doing is getting the different elements and then pasting those elements inside of our cart and then removing them with this purchase button or the remove button so now if I make this a little bit larger here remove this console down here you can see we can add our different items to our cart change our quantity as high as we want we try to make it a negative number it'll change it back to one maybe we don't want a coffee cup remove it and then we're done purchase our items and there we go this is everything that we need in order to create the fully functioning cart on our band website so thank you guys very much for watching this video I hope you guys learned something about the JavaScript that you need to use in order to create this cart from just plain vanilla JavaScript if you guys want to see the code that I have for either the actual band web pages or the cart itself go over to my github which is linked in the description below for all of the code that we worked on in this lesson thank you guys very much for sitting through this extremely long video on JavaScript if you guys enjoyed it please don't forget to leave me a like and subscribe if you want to see similar content and let me know down in the comments below what you want me to cover more in depth related to JavaScript in the future thank you guys very much have a good day,43:55
HgFzP5m1k_c,Let's Game It Out,VideoGames,I Turned Valheim Into a Physics-Defying Nightmare,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgFzP5m1k_c,10 months ago,9.1M views,VideoGames,hey there it's josh welcome back to let's game it out we're checking out valheim today a fun romp in viking times where nothing can possibly go wrong oh and before we jump into this did you know that i started streaming if you didn't here's what you're missing out on all right let's get out i wonder if i wonder if the flip feature is ready to be used now wow how about that huh so if you want to check that out link to my twitch is in the description but for now it's viking o'clock first things first we gotta make a character there are various different types of hairstyles we can choose from not to mention a bunch of very exciting beards my favorite being long one which once added just flies into existence but we're actually gonna go no beard and for hair we're gonna go with this one you know who this kind of looks like like if we make the hair a little darker and a little less blonde oh i know who that is johnny hot body oh what the game puts him in a shirt we'll have to remedy that but at least they didn't put you in any pants like a true viking and let's see what are we going to name our new world well that one's obvious we can also change the seed which is what determines the way the world auto-generates so we're going to delete that seed and replace it with absville and see what kind of world that brings us ah this is how i like my viking stories to begin on a pleasure cruise in the skies holding a pose like i just got struck by lightning flying through the air by a giant bird hitting every branch we can on the way down and then unceremoniously dropping me off wow the weather sure changes quickly around here except for me of course my body still appears to be crying what if i take this off rag tunic better than nothing i beg to differ ah there we go much better ah hey valheim you've betrayed me already come here grayling nobody hits johnny hot body well i guess we don't need to talk about combat very much you just saw what it looks like thank god that thing exploded into resin anyway so here's the wild world of valheim you might be wondering what all this stuff is and we'll get to it but first let's explore the world so we've got land we've got ocean we got coastlines we got bad guys and ah and also respawning thank god something tells me we're gonna need it my god is there anything in this world that doesn't want to kill you so first things first is we need to set up a base ah this grassy field will do look at this plenty of room to spread out and like any good survival crafting game i bet you know how this starts and it's with punching trees for wood so we'll just start with all the little ones here we're also gonna need some stones like these ones here on the ground and surely i can punch this with my bare hands right nope looks like i'm not doing any damage to it but luckily since i've gathered some wood and stone over here we can do ourselves a little basic crafting we're gonna start by crafting a stone axe a crude axe for tree filling and fell some trees we will this dead tree is no match for me now yeah take that nature johnny hop body one natured ah well now we know well that'll learn me thank god my stuff is all still here just sitting atop the murder log come here you give me my stuff back okay i think we've got enough wood for now because now we're gonna make a hammer with this to your hand you can raise high halls and mighty fortifications well then let's get to the crafting what the game means of course is that with a hammer you can build all kinds of stuff but first things first we got to make a workbench which i don't know i guess we'll just build right here look at this we unlocked all these things so we can build homes and stuff now let's get started and use that craft bit crafting station needs a roof well thankfully we've got all these beautiful building options now you know like roof tiles and ladder tiles and wall tiles so the game said it wanted a roof right i'm gonna assume that this is what they meant look you say you want a roof i'll give you a roof now it's time to craft station is too exposed too exposed what do you mean like from the elements what are you shy okay so be it i'll build you a little shelter but we're not gonna make it look nice we will use every random piece of wall we can though how about this beauty is this good enough for you ah looks like it worked and you can tell we're crafting from the workbench because it says workbench look at this we can make arrows we can make hoes clothes i'm never gonna wear weapons i'm never gonna use now that we got that squared away we got something else we have to build and that's a bed let's see where should we put this can i put it up here of course i can can't wait to sleep outdoors in this absolutely improbable bed oh but first i have to claim it bed needs a roof oh god you too what is it with everything needing rooves and stuff all right here you go it's kind of like a lean tube that is to expose what do you think about this for being too exposed oh god you didn't like that at all did it okay i got a different idea then surely nothing could go wrong here right so first we'll build a little step ladder all the way up to the top of the tree here surely there's a place we can put this bed right done a lovely tree bed now of course the bed still needs a roof and i can't really see what i'm doing but i think i'll somehow be able to make this work that is too exposed okay cool we're halfway there so all we need to do is encompass the thing and i have an idea for that too but first we gotta chop more wood like a lot more wood like a lot a lot more wood like a lot a lot of oh hey didn't see you there me i was just doing some light chopping no big deal and these trees over here can thank their lucky stars because they're too strong for my axe anyway all i need to do now is chop these smaller pieces and voila lovely piles of wood yep it's a start it's not all the wood but i don't want to waste time doing that i need to waste that time somewhere else so before we do some hot building let's explain how building works basically integrity is represented with four colors blue means it's very stable and connected to the ground green means it's stable and not connected to the ground and if we keep building stuff out from here yellow means we're getting unstable and red means we're about to fall over observe no likey so if you want to make sure these structures are sound you got to give it adequate support so something tells me we can apply that to here too because here's something i realized if you take these roof tiles and just connect them to the tree like this they're technically blue i guess it considers the tree stable so give me a second here because i've got an idea yeah something a little more like that so i tried to make it look a little like a tornado and this is about as good as it's gonna get before the structural integrity kind of eats itself but let's take a gander shall we here's the only way in or out you'll notice this step ladder is not actually connected that's because everything here is supported only by the tree starts out looking nice and stable and slowly gets worse as you look higher and higher but hey it's hard to argue with results it is standing after all so here we have the upper level where you can look out and survey all that is yours and we do have a lower deck so watch your eyes and watch your step i like to call this cramped space the bungalow we're also going to put our bed down here opposed to where we had it before bed needs a roof really are all these roof tiles just not doing it for you what if i just put another bed on top of that bed still no good huh i'm gonna assume this is happening because these tiles up here are actually floor tiles and not roof tiles i'm kind of curious though if i can place myself right above where the bed is i think this is probably about it and i just put a roof tile like this up here okay let's give it a shot ah now that bed belongs to johnny hot body you know while we're here let's gussy up the place who's up for some indoor torches i know i am i don't know why you can put these actually on the bed but i'm not gonna complain about it can't wait to sleep the sleep at king's later but now the more important part is when i go and do one of these when i respawn back in it'll be in my bed this time like it was all a dream a very bright warm dream now that that's squared away the next thing we're gonna do is focus on the next amazing tool in our arsenal and that would be this the ho farmers tool for working the earth oh but believe you me it can do so much more than that for example you can level the ground which looks a little something like this there's only one thing that would stop me from doing this everywhere and it's that it takes stamina and your stamina runs out kind of quickly oh you know what else it can do raise the ground you know kind of like this with the helping of this and a little more of this it comes at a hefty cost though it takes four stones every time you want to use this what i'm trying to say is just to raise this as high as i have right now i just use up an entire pile of stone and believe it or not stone is hard to just find on the ground because we can't pick up these big ones just yet so until we can get more stone whoops curse these fragile bones anyway we'll get some stone eventually until then we're going to do some ground leveling experiments you might see here that while it levels the ground it's also kind of terraforming a little bit you know because some ground is higher than other ground so i kind of wonder if this works the other way around if i level up here can i raise the average ground height it seems so cause i'm slowly burying this log well if that works here like this will that work over there in the ocean well let's find out shall we so we can't level this because this isn't technically ground but we can level this and at least so far it is definitely extending okay so it kind of works but it gets really finicky even with all the time and patience in the world i'm not sure it's going to allow us to get all the way across there's also a third option for creating paths but that doesn't really seem like it's gonna do the trick either so that just leaves one option raising the ground it has two requirements we need to fulfill which is the four stone as well as having a workbench nearby the workbench is easy enough we can put that just about anywhere stone on the other hand is a little bit harder to come by the reason is because the only ones we can pick up are the loose ones like this these we can pick up by hand but the real magic are all these boulders and stuff but this is a foe for which we don't have the tools yet don't worry though we can get them and the key to that are these guys right here that's right little guy you don't know it yet but johnny hot body's coming for you here let me show you why by the way remember this old thing well now it plays a crucial role see each one of these little rocks with the hooks on it represents a boss we need to kill so it starts with the old dear god person here and then it moves on to slenderman before you then have to fight blabula and then this dragon in a state of perpetual ecstasy and then finally whatever this is we'll just call it skeletor but we're getting ahead of ourselves the only thing we need to worry about is this one so if we come over here and activate this little stone excuse me register the location like we're at the dmv it not only pulls up our map but it gives us the location of the bus erythritol or whatever it says unfortunately it's not as easy as just going over here and fighting the boss we have to summon it on this altar and in order to do that we need to offer it an item what item you might wonder well i'm glad you asked cause that's what this viking tool tip is for hunt his kin i think we know what this means right it's time to die come here you here comes johnny hot body what are you running for come here i'm uh yo you'll be back okay easy there now is our time to shine you're mine you'll be back okay you know what i got another idea one of the things we can make anywhere is a campfire i wonder if we can sneak up on one of these and set them on fire okay this is gonna work this is totally gonna work yes run for me yes well i guess that answers that question you sure can this is the best way to fight it's just put down a campfire in its way run that way now yeah in fact why don't i attack everything this way this is working great okay so i just killed a deer here and it has the item we're looking for which is this deer trophy it's actually the second one i collected which is good because we're gonna need two of them quickly back to the circle of stones so with these in hand we can go ahead and put them on the altar and then something wild's gonna happen so let's take our deer masks and feed it to the altar you make a sacrifice huh what do you suppose is happening over there pretty sure the sky turning red is only for good things yup only good things like chasing me around trying to hit me with lightning hashtag just erythritol things the only question i have now is how do you feel about campfire now that said as i'm dying i couldn't help but notice i did set him on fire quickly johnny hot body back to the fight we must see if we can lure him into a trap this time the trap is called keeping him on fire until his health depletes oh so slowly how is this working how am i running around just keeping him on fire oh we're getting there oh we're getting there oh we're almost there so close bye buddy well how about that huh there we go a trophy of their head what we actually want though is this a hard antler oh but we do take the trophy and put it on this thing here like so ta-da and besides looking majestic that does also get us something else jump and run more oh boy quickly back to the homestead wow the weather sure cleared up fast so we got these things right which means we can make this antler pickaxe this tool is hard enough to crack even the most stubborn rocks so i bet you know where this is going if not well i'm about to show you see all these fierce rocks i couldn't do anything about before well now i can do plenty about them and he gives me all kinds of glorious stone not just that by the way you want to know what else you can do that's right you can modify the terrain so you're probably wondering how far down we can go about this far unfortunately we're not allowed to dig down as far as we want that's okay there's still plenty of pick accent to do and look at all the amazing stone it gives us not to mention the horrible things you can do to the landscape but before we go through all this trouble digging up all of this stone let's see if this does what we hope it'll do we got a whole bunch of stone on us and we got our hoe and we're clearly ready to use it it's time to raise some ground looks like it does the trick yep seems like this is gonna work but as you can see we run out of stone real quick ah well i think you know what time it is it's pickaxe time don't wait up i'll be just a second [Music] okay and great feeling pretty good about the work i've done here feeling really good about it feeling really really good about it i like this monster right here just like yep another incredibly confusing day at the office i wish i could tell you how long i'd been doing this but honestly i lost track a lifetime ago the important part is that we did some really good work here today and by that i mean we have a whole lot of stones now with each one of these piles representing 50 stones each is it gonna be enough i don't know but i think i know how we can find out come here delicious stone let's get started oh you know what this might not be as hard as i thought it would be i thought i was gonna have to pull it up from the ground right there but i can actually just place it along the edge there for just four stone this is gonna be easy ta-da job's done admittedly i also got a little carried away but you'll be happy to know you can build a bridge all the way from one side to another and if you have extra stones as i did you can even build alternate pathways and as an added bonus nature has no idea what to do about this oh how i love to confuse wildlife now let's see what rat do we want to take do we want to go the low route or the up high route oh let's go low route after all it seems so risky with our feet touching the water a little bit i should point out there's actually boats in this game but why sail when you can swagger oh boy i'm just so excited i bet there's an adventure around every corner or in this case as it turns out behind me do you have business with the hot body speaking of hot bodies how do you do with fire not good it looks like well here help yourself seems like it's working out pretty well stand fast johnny hot body there appears to be a foe in the distance we must tread carefully and by that i mean let's run right up to him see if he's flammable answer yes so very flammable come on buddy it's okay there's only a couple of campfires between the two of us yep that'll teach ya well that worked out great and the smoke is ruining my frame rate everybody wins huh wait what's this over here this looks a little unnatural and it turns out it is this must be what the big blue guy was guarding well we should probably go inside but first let us prepare the area you never know where there's hidden treasure hey funny story as it turns out did you know you can dig underneath these things like all the way underneath it's true these caves are basically spaceships i like how these deer over here are like what the hell are we looking at well let's hope we can still get in here oh thank goodness eat enter in we go oh it was a troll cave well that's okay johnny hot body is always ready to fight oh maybe that one outside was the only one well so be it i'll just take your precious rubies and then leave you a nice surprise for if you ever come back that's some fine work jhb surely there's adequate ventilation for all this smoke well i think my work here is done now that i've covered every inch in campfires hopefully there's another troll out there waiting to come home to a big nice surprise come johnny hot body let us ah what is this karma well i assure you it's gonna take more than that to stop us now that we've desecrated this onward to another adventure oh and what might this be looks to be another cave entrance well we know the drill no free entry not to any cave not for me not for anyone okay much better mysterious ufo verified now let's position ourselves right underneath it and then raise the ground until it forces us into the loading screen ah burial chambers very exciting quickly johnny ready the only weapon you're gonna need the campfire let's see what dastardly things await us in here spoiler it's all flammable stuff thus everything is no match until eventually we find a room like this one hello am i interrupting something important here have a campfire i think we finally found something i can't destroy with campfires well for everything else there's punching a lot i didn't realize dungeon crawling could be so easy and then we come across rooms like this one with treasures like coins and these core thingies and here's the greatest treasure of them all registering veggie might the elder at the dmv yep there they are there's us well that was fun now that we've got what we came for it's time to get out of here and immediately fall to our death as is our custom and then onward the veggie tails the elder [Music] welp and here we are somehow i thought this would be harder to get to but i really did just run here well before we get any closer gotta do that thing we do that thing i lovingly call the reason we can't have nice things yep that'll do it just like the other one it floats in the air although this one's got this little thing huh maybe the fire's gas powered or something anyway let's get to summoning this boss oh right just like last time we gotta offer something up well let's see what the old tool tip has to say burn their young what just any young i can do that actually i think what the game means is this right over here not sure what it is but if we can punch it or set it on fire we're gonna be fine that and i kind of recognized this star looking thing back over at the altar thing they were on the columns well here goes nothing go go gadget campfire yep this is working out just fine somehow that'll do it and another one you know the drill oh johnny hot body is there anything your fist can't do and then after beating up on a whole bunch of those for a while we've got a bunch of these ancient seeds okay here we are now seeds in hand ready to summon veggie tails the elder huh i wonder where he's gonna spawn ah there he is well you look like a fun chap what's your special power do you do like hot forest stuff ah you know in hindsight i don't know what i was expecting okay round two i see you back there yeah that's a cute trick but i'm not gonna fall for it by moving i can't believe that actually worked you know i'm kind of wondering something while i cower behind this rock is he stuck right there because he does seem a little bit wedged into the side like that wait can i just go underneath and beat him up from down here there's no way this is gonna work right oh my god it totally is and he's just completely stuck all i need to do is punch him in the leg over and over and over again i like how all these vines just keep appearing near me like ah stop wait what's happening here ah okay let's try to be a little more careful this time oh we're also technically in good hands down here look at this we have a resting buff a fire buff you know because that fire is right above us wait can i just build like a little bed in a home down here okay we'll just put the bed right here oh my god it just said it as a spawn point can i go to bed too okay so you can't go to bed because there's enemies nearby supposedly but at least now we can spawn here look at that it's got a roof and everything this is amazing okay well where was i wait a minute can i build a campfire under him oh my god this is even easier i don't even have to punch him he's just perpetually on fire i guess all i have to do is wait out his health bar as he very slowly but surely burns to death and good night sweet prince ah yes the death pose of a valiant foe and my prize an elder trophy and whatever this is a swamp key wow how could i ever get so lucky now before we head back i had one other thought so when we summoned that guy the first time we had 11 seeds and now we only have eight so my question is can i summon him again that seems to be a big ol yes wait can i do it again too oh boy oh boy huh what was all that up there uh so yes it turns out you can summon more than one well i think we know where this is going guys just stay right there okay i'll be right back i need to go get some more of those seeds hi i'm back how are you doing oh are we a little grouchy i'll just take the long way around yeah don't worry don't get up on account of me that was a close one well now that i've got all these seeds the real question is how am i gonna put him in this altar you know with these guys stomping around let's see can i just like jump up and push it that appears to be a no maybe if i stand directly under this thing and then i try to raise myself straight up into it well this is certainly doing something isn't it raise it a little more oh too close too close i appear to be on fire ah johnny hot body no oh johnny you know maybe i'm overthinking this let's try building just to the side of it this time maybe this will do the trick well i haven't been able to get to the altar yet but i have this weird feeling that the bad guys know i'm here now couldn't explain what it is it's just a feeling but if i just keep jumping will that help oh oh ah screw it let's just do it the old-fashioned way horribly and dangerously one at a time and just try not to get killed as each new one comes in just gotta make sure to hide from everything hello new gods i would like to make a sacrifice okay bye jeez so cranky up there you know it's weird but the more gods that are over there the harder this gets and even though we don't prevail a lot of the time so help me god we're gonna do it welp i did it it took a million deaths in half my lifetime but we did it most of them are like this guy over here which is to say stuck but then we've got some other guys over here that are not only stuck but have become best buds and then we've got these two which appear to be still kind of sorting out their differences overall though it's like strangely wholesome as for us well i haven't been able to leave yet every time i try something kills me it's almost as if there's a legion of madness out here coming to get me waiting to exact revenge the moment we think we can get away well you know maybe they'll settle down while we wait what the hell might as well at least try to make this place look nicer always wanted to build a subterranean base and a viking game so i hope you had fun i know i did surely this isn't the end of johnny hot body don't forget to check out my streams on twitch and i'll see you next time,22:07

IN DAY, THEY HAVE TO DEPET TIFY  THE PLACE. AND THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THERE ISN'T ANY ALLERGIES. THE CLINTONS, YOU HAD TO GET RID OF THE CAT STUFF. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ALLERGIES ARE OF THE TRUMPS. BUT IT IS FUNNY. THAT'S AMONG THE THINGS THEY ARE DOING TODAY. >> THAT MOVE, AS THEY'RE GIVEN  FIVE HOURS TO DO IT, BASICALLY,  FROM THE TIME THE PROCESSION  LEAVES THE WHITE HOUSE TO THE  TIME AT THE END OF THE INAUGURAL PARADE. PETER ALEXANDER'S PIECE WAS  THOROUGH A LITTLE WHILE AGO. THEY BASICALLY CHANGE -- SOME OF IT HAS BEEN MOVED OUT OF THE  WHITE HOUSE. ONE MOVING VAN WILL LEAVE ON  THIS DAY. THAT'S TRADITION. BUT THEY CHANGE EVERYTHING,  MICHAEL, FROM THE TOOTH BUSHES  TO THE BRAND OF SHAMPOO THAT THE INCOMING FIRST FAMILY DESIRES TO HAVE IN THOSE BATHROOMS. >> AND THEY DO IT EFFORTLESSLY. AND THE FIRST FAMILY COMES IN  AND FINDS ALL OF THE FOODS THEY  LIKE, FROM THE PLACES THAT THEY  LIKE. WITH ONE EXCEPTION. AND 1969, WHEN THE NIXONS CAME  IN, THEY ASKED FOR ICE CREAM. AND TURNS OUT ALL THEY COULD  FIND WAS BUTTER BRICKELL ICE  CREAM, WHICH WAS THE FAVORITE OF THE JOHNSON GIRLS. >> THERE'S A McDONALD'S ABOUT  HALF A BLOCK FROM THE WHITE  HOUSE. AND AS WE ALL KNOW, THE INCOMING PRESIDENT LOVES HIM SOME FAST  FOOD. AND THAT McDONALD'S, WE'VE HAD A WHITE HOUSE THAT HASN'T BEEN  PRO-FAST FOOD I THINK. OUTGOING PRESIDENT DOES ENJOY  IT. BUT I HAVE A FEELING THAT  McDONALD'S WILL BUSY. >> WHEN LYNDON JOHNSON LEFT  OFFICE, IT LEFT THE SHOWER, THAT IT WERE NOT REGULATED COULD TAKE OUT THE WEST WALL. AND HE TOLD RICHARD NIXON,  YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE THIS. AND NIXON GOT BLOWN INTO THE FAR WALL. AND HE SAID, GET RID OF THIS  THING. AND HE LEFT A RECORDING DEVICE,  THAT GAVE NIXON AN IDEA, I  SHOULD BE RECORDING THINGS. NOT THE BEST IDEA IN THE NEXT  PRESIDENCY. >> HE BROUGHT UP THE THIC THINGT NIXON AND JOHNSON. JOHNSON, OBSESSED WITH  TELEVISION. AND MAYBE WE HAVEN'T HAD A  PRESIDENT THAT IS WANTS TO WATCH THE MEDIA AS MUCH WITH TRUMP,  SINCE JOHNSON, RIGHT? >> JOHNSON HAD TRIPLE  TELEVISION, BOLTED ON TO EVERY  SURFACE, INCLUDING BATHROOMS,  WHICH WAS UNUSUAL. >> AND THIS IS THE '60s. >> THE '60s. AND TWO ENORMOUS WIRE SERVICE  TICKERS FOR THE YOUNGER VIEWERS. THE WIRE TICKER WAS A DEVICE. >> THE TWITTER OF THEN. >> AND A SPIGOT WITH FRESCA, AT  THE PRESIDENT'S DESK. >> JOHNSON REFERRED TO AS  FRESCO. >> WE GLANCED PAST IT, AS WE SAW PRESIDENT OBAMA LEAVING THE DESK ON THE DESK IN THE OVAL OFFICE. TALK ABOUT THE ISN'TMEN SENTIME  IS EXPRESSED. >> THAT'S A NEW TRADITION, THAT  GOES BACK TO DONALD REAGAN, WHO  LEFT A LETTER FOR HIS PRESIDENT, GEORGE H.W. BUSH. AND A PIECE OF STATIONARY, THAT  SAID, DON'T LET THE TURKEYS GET  YOU DOWN. THERE'S SOME DAYS, GEORGE, YOU  WANT TO USE THIS STATIONERY. GO FOR IT. AND EVERY OUTGOING PRESIDENT HAS WRITTEN A SIMILAR LETTER TO THE  INCOMING PRESIDENT. >> THERE WAS A KERFUFFLE ABOUT  THE CONDITION OF THE WHITE  HOUSE. THERE WERE REPORTS THAT THINGS  HAD BEEN LIFTED. AND THERE HAD BEEN TRASH IN  PARTS OF THE WHITE HOUSE WHERE  THERE OUGHT NOT TO HAVE BEEN. AND SNARLY MESSAGES LEFT IN  DIFFERENT AREAS. >> MISSING ""Ws."" HOW REAL WAS THAT, NICOLLE? >> I WE GOT TO WORK. AND GEORGE W. BUSH TRIED TO PAY  IT FORWARD, WITH A SMOOTH  TRANSITION BETWEEN HIMSELF AND  MR. OBAMA. >> WE TALKED SHORTLY AFTER NOON, PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL DELIVER HIS INAUGURAL ADDRESS. UNDOUBTEDLY, THE MOST IMPORTANT  SPEECH HE WILL HAVE GIVEN IN HIS LIFE. DOES HE HAVE ANY CHANCE BETWEEN  THIS MOMENT AND THAT MOMENT, TO  SIT IN SOME QUIET ROOM AND GO  OVER THOSE REMARKS BEFORE HE  DELIVERS IT TO THE WORLD? >> NOT MUCH. YOU LOOK AT PRESIDENTS TO SEE,  DID THEY JUST BEFORE THEY WALKED ON TO THE CAPITOL STEPS -- I  WON'T DESCRIBE WHAT A TELEPHONE  BOOTH WAS. AND MAKE A FEW NOTATIONS. AND THEY DON'T HAVE HAVE THE  TIME. >> CAN I MENTION, GEORGE W. BUSH AND LAURA BUSH ARRIVING AT THE  CAPITOL. MAKING THE TRIP TO WASHINGTON,  DESPITE THE FACT HIS FATHER, AND MOTHER ARE IN ILL HEALTH. BUT SAYING THEY ARE COMING TO  REPRESENT THE BUSH FAMILY. AND THE GOOD NEWS IS, THAT  GEORGE H.W. BUSH AND BARBARA  BUSH ARE SAID TO BE DOING  BETTER. >> NOT ONLY THAT, WE GOT TO HEAR SOME STORIES WE WON'T SHARE HOW  MUCH BETTER HE'S DOING. IT WAS GOOD NEWS TO HEAR. >> THAT'S A TEASE, CHUCK. YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DO THAT. WHAT GOES ON IN COMMERCIALS  STAYS IN COMMERCIALS. >> ANOTHER GREAT REAGAN STORY. AFTER HE LEFT OFFICE AND HE CAME BACK, AND HE DESCRIBED TO A  PUBLIC AUDIENCE WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO RETURN. AND HE SAID, WE MADE THE SLOW  TURN OVER THE NATION'S CAPITAL,  AND SAW THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT. THE JEFFERSON MONUMENT. AND DAVID GERGEN IN THE ROSE  GARDEN. >> DAVID GERGEN. AN OLD JOKE BACK FROM THE DAY  THAT SERVED IN FOUR OR  FIVE-STRAIGHT PRESIDENCIES. >> IT IS INEVITABLE THAT IN THE  HOURS THAT FOLLOW, SOMEBODY WILL POST AN AERIAL VIEW OF THE MALL  IN WASHINGTON. AND OVER LAY THIS SCENE WITH  WHAT HAPPENED FOUR YEARS AGO,  AND EIGHT YEARS AGO, FOR BARACK  OBAMA. AND TRY TO COMPARE THE SIZE OF  THE AUDIENCE. AND EQUATE IT TO ENTHUSIASM. >> THAT IS INEVIDENCIBLE. HE COMES IN DIVIDED. HAD HILLARY CLINTON WON, SHE  WOULD HAVE BEEN THE MOST  UNPOPULAR INCOMING PRESIDENT AT  THE TIME. THIS WAS A DIVISIVE ELECTION. IT'S A DIVIDED COUNTRY. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF ENTHUSIASM. I GO BACK. I THINK IN THE TRUMP TRANSITION, THEY'VE MISSED SOME  OPPORTUNITIES TO LITTLE MOMENTS  THAT COULD HAVE BROUGHT THE  COUNTRY TOGETHER IN A BIGGER  WAY. >> I AGREE WITH THAT. THAT'S ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR  A PRESIDENT ELECTED WITHOUT THE  POPULAR VOTE, WITH A RELATIVELY  NARROW ELECTORAL VOTE MAJORITY. IF HE HAD DONE MORE OF THAT, WE  WOULD SEE NUMBERS HIGHER TODAY. >> YOUR BOSS, GEORGE W. BUSH, HE SPENT A SHORTER TRANSITION,  WORRIED ABOUT THE ASTERISK, AS I CALLED IT. HE ERASED IT. >> I'M WATCHING THE PICTURES. AND I IMAGINE THEM SAYING, DID  YOU PACK MY GOLF CLUBS? THIS IS THE LAST TIME THEY WILL  STAND THERE. AND IT'S JUST REMARKABLE. YOU KNOW. >> THIS IS TAPE. I WANT PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND. IT'S A DIFFERENT ANGLE. >> WAITING FOR THEM TO WALK IN. >> THEY WERE WAITING FOR THE CAR TO PULL UP. AND YOU WANT TO HEAR THE INSIDE  OF THESE CONVERSATIONS. >> I THINK HE'S SAYING, WHAT'S  FOR DINNER TONIGHT? >> OR WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO  TOMORROW? WE'RE FREE. >> JUST THINKING, I HOPE THE  MARINES DIDN'T LOCK THEIR KNEES. >> WE SAW THE VIDEO THAT  MICHELLE OBAMA POSTED A COUPLE  OF NIGHTS AGO WITH HER TAKING  HER LAST WALK THROUGH WITH THE  DOGS. AND SHE TWEETED, IT HAS BEEN THE HONOR OF MY LIFE TO BE YOUR  FIRST LADY. BEHIND THE SCENES, WHAT IS THE  FEELING ABOUT HER EMOTIONS AS  SHE PREPARES TO LEAVE? >> I THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA  PULLED BACK THE CURTAIN. AND OUR DAUGHTER SAW THIS  ELECTION. SHE HAD BEEN SHAKEN TO HER CORE  BY DONALD TRUMP'S STATEMENTS AND THE ""ACCESS HOLLYWOOD"" TAPE. THEY TOOK THIS CAMPAIGN  PERSONALLY. AND THEIR GRACIOUSNESS IS  DESPITE THEIR FEELINGS THAT WERE REAL DURING THE CAMPAIGN. >> WHEN HE WAS RUNNING FOR  OFFICE, BARACK OBAMA WAS RUNNING FOR OFFICE, THERE WAS A WAITING  TIME IN CHICAGO WHEN SHE WAS  DESCRIBED AS NOT A SISTER. SHE HAD GONE TO IVY LEAGUE  SCHOOLS AND SHE HAD DONE WELL. AND ""THE CHICAGO SUN TIMES"" HAD  A REVEALING FRONT PAGE STORY  ABOUT HER. AND SHE SAID, WHAT DO THEY  EXPECT FROM ME? MY FATHER WAS A MUNICIPAL  WORKER. HE WAS HANDICAPPED. AND I WENT TO PRINCETON AND  HARVARD. ISN'T THAT WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED  TO DO. >> THAT'S DONALD TRUMP JR.,  ALONG WITH HIS WIFE AND  CHILDREN. ARRIVING AT THE CAPITOL. IT OCCURS WE WILL SEE A  DIFFERENT FIRST FAMILY IN THE  WHITE HOUSE. ALTHOUGH, BARON TRUMP IS 10. HE WILL STAY IN NEW YORK WITH  MELANIA AND FINISH THE SCHOOL  YEAR. WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT, JARED  KUSHNER AND IVANKA TRUMP ARE NOT TWO CHILDREN -- ONE IS A  SON-IN-LAW. THESE TWO ARE GOING TO BECOME  THE POWER COUPLE IN WASHINGTON. >> THIS IS -- NOT ONLY THAT. THIS IS TRUMP HAS EMBRACED THE  IDEA. HE WANTS TO BE COMPARED TO THE  KENNEDYS. AND IN SOME WAY, IT IS A COMPARE COMPARISON. THE KENNEDYS, POLITICS WAS THE  FAMILY BUSINESS. AND FOR DONALD TRUMP, BUSINESS  IS FAMILY BUSINESS. AND THE NEW BUSINESS IS  POLITICS. AND HE WANTS THE -- THAT'S WHO  HIS TRUSTED ADVISERS ARE. AND MOST TRUSTED WILL ALWAYS  HAVE THE LAST NAME OF KUSHNER. >> DONALD TRUMP JR. IS THE  OLDEST OF THE TRUMP CHILDREN. IVANKA IS SECOND. ERIC IS THIRD. AND FOLLOWED BY TIFFANY, THE  DAUGHTER HE HAS WITH MARLA  MAPLES TRUMP. AND BARON, I MENTIONED, 10 YEARS OLD. YOU HAVE TO STOP AND THINK ABOUT HOW -- WE'VE SEEN THIS WITH,  OBVIOUSLY, JENNA BUSH HAGER AND  HER SISTER AND SASHA AND MALIA. HOW LIFE IS GOING TO CHANGE. AND I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE THE TRADITIONAL CHANGE WE'RE USED TO SEEING. >> THE FAMILY DOESN'T ASK FOR  THIS LIFE. MOST DON'T WANT THIS LIFE. WE KNOW THAT MELANIA WAS SORT OF A RELUCTANT PARTICIPANT IN MANY  WAYS THAT LAURA BUSH WAS  RELUCTANT. AND SOUNDS LIKE MICHELLE OBAMA,  AS WELL. WHEN YOU HAVE A 10-YEAR-OLD  CHILD IN THE MIDDLE OF A SCHOOL  YEAR, YOU'RE WISE TO KEEP HIS  INTEREST FIRST AS YOUR FIRST  PRIORITY. >> YOU CONSIDER ASKING ABOUT  MICHELLE OBAMA. SHE IS LOOKING FORWARD TO  CIVILIAN LIFE, I THINK, MORE  THAN ANY OF -- >> OUT OF THE BUBBLE. >> OUT OF THE BUBBLE. SHE HAS BEEN ON STAGE FOR EIGHT  YEARS. AND YOU KNOW, SHE HAD A ROUGH  TIME DURING EARLY PARTS OF THAT  '08 CAMPAIGN. AND SO, SHE REALLY SORT OF, YOU  KNOW, DECIDED, SHE WASN'T GOING  TO SPEAK HER MIND. IT WASN'T UNTIL THIS CAMPAIGN  THAT YOU SAW HER SPEAK HER MIND  MORE SO POLITICALLY THAN EVER  BEFORE. IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE  THE ROLE SHE CARVES OUT FOR  HERSELF. I HEARD OTHERS AROUND OBAMA, HE  IS MINDFUL. IT'S HER TURN. WHAT SHE WANTS TO DO, HE WANTS  TO SUPPORT THAT. >> AND THERE WAS TALK SAYING  THAT, MICHELLE, IT'S YOUR TURN,  IN A DIFFERENT WAY. >> SHE SHUT THAT DOWN. BUT SHE LEAVES INCREDIBLY  POPULAR. AND MOST FIRST LADIES ARE ALWAYS MORE POPULAR THAN THEIR  HUSBANDS. BUT SHE HAS QUITE A PLATFORM. >> AND USUALLY, THEIR BOOKS  OUTSELL THE MEMOIRS OF THEIR  HUSBANDS. >> EXACTLY. >> PEOPLE ARE CURIOUS. THAT'S THE THING. WE'LL REALLY KNOW WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT AT THAT MOMENT. PROBABLY MORE IN MICHELLE'S  MEMOIR. NOT PRESIDENT OBAMA'S. >> STANDS AT THE CAPITOL ARE  FILLING UP. THAT'S THE V.I.P. SECTION. YOU SEE, THE WEST PART OF THE  CAPITOL. THE AREA IN FRONT OF THE MALL,  FOR A CEREMONY THAT BEGINS AT  11:30. WITH THE SWEARING-IN TAKING  PLACE AT ABOUT NOON. AND INAUGURAL ADDRESS COMING IN  AFTER THAT. KELLYANNE CONWAY, STEVEN BANNAN  ARRIVING AT THE CAPITOL. >> HE SHAVED. WE'RE ALL FOR THE FACIAL HAIR. NOTHING WRONG LIKE THAT. HE SEEMS TO HAVE THREE-DAY  GROWTH. >> IT'S A BIG DAY. >> THE ARRIVAL OF THOSE TWO IN  THE CAMPAIGN, BY THE WAY, WAS  IMPORTANT. >> BEGINNING OF THE COMEBACK  THAT DELIVERED A VICTORY. >> I'M GOING TO TURN THINGS OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE, LESTER HOLT, IN A MINUTE. ALL STICKING AROUND. A LONG DAY FOR YOU GUYS. THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING PART OF OUR COVERAGE THIS MORNING. NBC NEWS CONTINUING COVERAGE OF  THIS INAUGURATION, RIGHT AFTER  THIS. WE'LL TAKE A QUICK BREAK. THEY WILL BE DEPARTING SHORTLY  FOR THE U.S. CAPITOL. AND WE ARE FOLLOWING IT ALL NOW. OUR COVERAGE ON NBC NEWS BEGINS  RIGHT NOW. >> FROM NBC NEWS, THE  INAUGURATION OF DONALD TRUMP,  LIVE FROM WASHINGTON. HERE'S LESTER HOLT. >> AND THERE'S A LIVE PICTURE OF THE WHITE HOUSE -- OF THE  CAPITOL, ACTUALLY, OF COURSE. ANDS THERE'S THE WHITE HOUSE. IN A SHORT TIME, PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP AND PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL  BEGIN THEIR TRIP TO THE U.S.  CAPITOL WHERE MR. TRUMP WILL BE  SWORN IN AROUND NOON EASTERN  TIME. IT WILL BE THE START OF A NEW  ERA IN WASHINGTON AND THIS  COUNTRY, WHAT MANY SEE AS A  CLEAN BREAK FROM THE LAST EIGHT  YEARS UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA. I AM JOINED FOR OUR COVERAGE BY  CHUCK TODD, OUR POLITICAL  DIRECTOR AND MODERATOR OF ""MEET  THE PRESS"" BY TOM BROKAW WHO HAS COVERED THE COMINGS AND GOINGS  OF PRESIDENTS SINCE LYNDON  JOHNSON AND BY NICOLE WALLACE,  NBC POLITICAL NEWS ANALYST. TOM, LET ME START WITH YOU. WE HAVE SEEN IN MANY, MANY  CAMPAIGNS WHERE, YOU KNOW, HARSH WORDS WERE SAID. BUT TO SEE THE RELATIONSHIP THAT WE'VE SEEN BETWEEN PRESIDENT  OBAMA AND PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP  IN THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS, HOW  WOULD YOU DESCRIBE IT? >> WELL, I THINK THAT PRESIDENT  OBAMA WANTED TO GO OUT ON A HIGH NOTE. HE'S GOT VERY GOOD APPROVAL  RATINGS AS HE LEAVES OFFICE. I THINK HE HAS A GREAT, GREAT  SENSE OF THE DIGNITY OF THIS  MOMENT AND THE IMPORTANCE OF IT. AND THE COUNTRY HE ALSO  UNDERSTANDS NEEDS TO BE HEALED  AND PERHAPS HE'S THINKING WE CAN BEGIN THE PROCESS, THE TWO OF  US, FOR ALL THE DIVISION THAT  WENT ON DURING THE CAMPAIGN. NOW IT'S TIME TO FIND WAYS THAT  WE CAN WORK TOGETHER. IT'S A XWOLIC ACT, BUT IT CAN BE VERY IMPORTANT, IN MY JUDGMENT. >> CHUCK, THEY'RE SITTING DOWN  HAVING COFFEE RIGHT NOW AT THE  WHITE HOUSE. PRESIDENT OBAMA CALLING DONALD  TRUMP AT WITH ONE POINT UNFIT,  WOEFULLY UNPREPARED. WE KNOW DONALD TRUMP QUESTIONED  HIS CITIZENSHIP. TALK US THROUGH THIS. >> LOOK, IT IS, IN SOME WAYS, IT MAY BE REMARKABLE THAT THEY HAVE FORGED A RELATIONSHIP, BUT  IT'S -- THEY HAVE. IT'S OUT OF NECESSITY WITH  PRESIDENT OBAMA'S MOTIVATION,  ONE, I THINK BEING WHAT TOM  BROUGHT UP. THE OTHER PART IS THE SERIOUS  BUSINESS OF THE TRANSITION. PART OF IT IS HOW HE WAS TREATED BY GEORGE W. BUSH IN HIS  TRANSITION AND HE WANTS TO PAY  THAT FORWARD. BUT THIS RELATIONSHIP, LOOK,  DONALD TRUMP HAS RECIPROCATED AS BARACK OBAMA HAS REACHED OUT. DONALD TRUMP HAS ALSO REACHED  BACK OUT TO HIM. AND BY THE WAY, JOE BIDEN AND  MIKE PENCE HAVE FORGED AN  INTERESTING PERSONAL  RELATIONSHIP. LOOK, IT IS HELPFUL TO THE  COUNTRY TO KNOW AND I THINK FOR  ANYBODY THAT'S NOT EXCITED, BUT  FEELING ANXIOUS ABOUT TODAY,  THEY PROBABLY FEEL BETTER  KNOWING THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA AND PRESIDENT -- THE NEXT PRESIDENT  TRUMP DO GET ALONG. >> THIS -- AS YOU'RE LOOKING AT, THIS IS THE PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER THAT WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT  OR EVEN SOME OF THE LOW POINTS  OF THE CAMPAIGN. THIS IS THE WAY IT IS DONE IN  THE UNITED STATES. NICOLE, WHAT ABOUT THE ISSUE OF  ADVICE? WE KNOW THEY'VE HAD A LOT OF  CONVERSATIONS. I WOULD SUSPECT WHAT IS  HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IS MORE  POLITE IN NATURE, BUT HOW MUCH  BUSINESS HAS GOTTEN DONE? HOW MUCH INFLUENCE DO YOU THINK  B PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS HAD ON MR. TRUMP? >> WELL, LISTEN, THAT FIRST  MEETING BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM  JUST TWO DAYS AFTER THE ELECTION WAS EXTRAORDINARY AND IT WENT  LONG. IT WENT 30 MINUTES LONGER THAN  PLANNED. AND THERE DONALD TRUMP, WHO  CREATED THE BIRTHER MOVEMENT SAT ALMOST KNEE TO KNEE AND WAS  MAKING THE ARGUMENTS FOR HIS  LACK OF FITNESS FOR THE  PRESIDENCY. BUT THEY BOTH STAND TO GAIN  SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO EACH OF  THEM. DONALD TRUMP IS NOT A  PARTICULARLY IDEALLOGICAL MAN. AND WHILE HE'S MADE SOME IDEA  IDEALOGICAL APPOINTMENTS,  THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR  PRESIDENT OBAMA TO SHAPE SOME OF THE ISSUES HE CARES ABOUT THE  MOST. I KNOW THEY'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OBAMACARE,  HOW PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL TWEAK  IT, REBRAND IT IN SOME WAYS AND  KEEP SOME OF THE THINGS MOST  IMPORTANT TO PRESIDENT OBAMA. AND ON DONALD TRUMP'S PART, HE  IS GOING TO HAVE A MOMENT IN HIS PRESIDENCY WHERE HE'S GOING TO  NEED THE OTHER HALF OF THE  COUNTRY THAT DIDN'T VOTE FOR  HIM. YOU KNOW, IT BOTHERS HIM THAT HE DIDN'T WIN THE POPULAR VOTE. AND WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE HE  TALKS ABOUT IT INCESSANTLY. IT BOTHERS HIM THAT HE'S BEING  SWORN IN WITH SOME OF THE  APPROVAL RATINGS AND WE KNOW  THAT BECAUSE HE TALKS ABOUT IT  ALL THE TIME. AND IT BOTHERS HIM WHEN HE'S  CRITICIZED ON TELEVISION AND WE  KNOW THAT, TOO, BECAUSE HE TALKS ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME. SO WHEN HE WANTS TO LAY A  BIPARTISAN FEEL ON SOMETHING, HE HAS AN OPEN LINE OF  COMMUNICATION WITH PRESIDENT  OBAMA AND I CAN SEE HIM ASKING  SOMETHING OF THE FORMER  PRESIDENT. >> PRESIDENTS DON'T TURN DOWN  OTHER PRESIDENTS. THAT'S JUST DON'T. THAT CLUB IS SMALL AND IT WILL  BE INTERESTING. LOOK, I THINK THAT AS PRESIDENT  ELECT, HE HAS NOT USED THAT  CONVENING POWER THAT HE ALREADY  HAS TO CREATE MOMENTS. AS PRESIDENT, I THINK, YOU KNOW, WILL HE USE THAT? AGAIN, THAT SORT OF CONVENING  POWER THAT YOU HAVE TO GET --  WHEN IT'S NECESSARY. I THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL BE  ANSWERING THAT CALL WHEN ASKED. >> WHEN ASKED, YES. >> I AM SURPRISED HE HASN'T DONE IT. >> NONE OF THE FORMER PRESIDENTS WHO ARE HERE TODAY VOTED FOR  HIM. I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S  HAPPENED BEFORE. >> WELL, LET ME BRING IN MICHAEL BENCHLOSS, PRESIDENTIAL  HISTORIAN. MICHAEL, ON THAT POINT AND THIS  POINT OF IT BEING A VERY SMALL  CLUB, HOW MUCH DO THEY  ULTIMATELY RELY ON EACH OTHER,  HISTORICALLY? >> OFTENTIMES, THEY DO A LOT. JOHN KENNEDY 1961 ENCOUNTERED  THE HUGE FAILURE OF THE BAY OF  PIGS, THE FAILURE OF THE CIA  BACKED FREEDOM FIGHTERS TO TAKE  THE ISLAND AWAY FROM CASTRO. HE WAS VERY EMBARRASSED. THE FIRST THING DEWAS CALL IT  DWIGHT EISENHOWER, THE STILL  IMMENSELY POPULAR HERO OF D-DAY  WHO HAD JUST RETIRED FROM THE  PRESIDENCY. THEY WERE PHOTOGRAPHED TOGETHER  AT CAMP DAVID. THAT HELPED KENNEDY POLITICALLY  AND PUBLICLY. EISENHOWER SAID, MR. PRESIDENT,  FORGIVE ME IF I'M BEING BLUNT,  BUT IF YOU EVER DO THIS AGAIN,  MAKE SURE WE DON'T FAIL. >> AND THERE'S A VIEW OF THE  CAPITAL RIGHT NOW, PEOPLE  GATHERING AROUND THE WEST FRONT  WHERE THE SWEARING IN WILL TAKE  PLACE A LITTLE OVER TWO HOURS  FROM NOW. THAT'S A CHOIR. MANY OF THOSE WILL BE TAKING  PLACE, THE OTHER END OF  PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE WE'RE  KEEPING A CLOSE I EYE. THAT CONVERSATION AND INFORMAL  GREETING AND FORMAL, IF YOU  WOULD, BETWEEN THE CURRENT  PRESIDENT AND FIRST LADY AND THE FUTURE PRESIDENT AND FIRST LADY. YOU SEE SOME OF THOSE BLANK  SPOTS IN THE CAPITOL MALL BEING  FILLED IN. SOME OF THAT IS THE VIP AREA. AND BEYOND THAT, PEOPLE ARE  FILLING IN UP AND DOWN THE MALL  TO WITNESS THIS HISTORIC EVENT. I WAS OUTSIDE JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO. IT IS KIND OF A DAMP COLD OUT  THERE. IT IS A DRIZZLING --  MARCHERS. AS A KID WHO WAS IN THE MARCHING BAND AND PLAYED AN INSTRUMENT,  THE FACT THAT IT IS NOT FREEZING TODAY, THE FACT THAT THEY GET  INSTRUMENTS. >> IT IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY. PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE DEVISIVE,  AND THE TOUGH ELECTION. I WANT TO REMIND FOLKS TODAY,  TAKE A STEP BACK AND WITNESS THE SPECTACLE OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY. IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW TOUGH IT  GETS, HOW NOISY IT GETS, HOW  LOUD IT GETS THAT WE'RE ABLE TO  DO THIS, A TRANSFER OF POWER. IT SOUNDS CORNY, BUT --  >> I'M WITH YOU. >> ABSOLUTELY. >> THE ELECTION NIGHTS ARE  SPECIAL TO ME. THIS IS ALMOST THE WAY YOU FEEL  ON THE FOURTH OF JULY. THERE'S AN EXTRA BOUNCE IN YOUR  STEP ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT  INAUGURATION DAY BECAUSE IT IS  THE ULTIMATE CELEBRATION OF THE  THIS COUNTRY'S DEMOCRACY. >> WE WANT TO GO RIGHT MOW TO  PETER ALEXANDER WHO IS OUTSIDE  ST. JOHN'S CHURCH. >> LESTER, GOOD DAY TO YOU. WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPOOK  BRIEFLY WITH MIKE PENCE ABOUT  THE SERMON, WHICH HE CALLED VERY MOVING AND ABOUT THIS DAY THAT  HE SAID WAS VERY HUMBLING. DONALD TRUMP DIDN'T SAY QUITE AS MUCH, BUT HE CERTAINLY WAS ALL  THUMBS UP, POINT TO GO ME  REPEATEDLY AS HE SAID HE FELT  GOOD ABOUT THIS DAY. I EXCHANGED A COUPLE OF TEXT  MESSAGES WITH HIS SON, ERIC  TRUMP, A SHORT TIME AGO WHO SAID THAT HIS FATHER IS GOING TO DO  VERY WELL AND MAKE THIS COUNTRY  VERY PROUD. THE FAMILY IS FEELING  PARTICULARLY GOOD, AS YOU CAN  IMAGINE, ON THIS DAY. AND WHAT WAS NOTABLE AS THEY  ARRIVED HERE WAS JUST HOW BIG  THAT CIRCLE IS THAT SORT OF GREW INTO THIS OFFICE WITH THEM. WE SAW STEVE BANNON, REINCE  PRIEBUS. IN TERMS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING  INSIDE THAT WHITE HOUSE THIS  MORM MORNING, AT ABOUT ROUGHLY  9:30, 8:30, I SHOULD SAY, EXCUSE ME, IN THE MORNING THE PRESIDENT WAS IN THE STATE DINING ROOM  WITH HIS FAMILY. IT WAS THEIR OPPORTUNITY OR THE  LAST TIME TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO  THEIR STAFF. AS IS TRADITION, HE WAS  PRESENTED WITH A GIFT. WE HAVE LEARNED EXACTLY WHAT  THAT GIFT WAS. IT WAS A HAND CARVED WOODEN BOX  WITH THE FLAG THAT FLEW ABOVE  THE WHITE HOUSE ON HIS FIRST  INAUGURATION DAY, AS WELL AS THE FLAG THAT FLEW ABOVE THE WHITE  HOUSE ON HIS FINAL DAY IN  OFFICE. THAT IS A TRADITION THAT DATES  BACK DECADES HERE AS WELL AS  THEY MEET RIGHT NOW DURING THAT  TEA, THAT COFFEE TAKING PLACE. AS SOON AS THEY DEPART,  PRESIDENT OBAMA AND MICHELLE  OBAMA LEAVING FOR THE LAST TIME. THAT'S WHEN THE CHAOS OF THE DAY BEGINS. IT'S AT THAT MOMENT THAT THE  TRANSITION OF PROPERTY, AS IT  WERE, YOU KNOW, THE PEACEFUL  TRANSITION OF POWER. THIS IS THE PEACEFUL TRANSITION  OF PROPERTY. THAT BEGINS IN EARNEST. THEY HAVE ROUGHLY FIVE HOURS IN  TOTAL TO SWAP OUT ALL OF THE  PROPERTY WITHIN THE RESIDENCE  THAT BELONGED TO THE OBAMAS AND  REPLACE IT WITH STUFF THAT THE  TRUMPS PREFER. THAT INCLUDES REDECORATING IN  THE WEST WING, SPECIFICALLY THE  OVAL OFFICE TODAY, AS WELL. LESTER, BACK TO YOU. >> AND PETER, WE'VE HEARD A LOT  ABOUT THAT QUICK TRANSITION, BUT WHAT ABOUT THE BUSINESS OF  GOVERNING IN TERMS OF THE KEY  OFFICES IN THE WHITE HOUSE? DO PEOPLE GO RIGHT TO WORK? >> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. IN FACT, AT 12:01 TODAY, WE ARE  TOLD SOME OF THOSE KEY  INDIVIDUALS, THOSE CLOSEST  ADVISERS WHO ARE ALREADY  APPOINTEES, WHO ARE ALSO IN  THESE ROLES WILL GO DIRECTLY  INTO THEIR OFFICE, INTO THEIR  OFFICES. WHAT WAS NOTABLE THIS MORNING IS THAT OVERNIGHT, IN FACT, WE SAW  SOME PICTURES FROM INSIDE THE  WEST WING THAT WAS BASICALLY  BARREN. IT'S SOMETHING THAT I'VE NEVER  SEEN BEFORE. HAVING WORKED IN THE WHITE HOUSE AS A REPORTER, OF COURSE, OVER  THE COURSE OF THE LAST FOUR  YEARS, THE WALLS ARE USUALLY  FILLED WITH A GALLERY OF PHOTOS  OF THE OBAMAAS ARE THERE. WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP ARRIVES A  SHORT TIME THIS AFTERNOON, THE  PHOTOS WILL BE REPLACE DOLLARS  OUTSIDE HIS OFFICE BY TRADITION  WITH SOME PHOTOS FROM THE  INAUGURAL CEREMONY TODAY AND BY  THE TIME HE ARRIVES, MANY OF HIS STAFFERS WILL BE IN PLACE TO  ASSUME THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES. >> A PAIR OF FORMER SPEAKERS  THERE WALKING THEIR WAY OUT ON  TO THE PLATFORM AT THE CAPITAL. LET'S GO TO HALLIE JACKSON TO  SET THE SCENE. >> HEY THERE, LESTER. THE VIP PLATFORM BEHIND ME ON  THE WEST FRONT IS FILLING UP  HERE. YOU'RE WATCHING FORMER SPEAKERS  NEWT GINGRICH, JOHN BOEHNER  WALKING OUT AND TAKING THEIR  POSITIONS. A LOT OF FOLKS ARE SNAPPING  PICTURES ON THE PHONE OF  EVERYTHING UNFOLDING. SHELDON ADELSON IS HERE, AS  WELL, A REPUBLICAN DONOR. HE HAS AN AISLE SEAT NOT TOO FAR BACK FROM THE PODIUM WHERE THE  PRESIDENT-ELECT, SOON SO BE  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WILL BE  DELIVERING HIS INAUGURAL  ADDRESS. I HAD A BRIEF TEXT CONVERSATION  WITH ONE MEMBER OF CONGRESS AND  ASKING HOW THEY'RE FEELING ABOUT TODAY. THE RESPONSE WAS ONE WORD, WET. THE RAIN HAS STOPPED HERE AT THE CAPITOL, ALTHOUGH THERE WERE  SOME FOLKS OUT WIPING DOWN THE  SEATS TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS COMFORTABLE FOR THE PEOPLE AS  THEY GET READY FOR THE PROGRAM  TO BEGIN NOT TOO LONG FROM NOW. WE'VE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT  DONALD TRUMP'S ACTIVITIES THIS  MORNING PUBLICLY. PRIVATELY, WE KNOW HE STARTED  HIS DAY WHERE HE SOMETIMES DOES  AND THAT IS ON TWITTER, SENDING  OUT A MESSAGE TO HIS MILLIONS OF FOLLOWERS SAYING THE MOVEMENT  BEGINS TODAY. WE ARE GOING TO GET TO WORK,  ESSENTIALLY. AND A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS  TWITTER SITUATION. HE WILL TAKE OVER LATER TODAY. THE OFFICIAL POTUS ACCOUNT. ALL THE TWEETS FROM THE LAST  EIGHT YEARS FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA UNDER THAT POTUS ACCOUNT ROLL  OVER TO A NEW HANDLE AND THAT IS POTUS44 WHERE THOSE TWEETS WILL  BE ARCHIVED FOR THE RECORD. DONALD TRUMP SAID HE WILL USE  BOTH HIS PERSONAL ACCOUNT AND  THE OFFICIAL WHITE HOUSE ACCOUNT AS WELL. WE EXPECT THE INAUGURAL ADDRESS  TO BE ROUGHLY 20 MINUTES. THAT'S ABOUT HOW LONG PRESIDENT  OBAMA'S PRIOR ADDRESSES HAVE  BEEN, AS WELL. SO THAT'S TYPICALLY SORT OF  WITHIN THE TIME FRAME WE WOULD  THINK AS WE WATCH MORE PEOPLE  WALKING INTO THE CAPITOL HERE. WE KNOW SEVERAL GOVERNORS HAVE  ARRIVED, TOO. GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE, ONE OF  THE FIRST FORMER RIVALS TO COME  OUT AND ENDORSE DONALD TRUMP IN  THE CAMPAIGN. THERE WAS A LOT OF EXPECTATIONS  OVER THE SUMMER THAT PERHAPS  CHRISTIE WOULD LAND A COVETED  SPOT IN THE CABINET OR  ADMINISTRATION. ULTIMATELY, IT DID NOT TURN OUT  THAT WAY. WISCONSIN GOVERNOR TOM WALKER  HAS ARRIVED ALONG WITH JOHN  KASICH WHO WAS ONE OF THE  LEADERS OF THE TRUMP NEVER  MOVEMENTS. THE MARINE CORPS BAND IS PLAYING DOWN BELOW. YOU PROBABLY HEAR THOSE SOUNDS  WAFTING UP TR WHERE WE ARE. MORE AND MORE PEOPLE NOT JUST  BELOW THE STANDS, BUT ALL THE  WAY DOWN. ABOUT AN HOUR AGO, WE SAW ONE OF THE PRESIDENT-ELECT'S TOP AIDES, STEVEN MILLER, HIS POLICY  ADVISER AND SPEECH WRITING GURU  STEPPING TO THE PODIUM TO DO  SOME OF THOSE LAST-MINUTE CHECKS MAKING SURE THE MICROPHONE WAS  AT THE RIGHT HEIGHT, CHECKING  THE TELEPROMPTER. THEY'VE REMOVED THE PLASTIC FROM THE CHAIRS. EVERYTHING READY NOW FOR THE  ARRIVAL OF DONALD TRUMP. >> LET'S REVIEW WHAT HAS BEEN  GOING ON THIS MORNING AND WHAT  IS TO COME. THE PRESIDENT-ELECT AND HIS  FAMILY BEGIN THEIR DAY LEAVING  BLAIR HOUSE TO ATTEND A WORSHIP  SERVICE AT ST. JOHN'S CHURCH,  KNOWN AS THE CHURCH OF THE  PRESIDENT. IT'S AN INAUGURATION DAY  TRADITION DATING BACK TO FDR IN  193 3. FROM THERE, MR. TRUMP AND HIS  WIFE, MELANIA, HEADED TO THE  WHITE HOUSE FOR MORNING TEA AND  COFFEE WITH THE PRESIDENT AND  FIRST LADY BEFORE THE PROCESSION TO THE CAPITOL. THEY'LL ALL BE RIDING TOGETHER,  ALWAYS INTERESTING TO HEAR ABOUT THE CONVERSATIONS THAT TAKE  PLACE IN THAT CAR. THE SWEARING IN CEREMONY STARTS  AROUND 11:30 ON THE WEST FRONT  OF THE CAPITOL. SUPREME COURT JUSTICE JOHN  ROBERTS WILL BE ADMINISTERING  THE OATH OF OFFICE AND PRESIDENT TRUMP AT THAT POINT WILL GIVE  HIS INAUGURAL ADDRESS. IT'S EXPECTED TO LAST ABOUT 20  MINUTES AND TRUMP'S TEAM SAYS IT WILL BE A PERSONAL AND SINCERE  STATEMENT ABOUT HIS VISION FOR  THE COUNTRY. AND WE'LL BE TURNING TO OUR NBC  NEWS CORRESPONDENTS THROUGHOUT  OUR COVERAGE FOR REPORTING HERE  IN WASHINGTON AND BEYOND. BUT RIGHT NOW, WE'RE GOING TO  TAKE A SHORT BREAK ASK BE BACK  WITH MORE  >>> WELCOME BACK. A LIVE LOOK AT PENNSYLVANIA  AVENUE. PRESIDENT OBAMA AND FIRST LADY  MICHELLE OBAMA WILL BE TAKING  DICK CHENEY WAS IN A WHEELCHAIR  ON THAT DAY OF TURN OVER. IT'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER THERE  WILL BE ANY INTERACTION, ANY  CHANCE FOR AN INTERACTION TODAY. >> THIS IS ONE OF MY PAL, MY  PARTNER, MARK MURRAY. THIS WILL BE THE FIRST TIME THEY ARE IN THE SAME SPACE -- YOU  DON'T WANT TO SAY SAME INDOORS  SINCE THEY'RE NOT INDOORS, SAME  SPACE SINCE THE AL SMITH DINNER. >> AND THERE ARE THE CHENEYS. >> YOU WERE ASKING. >> THERE'S THE HAT. >> ASK AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE. >> LOOKS GREAT, DOESN'T HE? LOOKS HEALTHY. >> HE'S DOING GREAT. >> DAUGHTER, LIZ, A MEMBER OF  CONGRESS. >> YEP. >> AND HE LOOKS WELL. >> HE'S OUT THERE FLY FISHING  AND HOLDING FORTH. HE LIVES IN JACKSON HOLE. >> STEVE SCALIA AND STENY HOYER. >> WE LISTEN THE IN A LITTLE BIT HERE. >> ALWAYS FUN TO EAVESDROP. >> YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU GET  THE COOL HOT MIKE MOMENT. >> WELL, WE ARE JOINED HERE ON  OUR PANEL BY HUGH HEWITT, NBC  NEWS AND MSNBC RADIO ANALYST ON  THE SALEM NETWORK. GOOD TO SEE YOU. >> GOOD TO BE HERE, LESTER. IT'S FUN WATCHING THIS FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE AND TO SEE ALL THE  OLD FACES. EIGHT YEARS AGO, VICE PRESIDENT  CHENEY WAS IN BAD SHAPE AND  SINCE THAT TIME HAS RECOVERED  REMARKABLY WELL AND LOOKS  TERRIFIC THIS AFTERNOON, THIS  MORNING AS THEY GATHER. AND I THINK CHUCK SAID WHEN I  WAS OFF SET, IT'S THE FOURTH OF  JULY. IT REALLY IS THE CIVIC PAGEANT. I DON'T KNOW HOW ANYONE CAN NOT  ENJOY IT, WHATEVER THEIR POLICY. >> AND BEFORE YOU BREAK, I  WANTED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION  ABOUT THE STATE OF THE COUNTRY  WITH THIS TRANSITION OF POWER  VERSUS EIGHT YEARS AGO WHEN THE  COUNTRY WAS ON THE ECONOMIC  BRINK, THE AUTO INDUSTRY WAS ON  THE BRINK. WILL DONALD TRUMP HAVE MORE  RUNNING ROOM, MORE OF A  HONEYMOON OF SOME SORT, GIVEN  THE FACT THAT THE COUNTRY IS NOT IN AN EMERGENCY STATE, AS IT  WAS? >> HE NEEDS TO EARN THIS  HONEYMOON. I THINK HE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO EARN IT. BUT HE'S -- I'M SORRY, I'VE SAID IT BEFORE -- HE MISSED SOME  OPPORTUNITIES THESE LAST SIX TO  EIGHT WEEKS TO -- AND AGAIN, TO  JUST ERASE THE ASTERISK. WHATEVER YOU WANT TO SAY ABOUT  IT AND I KNOW SOME SUPPORTERS  WILL SAY, WHY DO US THAT? BUT LOOK, WHEN YOU WIN AN  ELECTION THIS WAY, THE SPLIT  POPULAR VOTE, YOU KNOW IT'S A  DIVIDED COMPANY. GEORGE W. BUSH DID A TREMENDOUS  JOB TO MAKE OUTREACH. APPOINTING A DEM TO THE CAB MET. THAT HADN'T BEEN DONE IN A  WHILE. I THINK DONALD TRUMP HAS GOTTEN  A LATE START HERE, HEWITT. I WONDER IF HE'LL BE THINKING  ABOUT THAT TODAY. >> I THINK THE APPOINTMENTS OF  GENERALS KELLY AND MATTIS BEING  NONPARTISAN ARE SIGNIFICANT. AND I THINK IF HE CONTINUES ON  WITH THE KEY OF WE IS WHAT I  THINK HE SHOULD SING IN TODAY IN THIS SHORT INAUGURAL ADDRESS. I THINK HE SHOULD BE INCLUSIVE  AND NOT DIVISIVE. 1789 IS THE FIRST INAUGURAL. IT TOOK 76 YEARS TO GET TO  LINCOLN'S SECOND, BY MOST  ACCOUNTS THE GREATEST INAUGURAL  SPEECH. 76 YEARS THEREAFTER, IT WAS  FDR'S THIRD INAUGURAL ON THE EVE OF WORLD WAR I AS BOMBS RAINED  DOWN. AND THEN '76 BRINGS US TO THIS. SO IT'S AN INTERESTING CYCLE AND IN EACH OF THOSE THREE ONES,  WASHINGTON, LINCOLN AND FDR'S  VERY INCLUSIVE TONE. SO I HOPE MR. TRUMP HITS THAT  TODAY. >> YOU WOULD NOT INCLUDE JFK IN  1960? >> RHETORICALLY VERY HIGH, BUT  NOT IN A MOMENT OF CRISIS IN THE WAY '41, LINCOLN'S SECOND  INAUGURAL --  >> IT'S INTERESTING YOU CALL ATE MOMENT OF CRISIS. YOU BROUGHT UP '09 VERSUS TODAY. SO IN '09, WE WERE IN THE  PROCESS OF A -- WE WERE IN THE  BRINK OF AN ECONOMIC DISASTER,  EXPERIENCING IT AT THE MOMENT. AT THE TIME, WE ALMOST WERE  LOSING A MILLION JOBS. THAT MONTH THAT BARACK OBAMA  TOOK THE OATH OF OFFICE. YET THIS TOWN, THIS CAPITAL,  THERE WAS A EUPHORIC ATMOSPHERE. THE ECONOMY FEELS BETTER. THE COUNTRY SEEMS ON ONE HAND  ECONOMICALLY MORE STABLE THAN IT WAS EIGHT YEARS AGO,ET THERE'S AN UNEASINESS. >> BUT THE EUPHORIA. LISTEN, I SPENT ALL LAST WEEK  COVERING TRUMP. THE EUPHORIA IS IN THE PLACES  WHERE THEY GOT THEIR GUY. THIS TOWN I WOULDN'T EXPECT TO  BE EUPHORIC. CERTAIN POCKETS IDENTITY WILL  SHE. BUT THE EUPHORIA WAS OUT IN  AMERICA WHERE THE EXPERIENCE WAS LIKE BREXIT, WHERE THIS WAS A  CELEBRATION AND VICTORY AGAINST  ELITE AGAINST THE ESTABLISHMENT  OF BOTH PARTIES. >> LET'S LISTEN IN HERE,  KELLYANNE CONWAY GREETING  PEOPLE. >> OH, I REMEMBER THAT. THAT IS VERY -- I DO REMEMBER  THAT. I DIDN'T SEE THE LETTER, BUT I  REMEMBER THAT. >> SHE IS JUST OUT OF MIKE  RANGE. >> THAT DEPENDS HOW GOOD YOUR  HEARING IS THERE. >> YOU MENTIONED EARLIER IN  1984. THE COLDEST ONE. I WAS HERE FOR THAT. EVERYONE WAS HAPPY, BOTH  REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS. >> THIS LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE ON  THE MOVE NOW. I'LL LET THE CONTROL ROOM  CONFIRM THAT FOR ME, BUT THIS  LOOKS LIKE --  >> I MISSED THE EXIT FROM THE  WHITE HOUSE. >> THE FIRST COUPLE AND THE SOON TO BE FIRST COUPLE RIDING  TOGETHER ALONG PENNSYLVANIA  AVENUE, MAKING THEIR WAY TO THE  CAPITOL. >> THE FACT IS --  >> STEPHANIE GOSK IS WITH A LOT  OF FOLKS, VERY EXCITED FOLKS WHO HAVE CROWDED ON THE MALL. STEPHANIE. >> HEY, LESTER, HOW ARE YOU? A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE GATHERED  OUT HERE TODAY. I'M HERE WITH A COUPLE OF  SISTERS FROM PITTSBURGH WHO  DECIDED THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO COME TO D.C. THIS IS THEIR FIRST  INAUGURATION. CARRIE, TELL ME WHY IT WAS  IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO BE HERE  TODAY. >> I BELIEVE IN MR. TRUMP AND I  BELIEVE IN WHAT HE'S TRYING TO  DO FOR THE COUNTRY. AND I THINK THAT WE NEEDED A  CHANGE AND I'M REALLY HOPING HE  DOES WHAT HE SAYS HE'LL DO. >> AND DANA, FOR YOU, WHAT WAS  IT ABOUT TRUMP THAT DREW YOU TO  HIM? >> I THINK THE FACT THAT HE WAS  NOT A POLITICIAN AND HE WAS  WILLING TO STEP UP AND DO THINGS THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVEN'T DONE. >> AND TELL ME A LITTLE BIT  ABOUT THIS, AS FIRST TIMERS, TO  BE IN WASHINGTON, D.C. ON  INAUGURATION DAY. WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE? >> IT'S REALLY EXCITING. I LOVE THE ATMOSPHERE. I JUST WISH WE COULD GET TO THE  MALL. THAT'S THE ONLY THING WE WISH. BUT --  >> YOU'VE GOT THE CAPITOL RIGHT  DOWN THERE. >> AND WE HAVE A GREAT VIEW FOR  THE PARADE, TOO. >> EXCELLENT. YOU WILL HAVE A BIRD'S-EYE VIEW  BECAUSE THE PARADE IS GOING TO  PASS RIGHT BY HERE. NICE TALKING TO YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> THANK YOU. >> LESTER, BACK TO YOU. >> ALL RIGHT, STEPHANIE, THANKS. WE ARE WATCHING THE PRESIDENTIAL MOTORCADE THERE JUST A FEW  MOMENTS AGO AS THEY MAKE THEIR  WAY HERE TO THE CAPITOL. THINGS GETTING UPPER WAY IN  ABOUT AN HOUR, THE ACTUAL  CEREMONY AND THE SWEARING THIS  WILL BE AROUND NOON EASTERN  TIME. >> VICE PRESIDENT, I THINK,  ACTUALLY GETS SWORN IN BEFORE  THE PRESIDENT. SO FOR A BRIEF MOMENT, I THINK  WE WILL TECHNICALLY HAVE  PRESIDENT OBAMA AND VICE  PRESIDENT PENCE. >> FOR A FEW MINUTES. >> A VERY BRIEF MOMENT. WE'LL TAKE A BREAK AND CONTINUE  WITH MORE OF OUR COVERAGE OF THE INAUGURATION >>> WELCOME BACK. THE WE HAVE THE FRONT OF THE  CAPITOL, WHICH WILL BE THE SITE  TRUMP AS THE 45th PRESIDENT OF  >> WHO KNEW HOW MANY THEY HAD. >> GM MAKES SPECIFICALLY WITH  THESE ARMOREDED DOORS  SPECIFICALLY. >> SO I WAS THINKING HOW DID WE  MIX THE EXIT, BUT WE DID NOT. ONE OTHER BIT OF BUSINESS, WE  SAW SENATOR SUSAN COLLINS  WALKING IN WITH A MEDICAL BOOT. >> SHE BROKE HER ANKLE, SLIPPED  ON ICE. IT'S MAINE. SLIPPED ON HER ICE IN DECEMBER,  BROKE HER ANKLE IN TWO PLACES. IT'S A TOUGH RECOVERY. YOU HAVE TO KEEP MOVING AND KEEP OFF YOUR FEET. GOOD LUCK WITH THAT AS A SMEERT. SENATOR. >> GOOD LUCK WITH THAT. WE DID WANT TO CLEAR THAT UP. >> ALWAYS IN SUCH A GREAT MOOD  AND OPTIMISTIC. >> IT IS JANUARY IN WASHINGTON  AND THAT CAN SOMETIMES MEAN  BRUTAL, BRUTAL COLD. WE DON'T QUITE HAVE THAT, BUT WE HAVE SOME DRIZZLE. AND AL ROKER IS WATCHING THE  WEATHER FOR US. WHAT IS IT GOING TO BE LIKE THE  NEXT FEW HOURS? >> WE ARE GOING TO SEE A VERY  QUICK SHOWER, LINE OF SHOWERS  MOVE THROUGH. RIGHT NOW, THINGS ARE DRY. THAT'S OKAY. WE'VE HAD SOME DRIZZLE, AS YOU  MENTIONED. TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE MID 40s. THAT'S NOT SO BAD, EITHER. AND WE ARE LOOKING, IN FACT, AS  WE CHECK OUT RIGHT NOW THE  RADAR, YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE IS A LINE BACK TO OUR WEST THAT IS  GOING TO BE PUSHING IN. WE'RE IN BETWEEN SHOWERS, AS YOU CAN SEE. SO AS THAT PUSHES THROUGH, IT'S  A FAST MOVER. THAT'S GREAT NEWS. SO BOOM, AS WE PUT THE FUTURE  CAST INTO MOTION, IT PUSHES  THROUGH. IT'S A FAST MOVING SYSTEM. AND THE GOOD NEWS IS, IT SHOULD  JUST ABOUT BE OUT OF HERE AS WE  LOOK AT THE FORECAST. THERE MAY BE A LINGERING  SPRINKLE OR TWO DURING THE  SWEARING IN CEREMONY. BUT THEN FOR THE PARADE AT 3:00, CLOUDY SKIES, COOL TEMPERATURES  IN THE MID 40s. BUT STILL TEMPERATURES NICE AND  SEASONAL. AND ALL IN ALL, IT'S GOING TO  BE -- THE WEATHER SHOULD NOT BE  A PROBLEM FOR EITHER THE  SWEARING IN OR FOR WHAT'S GOING  ON WITH THE PARADE AS IT MAKES  ITS WAY TOWARD THE WHITE HOUSE,  LESTER. >> THANKS SO MUCH. THERE'S A LINE OF FOLKS THERE. BOB DOLE HAS MADE HIS WAY TO THE CAPITOL. >> AND ELIZABETH DOLE. >> SHE LOOKS GREAT. >> EVERYTHING I'VE HEARD  RECENTLY ON BOB DOLE, HE'S BEEN  FEELING VERY GOOD. >> I'VE BEEN SPENDING A FAIR  AMOUNT OF TIME WITH HIM. HE'S WORKING VERY HARD ON THE  EISENHOWER MEMORIAL FOR THE  MALL, RAISING THE MONEY. THE FAMILY FINALLY HAS SIGNED  OFF ON THE DESIGN. >> THAT HAS TAKEN WAY TOO LONG. >> BUT THE FAMILY SIGNED OFF ON  THE DESIGN AND THE OLD WARRIOR  IS OUT THERE RAISING MONEY FOR  IT, TALKING TO EVERYBODY THAT HE CAN FIND. MRS. SENATOR DOLE, ELIZABETH  DOLE,S HAS CREATED A VERY GOOD  PROGRAM FOR SUPPORTING VETERANS' FAMILIES WHICH NEED A LOT OF  HELP. NOT JUST THE VETERANS  THEMSELVES, BUT THEY NEED HELP. SHE'S GOTTEN CONGRESS INVOLVED,  THE ""TODAY"" SHOW IS DEEPLY  INVOLVED IN IT. THESE TWO PEOPLE ARE PUBLIC  SERVANTS EVERY DAY OF THEIR  LIVES. >> MY FAVORITE THING ABOUT  SENATOR DOLE IS HE IS AS UP TO  DATE ON THE POLITICAL GOSSIP AS  ANYBODY. WHEN I INTERVIEWED HIM, HE HAD  ALREADY -- THAT DAY AND A COUPLE OF PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES WHO  WERE ABOUT TO ANNOUNCE HAD  ALREADY CALLED HIM. AS MR. REPUBLICAN, HE WAS THE  ONLY LIVING NOMINEE THAT SAID  I'M GOING TO THE CONVENTION. HE HAS BEEN VERY LOYAL TO THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY AND DONALD  TRUMP AS THE NOMINEE SINCE HE  GOT THE NOMNOMINATION. >> AND ALSO HIS CLIENT, OF  COURSE, WAS IN CHINA. >> TAIWAN. >> TAIWAN.. >> THAT'S TRUE. >> THAT WAS IMPORTANT. >> HE GOT SOMETHING THERE. >> LET ME SET THE SCENE WHAT  YOU'RE LOOKING AT ON THE LEFT  SIDE. THAT IS THE ENTRANCE TO THE  WHITE HOUSE WHERE WE EXPECT TO  SEE THE OBAMAS AND THE TRUMPS  EMERGE HERE SHORTLY FOR THE  SHORT TRIP UP TO CAPITOL HILL  FOR THE CAPITOL. THEY'RE ENJOYING WHAT IS A KEY  COFFEE AND TEA MOMENT. IT'S A FORMALITY THAT HAS BECOME A TRADITION ON THIS DAY. >> WE'RE WATCHING THE NEW CAB  THREAT ON THE RIGHT SIDE. YOU JUST SAW REX TILLERSON WALK  THROUGH.  >> SCOTT PRUITT. >> YEAH. SO WE'RE SEEING THE NEW  POTENTIAL CABINET, NOT ALL -- I  THINK WE WILL SEE AT LEAST TWO  OR THREE CONFIRMATIONS TODAY. GENERAL MATTIS MAY, OFFICIALLY  BY THE END OF THE DAY, MAY BE  THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE AND  JOHN KELLY MAY BE OFFICIALLY THE SECRETARY OF --  >> DR. BEN CARSON. >> YEAH. >> GARY COHEN. >> HE'S A NAME YOU HAVEN'T HEARD A LOT. HE'S GOING BE THE PRESIDENT'S  CHAIR OF THE ECONOMIC COUNCIL. HE HAS ALREADY SEEN -- HE HAS  REALLY EARNED THE TRUST, I'M  TOLD, OF THE INCOMING PRESIDENT  IN A WAY VERY QUICKLY, A REAL  MEMBER OF THAT INNER CIRCLE. YOU HEAR BAN NON, CONWAY,  KUSHNER, YOU'LL START HEARING  COHEN. >> HE WAS PRESIDENT OF THE  GOLDMAN SACHS, WHICH IS NOT  EXACTLY A CLUB THAT YOU PUT  TOGETHER OVERNIGHT. THAT WAS A BIG SOPHISTICATED  INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION. THEY BOTH ARE NEW YORKERS. THEY BOTH HAVE KIND OF THE SAME  TOUGH TOOUT ATTITUDE ABOUT HOW  YOU GET THINGS DONE. AND I ASKED HIM ABOUT HOW HE WAS DOING AND HE SAID, WELL, I THINK I'M REALLY MAKING PROGRESS. I'M TRYING IN SOME REGARDS TO  GET HIM NOT TO TWEET SO MUCH,  BUT I'M NOT AS SUCCESSFUL AS  THAT. >> HE'S NOT AN IDEALOGICAL GUY,  EITHER, JUST LIKE DONALD TRUMP. THAT'S WHERE YOU SEE A BONDING  THERE AND THE TWO OF THEM THINK  OF THEMSELVES AS DOERS. >> AND THAT WAS A CAMPAIGN  PROMISE. THAT WAS EXACTLY THE KIND OF  PERSON HE PROMISED TO POPULATE  HIS GOVERNMENT WITH. >> LET ME GET TO KATIE RIGHT NOW WHO IS AT THE CAPITOL. >> WE'RE AT THE FOOT OF THE DIAS WHERE DONALD TRUMP WILL TAKE THE OATH OF OFFICE. BEHIND ME, WE CAN SEE UNVICINGLY A SEA OF RED EMBLEMATIC HATS. I'M HERE WITH JIM AND PAM. THEY WERE FROM MARYLAND, A BLUE  STATE. SO HOW DID IT FEEL IN VOTING FOR TRUMP IN A STATE THAT WENT  TOWARDS HILLARY CLINTON? >> GREAT. IT WAS GREAT. TRYING TO MOVE THE NEEDLE IN A  LITTLE WAY. >> WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO HEAR  FROM TRUMP WHEN HE DELIVERS HIS  INAUGURAL SPEECH? >> HOW HE'S GOING TO UNITE THE  COMPANY AGAIN AND BRING US ALL  BACK TOGETHER. WHATEVER OUR DIFFERENCES, THIS  IS A GREAT DAY AND HE BRINGS US  TOGETHER AND MAKES OUR ECONOMY  BETTER AND BRINGS US TOGETHER. >> WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE THE  ISSUES THAT CAN UNITE YOU AND  YOUR FELLOW VOTERS WHO MAYBE  DIDN'T CAST THEIR VOTE FOR  DONALD TRUMP? >> TAX REFORM. LOWER THE TAXES, DONALD. >> ANYTHING ELSE? >> YEAH. JUST MAKE A BETTER BUSINESS  CLIMATE SO WE CAN ALL, YOU KNOW, MAYBE POSITIVE PER A LITTLE BIT  MORE THAN WE HAVE IN THE LAST  EIGHT YEARS. >> HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE  TRANSITION EFFORTS SO FAR? DO YOU THINK DONALD TRUMP HAS  MADE AN EFFORT TO UNITE THE  COUNTRY? DO YOU WANT TO SEE HIM DO A  LITTLE BIT MORE? >> I THINK HE HAS. I THINK IT WAS EVIDENT WITH THE  STREAM OF PEOPLE COMING IN FROM  TRUMP TOWERS, YOU COULD SEE HE  WAS REACHING ACROSS THE AISLES. AND I THINK HE HAS MADE A VERY  GOOD EFFORT TO TRY TO BRING OUR  COUNTRY TOGETHER. >> DID YOU WANT TO SEE A  DEMOCRAT IN THE CABINET? USUALLY PAST PRESIDENTS HAVE PUT A RIVAL IN THE CABINET. >> I WOULD NOT HAVE MINDED. IF HE FELT THERE WAS A QUALIFIED PERSON AND THEIR POLITICAL VOWS  WERE OF THAT PARTY, THAT WOULD  HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY FINE. >> PAM AND JIM FROM MARYLAND,  OBVIOUSLY A BLUE STATE, THANK  YOU SO MUCH. >> KATIE, THANK YOU SO MUCH. I JUST COMPLETED A WEEK-LONG  TOUR OF DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE  COUNTRY TALKING TO PEOPLE ABOUT  THE CHANGES COMING TO AMERICA. THEY ALL TALKED ABOUT THIS  NOTION OF BRINGING THE COUNTRY  BACK TOGETHER AND HEALING THESE  WOUNDS. BUT WHEN YOU PRESS PEOPLE, YOU  FIND THE DIVISIONS ARE STILL  PRETTY SHARP. AND YOU START TO WONDER. NICOLE, ARE WE ASKING TOO MUCH  OF ANY PRESIDENT TO BRING THE  COUNTRY TOGETHER? >> YEAH, LISTEN. I WAS ON A PARALLEL JOURNEY. YOU WENT NORTH AND I WENT SOUTH  AND I HEARD THE SAME THING. THEY ARE THRILLED TO HAVE BEEN  RIGHT. THEY HAVE THRILLED TO HAVE  PREVAILED AGAINST WHAT FELT  LIKE, YOU KNOW, AN ESTABLISHMENT POLITICAL CLASS, DEMOCRATIC AND  REPUBLICAN AND THE MEDIA THAT  WAS SORT OF GOING ALONG. SO THEY'VE THRILLED BY UPHEAVAL. BUT I THINK THEY WOULD LIKE TO  SEE HIM DO SOME OF THE MORE  TRADITIONAL THINGS. HE'S NOW THE LEADER OF THE FREE  WORLD AND THEY WANT HIM TO STOP  TWEETING AT UNION BOSSES. IF HE WANTS TO MAKE A POLICY  CASE ON TWITTER, THAT'S FINE,  BUT THEY WANT TO SEE HIM ACT A  LITTLE MORE PRESIDENTIAL. >> I ALSO SAW THE DIVISION WAS  NOT JUST A ALONG IDEAAL  POLITICAL LINES. LVS THE DIVISION OVER CHARACTER. SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT  SUPPORTED HIM ACKNOWLEDGE SOME  OF THE OFFENSIVE THINGS HE HAD  SAID AND DONE ALONG THE WAY, BUT SAID THAT'S NOT WHY THEY WERE  VOTING. BUT OTHER PEOPLE COULDN'T GET  PAST THAT, EVEN AS THEY MIGHT  AGREE ON POLICY ISSUES. >> I'VE HEARD FROM PARENTS ON  THIS A LOT. I'LL BE HONEST, IN MY OWN  NEIGHBORHOOD, I'VE HEARD FROM  PARENTS AND TEACHERS ON THIS  ISSUE. I HAVE TO SAY, THAT IS SOMETHING THAT, LOOK, I THINK -- I THINK B VICE PRESIDENT PENCE CAN HAVE A  LOT OF INFLUENCE ON HIM. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  IS A ROLE MODEL THAT ALL PARENTS WANT TO FEEL COMFORTABLE  POINTING TO. AND THAT IS SOMETHING AND I  THINK YOU NEED TO MAKE AN EFFORT ON. I THINK VICE PRESIDENT PENCE  WILL TRY TO PUSH HIM IN THAT  DIRECTION. >> TO POINT OUT, WE'RE LOOKING  AT THE MEMBERS OF THE SUPREME  COURT AS THEY'RE WALKING IN. >> FOR PARENTS WHO DID VOTE FOR  HIM, I WENT OUT AND TALKED TO  MOWERS BEFORE THE  ELECTION .AFTER. THEY SAID THEY WEREN'T ASKING  HIM TO RAISE THEIR CHILDREN,  THAT WAS THEIR JOB. SO IT DIVIDED PARENTS ON BOTH  SIDES OF THE TRUMP TEELD. >> THERE'S AN OPTIMISM HERE THAT I WISH PEOPLE WOULD GET. I THINK ABOUT THE LAST TEN  YEARS. WITH THE ELECTION OF BARACK  OBAMA, THERE WAS A GROUP OF  AMERICANS THAT THOUGHT, OH, MY  GOD, MY VOICE CAN BE HEARD. IN THIS ELECTION, YOU RAN B INTO PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT, OH, NO, I  HAVE BEEN HEARD. LET'S LOOK AT IT FROM 30,000  FEET OVER THE LAST DECADE AND  ALL AMERICANS HAVE FELT AS IF  THEIR VOICE CAN GET HEARD AT THE BALLOT BOX. THAT'S THE UP SIDE OF ALL OF  THIS. IT IS NOW ON THE SHOULDERS OF  OUR LEADERS, BOTH THE NEXT  PRESIDENT, TRUMP, AS WELL AS IT  WAS WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA TO SORT OF GRAB THAT AND --  >> AND GROW IT, YEAH. >> THAT IS WHERE THERE IS  COMMONALITY BETWEEN OBAMA AND  TRUMP. THEY BOTH CAME IN AS OUTSIDERS. IS THERE A WAY TO FORGE THAT, A  SUCCESSFUL POLITICIAN. IF DONALD TRUMP CAN LEARN TO BE  A SUCCESSFUL POLITICIAN, HE'LL  DO THAT, HUGH. >> YEAH. THE MOST INTRACTABLE INSTITUTION IS THE SENATE. WE HAD A BRIEF PICTURE OF MITCH  McCONNELL WHOS HAS WAITED FOR  HIS ENTIRE POLITICAL LIFE FOR A  UNIFIED REPUBLICAN PARTY --  >> HERE IS SENATOR SCHUMER NOW. . >> IF CHUCK SCHUMER AND MITCH  McCONNELL CAN MAKE THE  INSTITUTION WORK WITH THIS MOST  NUR PRESIDENT, THAT WOULD BE  VERY OPTIMISTIC. >> YOU KNOW, THE IRONY COULD BE  THAT THE WAY THAT DIRKSON AND  LBJ HAD A BIPARTISAN  RELATIONSHIP, AND DIRKSON AND  LBJ WERE CLOSER THAN SOME OF THE SENATE DEMOCRATS, SCHUMER MAY  HAVE A BETTER RELATIONSHIP WITH  McCONNELL. >> MAY BE. FOR THOSE THAT DON'T REMEMBER  THE NAME OF EVERT DIRKSON, HE  WAS A SENATE MAJORITY LEADER. THEY DISAGREED WITH ALMOST  EVERYTHING, BUT THEY WOULD HORSE TRADE AROUND THE CLOCK. >> THEY MIGHT BE WORKING  TOGETHER ON INFRASTRUCTURE, FOR  EXAMPLE. THERE'S GOING TO BE A TENSION  HERE. THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, THE BASE  WANTS TO RESIST. THE BASE WANTS TO FIGHT. >> ELIZABETH WARREN HERE. >> SPEAKING OF FIGHTERS. >> AND I THINK SHE FEELS THAT  PRESSURE. YOU CAN SEE IN THIS  CONFIRMATION. THIS IS GOING TO BE CHUCK  SCHUMER'S CHALLENGE. >> SIMULTANEOUSLY, THE  DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS TO DECIDE  WHAT IT WANTS TO BE. THAT WILL BE A VERY IMPORTANT  PART OF THIS AS THEY GO FORWARD. I SAW A YOUNG DEMOCRAT TODAY WHO LOST IN THIS ELECTION CYCLE AND  I SAID WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? AND HE SAID WE'RE KIND OF AT SEA AT THIS POINT. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, THERE ARE THINGS THAT THEY CAN DO  TOGETHER, BUT THE DIRKSON/LBJ,  THEY HAD SERVED IN THE SENATE  TOGETHER. THEY SPOKE EACH OTHER'S  LANGUAGE. >> BUT SCHUMER AND TRUMP SPEAK  NEW YORK. >> EXACTLY. >> THAT'S AN IMPORTANT LANGUAGE. >> BUT SCHUMER HAS A DIFFERENT  DEMOCRATIC PARTY BEHIND HIM AT  THAT POINT. >> AND HERE IS, AGAIN, SUPREME  COURT JUSTICE ROBERTS WHO WILL  BE ADMINISTERING THE OATH. YOU SEE JUSTICE THOMAS THERE WHO WILL BE --  >> AND WE HOPE HE GETS IT RIGHT  THIS TIME. >> AND IN THE MIDDLE, LITERALLY  AND FIGURATIVELY IS JUSTICE  KENNEDY WHO IS ASSUMING WE KNOW  WHERE THE VACANCY GOES WITH  PRESIDENT TRUMP'S EVENTUAL APPOINTEE PUTS KENNEDY RIGHT  SMACK IN THE MIDDLE --  >> TOM'S MEMORY OF THE CHIEF  JUSTICE BOTCHING UP THE OATH  EIGHT YEARS AGO, THEY HAD TO  READMINISTER IT TO PRESIDENT  OBAMA THE NEXT DAY. >> I'M GUESSING HE'S NOT GOING  TO TRY TO DO IT FROM MEMORY ANY  MORE. >> HOW QUICK DO YOU ALL THINK  THAT THE PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL BE MOVING ON THE SUPREME COURT  PICK? >> HE PROMISED VERY QUICKLY. BY THE WAY, I WOULDN'T DAWDLE IF I REMEMBER HIM POLITICALLY. THIS IS SOMETHING WITH  CONFIRMATIONS AND ALL THIS  STUFF, GET IT DONE EARLY. IT'S GOING TO BE A PAINFUL  PROCESS, TOO, LILY. AND YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE THAT  LINGER. >> HERE IS THE TRUMP FAMILY NOW. >> IT'S VERY UNUSUAL, JARED  KUSHNER, WHO IS THE SON-IN-LAW  AND A VERY SUCCESSFUL NEW YORK  BUSINESSMAN IS GOING TO BE IN  THE WHITE HOUSE WITH AN OFFICIAL ROLE. THE QUESTION THEN IS, WHO WILL  LISTEN TO HIM BEGIN, THE  PRESIDENT. >> KRISTEN WELKER IS NOW LOOKING DOWN AT THE VIP ARRIVALS. >> STRIKING TO SEE THE TRUMP  FAMILY MEMBERS ARRIVE, LESTER. IT'S ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS, I  THINK, FOR EVERYONE HERE THAT IT STARTS TO FEEL INCREASINGLY MORE REAL. ANOTHER VIP WHO WE JUST WATCHED  ENTER. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS AND SORT  OF REMINDS EVERYONE OF HOW HARD  FOUGHT THIS RACE WAS. HE IS, OF COURSE, THE FORMER  RIVAL OF HILLARY CLINTON DURING  THE PRIMARY. WE ARE HIGHLY ANTICIPATING HER  ENTRANCE AS YOU WERE DISCUSSING  EARLIER. THIS WILL BE THE FIRST TIME THAT SHE AND PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD  TRUMP ARE IN THE THE SAME SPACE  SINCE THAT BITTER CAMPAIGN. SO THERE ARE GOING TO BE A LOT  OF EYES FOCUSED ON HER, AS WELL. PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS TALKED SO  MUCH ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER AND  THAT'S SOMETHING THAT REALLY  MATTERS TO THE CLINTONS, AS  WELL. SO, OF COURSE, THEY ARE HERE  BECAUSE OF FORMER PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON, BUT THEY THINK THIS IS  PART OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO  THIS DEMOCRACY. WE'VE SEEN A NUMBER OF OTHER  VIPs ARRIVE AND THAT WILL  CONTINUE. 1600 IN ALL ON THIS PLATFORM,  LESTER. >> AS WE CONTINUE TO WATCH FOLKS MAKE THEIR WAY, WE'RE KEEPING A  CLOSE EYE ON THE LEFT SIDE OF  YOUR SCREEN WHERE THE OBAMAS AND TRUMPS WILL BE EMERGING SHORTLY. SENATOR TED CRUZ THERE WHO WAGED HIS OWN BATTLE AGAINST DONALD  TRUMP FOR THE REPUBLICAN  NOMINATION. BUT HAS CLIMBED ON BOARD AND  SAID TODAY HE'S VERY EXCITED  ABOUT WHAT'S TO COME IN  WASHINGTON. >> BY THE WAY, SAW JARED KUSHNER THERE, THE SON-IN-LAW. ANOTHER INTERESTING THING, HE  COMES FROM A FAMILY THAT HAS  DEEP DEMOCRATIC PARTY TIES. HIS FATHER WAS ONE OF THE  BIGGEST AND MOST IMPORTANT  DONORS AND SUPPORTERS OF A  FORMER DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR OF  NEW JERSEY NAMED JIM McGREEVY. SO THERE ARE NONIDEALOGICAL  PEOPLE AND THAT WILL BE AN  INTERESTING DYNAMIC IN THE BASE  OF YOUR PARTY. >> I AGREE. I SAW SCOTT WALKER EARLIER TODAY AND REINCE PRIEBUS ARRIVING. AT THE SAME TIME, JARED KUSHNER  AND IVANKA TRUMP ARE NOT KNOWN  FOR BEING IDEALOGICAL. I THINK IT'S AN INTERESTING  WHITE HOUSE. MAY BE THE MOST INTERESTING  SINCE REAGAN BROUGHT --  >> HERE COMES PRT PRESIDENT AND  ROSELYN CARTER. >> PRESIDENT CARTER FLEW HER  COMMERCIALLY, BY THE WAY. >> IN COACH. >> AND SHOOK EVERYBODY'S HAND. TALK ABOUT MEDICAL RECOVERIES,  TOM. >> OH, MY GOD. >> I MEAN, HOW ABOUT THIS? >> IT IS -- I MEAN, HE'S CANCER  FREE. AND THE FACT IS, IT'S A TRIBUTE  TO FARM LIFE. >> RURAL LIFE, BOTH DICK CHENEY  AND JIMMY CARTER. >> CHUCK, WE'RE IN TROUBLE. >> IT'S ALSO A TRIBUTE TO HIS  FAITH HE WILL TELL YOU. >> AND HIS WIFE. >> YES, THEY'RE VERY, VERY  STRONG. I SAW HER AT NANCY REAGAN'S  FUNERAL AND I HADN'T SEEN HER  FOR A WHILE, BUT --  >> MARCO RUBIO. >> A YOUNG MAN WITH A FUTURE,  MARCO RUBIO. BUT ANYHOW, JIMMY CARTER HAS  BEEN -- IN TERMS OF HIS INTEREST AROUND THE WORLD, HOW HE DOES  IT. THE CARTER ORGANIZATION IS  EXTREMELY ORGANIZED. >> AND POSITIVE. I'VE INTERVIEWED HIM ON A B  NUMBER OF OCCASIONES AND WHAT A  GREAT OUTLOOK ON LIFE. THIS IDEALOGICAL QUESTION IS SO  INTERESTING. HALF OF THE COUNTRY IS ELATED  AND THE OTHER HALF IS BEYOND  DESPAIR. A LOT OF PEOPLE IN MY TWITTER  FEED, OH, I CAN'T WATCH. SORRY, I'LL TUNE IN NEXT WEEK. THIS IS -- THIS IMPULSE IN  DONALD TRUMP TO NOT BE  IDEALOGICAL COULD BE A RAY OF  HOPE. HE HAS SAID KIND THINGS ABOUT  PLANNED PARENTHOOD. HE HAS SAID THINGS MORE CLOSELY  ALIGNED WITH DEMOCRATS ON TRADE, ON INFRASTRUCTURE, ON FOREIGN  POLICY. SO IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF JARED KUSHNER TAKES ON THE  ROLE OF PROTECTING THE  PRESIDENT'S IMPULSES AND  INSTINCTS AND PRESERVING THOSE  PLACES WHERE HE DOESN'T WANT TO  FALL IN LINE BEHIND REPUBLICAN  ORTHODOXY OR WHETHER HE TRIES TO SORT OF ROUND OFF THOSE EDGES  AND MOVE HIM CLOSER TO THE  REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT. >> HE'S A POPULIST THROUGH AND  THROUGH. HE'S A POPULIST THROUGH AND  THROUGH. HE HAS AN EAR. CHRIS MATTHEWS HAS A GREAT LINE  ABOUT HIM. HE THINKS DONALD TRUMP HAS THE  BEST EAR GOING RIGHT NOW IN  POLITICS. AND THE PERSON THAT HELPS HIM  WITH THAT HERE, JARED KUSHNER,  STEVE BANNON WHO IS NOT  IDEALOGICAL. >> WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE THE  OBAMAS AND TRUMPS SHORTLY. >> KEEP TRACK OF THE BIDENS. I THINK JOE BIDEN WILL BE THE  DEMOCRAT THAT SPEAKS OUT THE  MOST FOR A WHILE, MORE SO  THAN -- IN THE SAME WAY IF YOU  REMEMBER FORMER VICE PRESIDENT  DICK CHENEY DID, FOR THE FIRST  YEAR AS THE REPUBLICANS ARE  SEARCHING FOR A LEADER, I HAVE A FEELING BIDEN IS GOING TO FILL  THAT VACUUM FOR A LITTLE WHILE. >> I HAVE A PERSONAL HOPE. I HOPE HE'LL SAY, AS WELL, AND  LAUNCH FOR CANCER. HE'S DEEPLY COMMITTED AND HE'S  WORKED VERY HARD. THERE'S A CONTRAST FOR YOU RIGHT THERE, BERNIE SANDERS AND JIM -- >> AND THAT WAS KAREN PENCE WE  SAW WALK OUT WITH DR. BIDEN. HERE NOW, THE FIRST LADY AND THE SOON TO BE FIRST LADY. >> THIS IS THE STUFF I LOVE AS A HISTORY JUNKY. I LOVE THAT SPLIT SCREEN WE WERE SHOWING. IT'S LIVING HISTORY, FOLKS. >> AND READING THE EXPRESSIONS  OF BODY LANGUAGE. FIGURING OUT WHAT WAS SAID WIND  THE SCENES. >> DON'T YOU PUT YOUR OWN  THOUGHT BUBBLES ON THERE? RIGHT. >> LET'S REMEMBER THAT MELANIA  TRUMP CAME HERES AS AN  IMMIGRANT, MARRIED DONALD TRUMP  AND IS NOW GOING TO BECOME THE  FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES. THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN ANYWHERE  ELSE IN THE WORLD. AND YOU HAVE TO KEEP THAT IN  MIND. >> AND WE'RE WAITING FOR  PRESIDENT OBAMA AND  PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP. BUT FIRST --  >> AND THEIR MATCHING BLUE TIES  ALMOST. >> VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN AND SOON TO BE VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE. >> THEY'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER. THEY WERE BOTH IN HAD CONGRESS  AND JOE BIDEN HAS A GOOD REGARD  FOR HIM. >> AND IT'S NOT PER FUNTORY. THEY HAVE SPENT TEEN AMOUNTS OF  TIME FOR HIM. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN GIVING HIS  OWN TOUR OF THE WORLD TO THE  NEXT VICE PRESIDENT. >> I HEARD ANOTHER ONE OF DONALD TRUMP'S POLITICAL HAD A VERY  GOOD MEETING WITH VALLEY JARRETT WHO GAVE HIM A BRIEF ON WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT AND WHAT THE  DIFFICULTIES ARE. >> ONE THING THAT MIGHT BE SAID, WE'VE HEARD A LOT IN THIS  CAMPAIGN ABOUT TECHNOLOGY AND  WHAT THAT DOES TO PEOPLE'S JOB  ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY. JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE  PACE OF TECHNOLOGY, A HUNDRED  YEARS AGO, THIS YEAR, WOODROW  WILSON WAS ININAUGURAL RATED FOR A SECOND TERM AND HE CAME OUT OF THAT DOOR AND GOT INTO A HORSE  DRAWN CARRIAGE AND RODE UP TO  THE TO THE CAPITOL. THAT WAS JUST A HUNDRED YEARS  AGO. >> HERE THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN AND HERE IS PRESIDENT OBAMA AND  PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD TRUMP. HE ARRIVED IN AN ARMORED TOUGH. HE'S ABOUT TO STEP INTO WHAT IS  KNOWN AS THE PRESIDENTIAL BEAST, THE ARMORED LIMB KNOW SEEN. HE ARRIVED IN WASHINGTON ON AN  AIR FORCE PLANE, NOT HIS PRIVATE 757. SO IT IS ALL BECOMING VERY, VERY REAL. IT'S SMALL STEPS. ABOUT AN HOUR FROM NOW, ONE  LARGE STEP WITH THE SWEARING IN. >> THOSE TIES MEAN THEY'RE THE  LEADER OF RED AND BLUE AMERICA. >> PRESIDENT CLINTON AND  SECRETARY HILLARY CLINTON. >> BUT THEIR WIVES ARE WEARING  THE REVERSE, SO THERE YOU HAVE  IT. >> OUTREACH. OUTREACH. >> SO MICHAEL, HAVE WE HEARD ANY STORIES ALONG THE WAY OF WHAT  OCCURS IN THIS SHORT CAR RIDE? >> USUALLY PEOPLE GETTING ALONG  PRETTY WELL. AND THAT WAS PARTICULARLY THE  CASE IN THE FIRST ONE OF THESE  WHICH WAS 1837 WHICH ANDREW  JACKSON WAS RIDING WITH THE NEW  PRESIDENT WHO HAPPENED TO BE HIS VICE PRESIDENT, MARTIN VAN  BUREN. THEY WERE ON GREAT TERMS. BUT IT HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN THAT  WAY. FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT DEFEATED  PRESIDENT HERBERT HOOVER, 1933. THEY RODE UP TO THE CAPITAL. ROOSEVELT KEPT TRYING TO ENGAGE  HOOVER IN CONVERSATION AND  HOOVER WAS SO DEPRESSED HE  BARELY SPOKE. FINALLY, ROOSEVELT WAS REDUCED  TO SAYING LOOK AT THAT BUILDING  BEING BUILT OVER THERE. WHAT WONDERFUL STEAL. >> AS WE LOOK AT THIS PICTURE,  OF HILLARY CLINTON, YOUR MIND  JUST CAN'T HELP GO THERE TO WHAT SHE'S THINKING. SHE AND SO MANY PEOPLE WHO  THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE HER DAY. >> UH-HUH. >> AND AT THE SAME TIME, WHAT AN IMPORTANT SYMBOL THIS IS OF -- I KEEP COMING BACK TO THIS  PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER. >> AND LET'S NOT BEAT AROUND THE BUSH. I DON'T KNOW IF SHE'S OVER IT. I KNOW IT TOOK HER A LONG TIME. I KNOW THAT -- AND I DON'T THINK SHE IS IN SOME RESPECTS. >> YOU CAN'T --  >> ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU PICK UP  YOUR ""NEW YORK TIMES"" TODAY AND  YOU SEE THAT STORY ABOUT THE  IDEA THAT THE RUSSIAN  INVESTIGATION CONTINUES. AND EVERY TIME ONE OF THOSE  STORIES HITS, YOU HEAR THROUGH  THAT GRAPEVINE THAT IT STINGS. >> SHE GOT MORE VOTES THAN ANY  LOSING CANDIDATE IN HISTORY,  ALMOST 3 MILLION MORE IN THE  POPULAR VOTE. AND YOU'RE RIGHT, IT'S GOT TO  STING. >> HER CHOICE WILL BE VERY  INTERESTING HOW SHE LIVES THE  NEXT FOUR YEARS AND WHAT SHE  DECIDES TO INVOLVE HERSELF IN  THE POLITICS OF THE DAY. AND NO CLUES YET, I DON'T  BELIEVE, FROM ANYONE AS TO HOW  SHE INTENDS TO DO THAT. >> AND THE MOTORCADE IS ON THE  MOVE NOW, LEAVING THE WHITE  HOUSE GROUNDS, MAKING THE SHORT  DRIVE TO THE CAPITOL WHERE A  VERY SHORT TIME FROM NOW, DONALD TRUMP WILL BECOME THE NEXT  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THERE'S FORMER PRESIDENT BUSH. LAURA BUSH. >> YOU KNOW, THE BUSHES AND THE  CLINTONS HAVE BECOME FRIENDS. ONE THING THAT MIGHT MAKE IT A  LITTLE EASIER TODAY ON THE  CLINTONS IS THAT FRIENDSHIP HE  BETWEEN GEORGE W. BUSH AND LAURA BUSH AND THE CLINTONS AND, YOU  KNOW, I SAID THIS BEFORE. NONE OF THE FORMER PRESIDENTS ON THAT STAGE WILL HAVE VOTED FOR  DONALD TRUMP. SO --  >> WHEN YOU SAID THAT BEFORE,  NICOLE, I HAVE TO SAY, IT WAS  SORT OF LIKE WAS A WONDERFUL  OBSERVATION, BUT IT HIT ME LIKE  A SLEDGEHAMMER. I MEAN, IT DID. THIS IS WHY I THINK THERE HAS  BEEN A DIFFICULT TIME TO UNIFY  THE POLITICAL WORLD AROUND THIS  MOMENT. AND PROBABLY VERY HEALTHY,  BECAUSE I THINK THE PEOPLE THAT  VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP AND PUT  HIM HAD OVER THE EDGE WANTED A  SHAKE UP OF ESTABLISHMENT  POLITICS, NOT JUST REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT. >> A BIG, BIG PIECE OF WHY THEY  VOTED FOR HIM, QUITE HONESTLY,  GOING BY THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT NOW. ON THEIR WAY TO -- WE'LL BE  LOOKING AT THE WEST SIDE OF THE  CAPITOL, WHICH WAS THE RONALD  REAGAN ININKNOW VACATION INVASI  INNOVATION FOR THIS DAY. >> THIS IS A ROUND TRIP FOR  DONALD TRUMP. THE NEXT TIME, HE WILL BE GOING  IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND  WILL BE PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. >> I MUST SAY AS A REPORTER, I  WAS NEVER IN THERE, BUT I WOULD  GO AS PART OF THE POOL TO THE  CAPITOL FOR THE STATE OF THE  UNION ADDRESS. IT WAS VERY EXCITING. IT WAS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT  YOU LOOK AROUND AND SAY, WOW, I  PICKED THE RIGHT PROFESSION  AFTER ALL. ALL THE EXCITEMENT OF GOING UP  TO THE CAPITOL, THE  ANTICIPATION, AND YOU'RE IN THE  PRESIDENTIAL LIMOUSINE. I'VE RIDDEN WITH PRESIDENTS  BEFORE IN THE BACK AND YOU'RE  KNEE TO KNEE WITH THE SECRET  SERVICE, AS WELL. THEY SLIP IN AND THEY'VE GOT A  JUMP SEAT. >> IT'S NOT AS PRIVATE AS YOU'RE THINKING. >> AND BY THE WAY, IN A MOMENT,  HE WILL BE PASSING HIS NEW  HOTEL, WHICH WAS I BELIEVE HIS  FIRST STOP WHEN HE ARRIVED IN  WASHINGTON YESTERDAY. >> YOU GUYS ARE TALKING ABOUT  THE LIMO. IT'S CALLED ""THE BEAST"" BECAUSE  IT'S SO HEAVY. WHEN THEY FLY OVERSEAS, THEY  HAVE TO TAKE THE BEAST WITH  THEM. >> I UNDERSTAND TO STEP INSIDE  THE ONE THAT PRECEDED THIS ONE,  WHEN THAT DOOR CLOSES, THERE'S  A -- AND YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE -- >> IT'S THIS THICK. >> TAMRON HALL IS RIGHT BY THE  TRUMP HOTEL. TAMRON. >> HEY THERE. WE ARE RIGHT BY THE TRUMP HOTEL. WITHIN A FEW MINUTES HERE, WE  SHOULD SEE WHAT YOU ARE  REFERRING TO AS THE BEAST  CARRYING THE PRESIDENT-ELECT AND PRESIDENT OBAMA. THE NEXT ROUTE BACK FROM THE  CAPITOL, DONALD TRUMP WILL BE  THE 45th PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WITH HIS HOTEL PERHAPS  BEING THE FIRST TIME THAT THE  PRESIDENT STEPS OUT TO GREET  SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST  TO MY LEFT WHO HAVE EXTRA TEEJ  LICK PLACED THEMSELVES IN FRONT  OF TRUMP HOTEL, FORMERLY THE  MAIN POST OFFICE FOR WASHINGTON, D.C. I'M NOT HEARING CHEERS HERE. SO AS THE MOTORCADE PASSES WITH  THE PRESIDENT-ELECT, HIS FAMILY, SOON TO BE FIRST LADY, AS WELL. WE SEE DR. JILL BIDEN THERE AND  THERE IS MELANIA TRUMP WITH  FIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA. AND YOU SEE THERE MIKE PENCE. I'M TRYING TO STEP OUT OF THE  WAY SO YOU CAN SEE MORE HERE AND THERE YOU HAVE IT. THE PRESIDENT-ELECT AND THE  CURRENT PRESIDENT HEADED NOW TO  OUR NATION'S CAPITOL. WHEN THEY MAKE THIS OUR WIN, THE ROUTE RETURNS, WE WILL HAVE  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. >> AND TAMRON, IN THAT HOTEL,  NOT A SMALL MATTER IN THE  BROADER CONVERSATION ABOUT  POTENTIAL CONFLICTS THAT THIS  PRESIDENT WILL FACE FROM THE  MOMENT HE TAKES THE OATH. >> THERE'S A REASON THEY CAN'T  DO A DIRECT SHOT OF PEP PEN  AVENUE OF MICHAEL AND DOES SHE  IT HAS TO DO WITH THE PRESIDENT  THAT MAYBE DONALD TRUMP IS MOST  MODELLED AFTER, ANDREW JACKSON. >> AND HE DID SO MUCH TO CHANGE  THIS CAPITOL. THAT'S THE ARGUMENT THAT PEOPLE  MAKE, THIS IS THE NEW ANDREW  JACKSON AND THERE IS A LOT ABOUT ANDREW JACKSON, I GUARANTEE YOU, THAT DOES NOT REMIND US VERY  MUCH OF DONALD TRUMP BUT ONE  THING DOES. THAT IS THAT JACKSON IS THE ONE  WHO SAID ESSENTIALLY ELECT ME  AND I WILL END THIS PERSON IN  WHICH THE WHITE HOUSE HAS BEEN  HELD BY THE ELITES. THE ARISTOCRATS. I WILL BRING IN THE COMMON  PEOPLE TO THE POINT THAT ON  INAUGURATION DAY THEY OPEN THE  WHITE HOUSE TO EVERYONE THAT  CAME IN AND TRASHED THE PLACE  AND BROKE THE FURNITURE. >> OH, APPARENTLY THE TRUMP  TRANSITION, AT LEAST INQUIRED  ABOUT DOING SOMETHING SIMILAR. THERE IS AN AFFINITY FOR  JACKSON. >> THEY WERE BREAKING THE  WINDOWS AND HAVING RIOTS ON THE  LAWN. >> EXACTLY. WE SAW A PICTURE A MOMENT AGO OF THE CROWDS PASSING BY. IMAGINE WHAT LIFE IS LIKE AS A  PRESIDENT. YOUR WHOLE VIEW ON THE GROUNDS  IS IN A MOTORCADE. AND EVERYWHERE YOU GO, YOU WILL  SEE PEOPLE WAVING. YOU WILL SEE CROWDS GATHERED. I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF POOEM  BEING IN THE OBAMA MOTORCADE A  COUPLE OF TIMES LAST WEEK. WE WERE WORKING ON OUR INTERVIEW ABOUT HIS LEGACY. AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS  THAT STRUCK ME, EIGHT YEARS. THAT'S HOW YOU SEE THE WORLD. YOU'RE IN A WORLD, THERE'S NO  SUCH THING AS A STOP LIGHT,  THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS WAITING IN LINE. >> AFTER 9/11 AND TSA STARTED  MAKING YOU TAKE YOUR SHOES OFF,  GEORGE BUSH WAS ALREADY  PRESIDENT, OBVIOUSLY. AND I RAN INTO THE OVAL OFFICE,  I WAS LATE. I SAID MY FLIGHT WAS LATE. IT TAKES FOREVER NOW TO TAKE OFF YOUR SHOES. THANKS A LOT FOR THAT, MR.  PRESIDENT. HE SAID WHAT ARE YOU TALKING  ABOUT? I SAID THE GOSH BLEEP BLEEP TSA  MAKES YOU STRIP NAKED AND  BECAUSE OF YOU -- YOU KNOW, YOU  DO LIVE IN THIS RAREFIED --  WELL, HE KNEW BUT HE HADN'T  EXPERIENCED IT. >> AND NO ONE FAULTS HIM FOR IT. >> RIGHT. IT'S FOR YOUR OWN SECURITY. BUT IN MARINE ONE, YOU TAKE A  HELICOPTER TO GO TO AN AIRPORT. TO GO TO NEW YORK CITY. YOU LAND ON WALL STREET. AND YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT TRAFFIC  AND THEY LOOK AT YOU LIKE YOU'RE CRAZY. >> DWIGHT EISENHOWER, WHEN HE  LEFT THE PRESIDENCY, WENT BACK  TO HIS HOUSE, PICKED UP THE  TELEPHONE AND HEARD THIS BUZZ,  WHICH WAS A DIAL TONE. HE HAD NEVER HEARD ONE. FOR THE PREVIOUS 20 YEARS, HE  WOULD PICK UP THE TELEPHONE,  THERE WOULD BE AN OPERATOR AND  HE WOULD SAY, GET ME JOE SMITH. >> THE OTHER THING IS THAT  DONALD TRUMP HAS HAD MORE THAN A LITTLE EXPERIENCE RIDING IN A  LIMOUSINE. >> CORRECT. AND A PRIVATE AIRPLANE. >> AND A PRIVATE AIRPLANE. >> WELL, NO, THAT IS A CONCERN  THAT ACTUALLY SOME FOLKS AROUND  TRUMP HAVE THAT, YOU KNOW, HE  DOES -- SHEER A GUY THAT WAS  ELECTED SUPPOSEDLY HAVING THIS  COMMON TOUCH, BUT HE ACTUALLY  DOESN'T INTERACT THAT MUCH,  HASN'T. WILL INTERACT EVEN LESS SO AS  PRESIDENT JUST BECAUSE OF THE  NATURE OF SORT OF THE WAY THE -- >> THERE'S GOVERNOR CHRIS  CHRISTIE WHO WAS SEEN AS QUITE A WHILE FOR BEING A POTENTIAL  RISING STAR AND HAVING SOME  MAJOR ROLE IN THIS  ADMINISTRATION. >> THE TRANSITION PROCESS IS  SORT OF A MESS WITH A LOT OF  FINGER POINTING. SOME IN CHRIS CHRISTIE'S  DIRECTION .SOME SUPPORTERS OF  CHRIS CHRISTIE IN THE OTHER  DIRECTION. >> HE RAN THE PROCESS FOR A YEAR AND HAD AN OFFICE DOWN HERE AND  A STAFF. AND TWO DAYS AFTER DONALD TRUMP  WON, HE FIRED CHRIS CHRISTIE  FROM THAT JOB AND BASICALLY  STARTED THE WORK ANEW. >> WE WERE LOOKING AT THE  PICTURE OF HILLARY CLINTON A  MOMENT AGO. SHE TWEETED HERE RECENTLY, SHE  SAID I'M HERE TODAY TO HONOR OUR DEMOCRACY AND ITS ENDURING  VALUES. I WILL NEVER STOP BELIEVING IN  OUR COUNTRY AND ITS FUTURE,  #INAUGURATION. SO IF THE YOU'RE WONDERING  WHAT'S ON HER MIND, THAT WAS THE TWEET SHE ISSUED A SHORT TIME  AGO AS WE SEE PRESIDENT AND  LAURA BUSH MAKING THEIR WAY DOWN AND BEING GREETED BY FOLKS. >> AND HER TWEET ECHOS THE WORDS OF AL GORE WHEN HE CONCEDED THE  ELECTION OF 2000 WHEN HE SAID  FOR THE SAKE OF MY DEMOCRACY WIN OFFER MY CONCESSION. >> AND OUR THOUGHTS WITH  PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH WHO  REMAINS HOSPITALIZED IN HOUSTON  AFTER A HEALTH CARE THIS WEEK. BUT OBVIOUSLY --  >> WE'VE HEARD NOTHING BUT GOOD  NEWS FROM JENNA EARLIER TODAY ON THE ""TODAY"" SHOW. SO WE'RE VERY EXCITED TO HEAR  THAT. >> OBVIOUSLY, THE SITUATION IS  SUCH THAT PRESIDENT BUSH COULD  MAKE THIS JOURNEY. >> I'M SURE THEY'RE WATCHING. >> AND HERE IS THE ARRIVAL OF  THE MOTORCADE NOW TO THE CAPITOL WHERE THEY'LL GO IN. AND CHRIS JANSING IS THERE. CHRIS. >> DRAMATIC IMAGES OF THE  PEACEFUL TRANSITION OF POWER  WITH THE CURRENT PRESIDENT AND  THE PRESIDENT-ELECT NOW ARRIVING AT WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE CARRIAGE ENTRANCE. THIS IS A PRACTICE THAT DATES  BACK, LESTER, TO 1837 WITH THE  CURRENT AND SOON TO BE PRESIDENT RIDING TOGETHER IN THE SAME  VEHICLE. IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA, OF COURSE, RETAINS POWER  NOW UNTIL THE OATH OF OFFICE IS  GIVEN. THERE IS, IN FACT, A SKELETON  STAFF AT THE WHITE HOUSE RIGHT  NOW. BUT THIS IS THE MOMENT THAT WE  HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR. THEY WILL ARRIVE THROUGH THE  DOORS HERE, GREETED BY AN  INAUGURAL WHICH THE, MILITARY  CORDON, SENATE AND HOUSE  SERGEANTS AT ARMS WHO ARE HERE  WAITING FOR THEM. I SEE MICHELLE OBAMA CLOSEST TO  ME AND MELANIA TRUMP, SOON TO BE FIRST LADY, BEING DIRECTED  AROUND ONE OF THESE VEHICLES  HERE. THEY WILL GO UP THESE STAIRS AND THROUGH THE DOOR. THIS IS A VERY FINALLY TIMED  EVENT. THEY WILL GO INTO HOLDING ROOMS. ANYONE WHOS HAS EVER BEEN TO THE CAPITOL, WHO HAS TAKEN A TOUR OF THE CAPITOL, THERE IS A PLACE IN THE CENTER OF IT THAT HAS 13  STATUES REPRESENTING THE 13  COLONIES. IT IS CALLED THE CRYPT. THEY WILL GO IN THOSE HOLDING  ROOMS AND WAIT FOR THE SYMBOL,  THE SIGN TO GO OUT. BUT THEY'RE HAVING A  CONVERSATION RIGHT NOW. YOU CAN SEE THE FIRST LADIES  TOGETHER, GETTING SOME  DIRECTIONS FROM PEOPLE. ALSO SOME PLEASANTRIES. THEY'VE WORKED CLOSELY WITH  MEMBERS OF THIS INAUGURAL  COMMITTEE AND, OBVIOUSLY, THE  TRANSITION COMMITTEE. THEY WILL GO UP THE STAIRS,  THROUGH THE DOORS, DOWN THE HALL AND ONCE THAT HOLD IS OVER, OF  COURSE, THE LAST PERSON WHO WILL GO OUT WILL BE PRESIDENT-ELECT  DONALD J. TRUMP. HE WILL WALK DOWN A SET OF 35  STAIRS. I WALKED IT JUST THE OTHER DAY. THERE WILL BE, RIGHT BEFORE HE  GOES THROUGH THE RED CARTANS, A  MIRROR THAT IS HANGING ON THE  WALL, A MEMBER OF THE INAUGURAL  COMMITTEE SAID TO ME THAT'S THE  LAST CHECKPOINT WHERE HE CAN SEE HOW HE LOOKS. THERE'S PETE SOUZA. >> AND YOU WILL GO TO TAKE THE  OATH. >> AND HERE WE SEE THEM ENTERING INSIDE THE CAPITAL. PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP, PRESIDENT OBAMA. >> SPEAKER RYAN. LET'S LISTEN AND SEE IF WE CAN  PICK UP SOME OF THE --  >> HELLO. HELLO, EVERYBODY. >> CONGRATULATIONS, SIR. >> GOD BLESS OUR FELLOW  COLLEAGUES THERE GETTING THAT  SHOUTING QUESTION IN. >> OKAY. WE'RE MOVING. >> TO THE QUESTION, WE ARE BOG  TO BE LOOKING FOR SOME -- HERE  IN THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. >> DON'T EXPECT IT TODAY. I THINK IT'S -- I FIND IT  SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL THAT THEY HAVE  TALKED THAT MONDAY SHOULD BE  VIEWED AS THE FIRST REAL DAY OF  THE PRESIDENCY. >> THE PENCES. >> THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO  THIS, QUOTE, HIT GROUND RUNNING  ASPECT TODAY. IT'S REALLY MONDAY THAT THEY'RE  BUILDING TOWARDS. >> ONE OF THE KEY AIDES,  HOWEVER, TOLD ME THAT HE WOULD  NOT BE SURPRISED IF THEY WERE  CHALLENGED ON THE WEEKEND IN  SOME FORM, ECONOMICALLY OR  OTHERWISE. >> WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE ONE  CHALLENGE THAT EVERYBODY IS  CONCERNED B ABOUT AND THAT'S  NORTH KOREA. THEY ARE ANTICIPATING A TEST  LAUNCH OF SOME FORM SOON. >> HERE ARE THE TRUMP CHILDREN. THERE'S IVANKA AND TIFFANY AND  DONALD JR. AND ERIC TRUMP. SOMBER FACES AS THEY PREPARE TO  STEP OUT ASK WATCH THEIR FATHER  BECOME THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. >> AND BARRON THERE, TOO. >> CHUCK WAS TALK AGO MOMENT AGO ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A  CHALLENGE FROM NORTH KOREA. WE TALKED ABOUT THE SYMBOLIC OF  A SMOOTH TRANSITION, BUT ONE  THING THAT'S DEVELOPED IN RECENT YEARS IS THAT THE OLD PRESIDENT  AND THE NEW PRESIDENT AND THEIR  PEOPLE HAVE NATIONAL SECURITY  EXERCISES SO THAT IF, GOD  FORBID, SOMETHING LIKE THIS  HAPPENS ONE MINUTE AFTER THE  OATH TAKING, THE NEW PRESIDENT  AND HIS STAFF WILL BE A LITTLE  BIT MORE UP TO SPEED. >> AND THESE ARE POST 9/11  REFORMS. I WAS TALK, ANDY CARD WHO WAS  THE CHIEF OF STAFF FOR GEORGE W. BUSH. AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THEY  PUT IN SOME NEW -- IN ORDER TO  MAKE THIS TRANSITION SMOOTHER,  HE SAID THAT THE OBAMA  ADMINISTRATION ENHANCED IT EVEN  MORE. THEY DID AN EXERCISE LAST WEEK. IT WAS BASICALLY BOTH TEAMS. THEY DID A -- ESSENTIALLY A  PRACTICE EMERGENCY EXERCISE, AS  YOU CALL. AND THAT IS A SOBERING MOMENT  FOR ALL OF THE ADVISERS. THAT'S THE FIRST TIME THEY FEEL  THE WEIGHT OF WHAT THEY'RE ABOUT TO DO. >>S AS WE LOOK AT THE KIDS COME  IN HERE, IT'S WORTH NOTING  IVANKA TRUMP WAS ASKED ABOUT  WHETHER SHE WOULD SERVE AS THE  PSEUDO FIRST LADY AND SHE SHUT  THAT DOWN. >> AND EMPHATICALLY SO. >> AND IT WAS THE FIRST TIME SHE GOT THE TO ANSWER THAT. SHE WILL HAVE NO OFFICIAL ROLE  IN THIS WHITE HOUSE. AND THERE IS THE VIEW. HALLIE JACKSON HAS GOT A GREAT  VIEW LOOKING ON THAT TO THAT  WEST FRONT WHERE ALL THIS IS  TAKING PLACE. HALLIE, WHAT ARE YOU SEEING? >> HI, LESTER. WE ARE JUST ACROSS FROM THE VIEW THAT YOU ARE SHOWING NOW ON A  MEDIA RISER. JUST A LITTLE COLOR FROM THE  GROUND HERE. AS PEOPLE ARE WATCHING ON THE  MONITORS, EVERY TIME THEY SEE A  SHOT OF THE PRESIDENT-ELECT OR  HIS FAMILY, A BIG CHEER GOES UP. THERE HAVE BEEN ANNOUNCEMENTS  NOW AS EACH OF THE FORMER LIVING PRESIDENTS HAS WALKED IN. PRESIDENT CARTER AND PRESIDENT  BUSH AND PRESIDENT CLINTON, AS  WELL. THE SENATORS WHO HAVE GATHERED  HERE ON THE PLATFORM ARE DOING  WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE ARE  DOING WHICH IS PICKING UP THEIR  PHONES AND TAKING SELFIES. >> AND HERE, I BELIEVE, IS THE  FIRST TIME THE PUBLIC IS SEEING  THE TRUMP CHILDREN. I BELIEVE THEY'RE ABOUT TO WALK  OUT INTO PUBLIC VIEW. THERE THEY ARE. YOU CAN HEAR THAT APPLAUSE. LET'S LISTEN. >> THE CHIEF OF STAFF IS EVEN  DOING PHOTOS THERE. >> ONE OF THE FOLKS I  INTERVIEWED THIS WEEK IS TEXTING ME FROM THE CROWD. HE SAID THERE WERE POLITE CHEERS FOR HILLARY CLINTON WHEN SHE  WALKED OUT FROM THE TRUMP  SUPPORTERS GATHERED ON THE MALL. THAT'S A NICE SENTIMENT. >> WHICH LEADS ONE OF THE  QUESTIONS I WANTED TO ASK LATER  ON, BUT LET'S ASK IT NOW, WOULD  YOU EXPECT, AS PRESIDENT TRUMP,  TO NAME HER IN HIS SPEECH? >> HE SHOULD. I WOULD HOPE SO. HE HAS NOTHING TO LOSE AND  EVERYTHING TO GAIN BY TRYING TO  GROW HIS SUPPORT BY BEING  GRACIOUS. >> I'M SORRY --  >> NOTHING TO LOSE. >> I'M SHOCKED THAT THEY HAVEN'T HAD A PRIVATE MEETING, A LUNCH,  A COFFEE. >> AND THEY KNOW EACH OTHER. >> SHE WENT TO HIS WEDDING. THIS IS, I THINK, THE BIGGEST  MISTAKE HE MADE DURING THE  TRANSITION. SHE MAY NOT HAVE WANTED TO DO  IT, BUT THERE'S NO WAY SHE COULD HAVE TURNED DOWN THAT INVITATION FROM THE PRESIDENT-ELECT. THE FACT THAT THEY HAVEN'T DONE  IT YET I JUST THINK IS A  MISTAKE. >> KEEP IN MIND, HE NEVER FULLY  CLOSED THE DOOR ON PROSECUTING  HER. REMEMBER, HE HAD THROWN THAT  OUT --  >> CORRECT. >> -- BEFORE THE ELECTION. >> YOU KNOW, WELL, IT IS -- I'M  GLAD TO HEAR THAT ABOUT THE  CROWD. I DON'T -- YOU KNOW, I THINK WE  WERE DISCUSSING EARLIER, HOW  WOULD THE CROWD, WOULD IT BE --  FEEL LIKE A TRUMP CAMPAIGN  RALLY? WOULD WE START HEARING SOME  CHANTS THAT WE'VE GOTTEN USED TO DURING THE CAMPAIGN? MY FEELING IS NO. I THINK YOU -- I DON'T CARE WHO  YOU ARE AS AN AMERICAN CITIZEN,  YOU WALK INTO THIS CAPITOL THIS  WEEK AND DEMOCRACY IS JUST  RAINING ON YOU. AND YOU START THINKING AS AN  AMERICAN, NOT AS A --  >> AND NICOLE, I DON'T KNOW IF  YOU HEARD THIS, BUT WHEN I WAS  TOURING THE COUNTRY, ONE WOMAN  SAID IT SO ARTICULATELY. SHE IS AGAINST DONALD TRUMP. THIS WAS FOR CLINTON. BUT SHE SAID, YOU KNOW, I HEAR  ALL THIS NOT MY PRESIDENT. SHE GOES, HE IS MY PRESIDENT. AND, YOU KNOW, SHE SAYS, I'VE  GOT TO ROOT FOR MY PRESIDENT TO  SUCCEED. >> AND YOU KNOW WHERE YOU HEAR  THAT IS IN THE MILITARY. AND DONALD TRUMP DID REALLY WELL ON MILITARY FAMILIES AND AMONG  VETERANS. BUT HE DIDN'T WIN THEM ALL. BUT THEY HAVE TO LIVE THAT. THEY DON'T GET TO JUST SAY.IT. THE THEY HAVE TO LIVE WITH THIS  MAN AS THEIR COMMANDER IN CHIEF. I KNOW PEOPLE THAT SAY IT MEAN  IT AND THEY ARE REALLY STILL  HURTING. THEY FEEL DISPONDANT ABOUT THE  OUTCOME. BUT IT'S NOT A PARTICULARLY  PRODUCTIVE SENTIMENT. >> YEAH. AND THERE IS SOME OF THE CROWD. I KNOW THE PARK SERVICE AND  OTHERS, THEY DON'T LIKE TO GET  WITH THE CROWD COUNTING  BUSINESS. I THINK THERE WAS TALK OF  ANYWHERE FROM 700,000 TO 900,000 TO COME AND WITNESS THIS. THERE ARE PROTESTS IN VARIOUS  PARTS OF TOWN. THERE WERE THREATS TO --  >> WE'LL GET A CROWD ESTIMATE  FROM SOMEBODY. >> WE'LL PROBABLY GET ONE FROM  DONALD TRUMP. ARE YOU GUYS KIDDING ME? >> THAT'S WHO I WAS REFERRING  TO, NICOLE. WE'LL GET AN OFFICIAL ESTIMATE  PERHAPS FROM THE PODIUM. >> WE MAY GET SOME NEW POLL  NUMBERS, YOU GUYS, A REPORT ON  HOW WE'RE DOING AND THE COVERAGE OF THE EVENT. HE'S STILL DONALD TRUMP. >> YEAH. KATIE IS DOWN IN THE CROWD RIGHT NOW AS WE TAKE A LOOK AT JARED  TRUMP. KATIE, WHAT IS THE MOOD DOWN  THERE? HAVE PEOPLE BEEN STAKED OUT FOR  A WHILE? >> YEAH. THEY'VE BEEN HERE FOR QUITE A  WHILE, WITH THEY'RE COVERED IN  PONCHOS, THEY'RE WEARING HATS. I WAS WONDERING, AS WELL, WHAT  THE REACTION WOULD BE WHEN  HILLARY CLINTON AND BILL CLINTON WALKED DOWN. WHILE THERE WASN'T A LARGE CHEER IN THE SAME WAY THERE WAS FOR  GEORGE W. BUSH, THERE WAS NOT  ANYBODY WHO WAS ENGINEERING IN  ANY WAY AT HILLARY CLINTON. THEY SAID TO ME THAT THEY  BELIEVE THIS WAS PROBABLY A  PRETTY HARD MOMENT FOR HER. THEY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT. BUT THESE PEOPLE ARE TRUMP  VOTERS. THEY'RE THE ONES THAT PUT HIM  INTO THE OFFICE. THEY'RE THE ONES THAT THEY FEEL  DEFIED THE ODDS. AND THEY FEEL VERY VINDICATED  RIGHT NOW. NOW THEY'RE GOING TO START  CHANTING USA, WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY WHAT WE HEARD QUITE A BIT OF ON  THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. >> WHAT CAN YOU SEE WITH THE  NAKED EYE FROM WHERE YOU ARE,  PEOPLE SEEING THIS ON A SWRUM    JUMBOTRON. >> WE ACTUALLY HAVE A REALLY  GOOD VIEW. . WE HAVE A DIRECT VIEW OF DONALD  TRUMP, EASY ON TO SEE. BUT THERE'S A BIG SCREEN OVER  HERE SO THEY CAN SEE PEOPLE THAT ARE WALKING DOWN THE STAIRS. THEY CAN SEE FACES, FACES OF  DONALD TRUMP'S CABINET. THEY WERE THERE WERE A NUMBER OF CHEERS AS DONALD TRUMP'S CABINET TOOK THE STAGE. BUT THEY HAVE A GREAT VIEW OF  DONALD TRUMP AND HOW HE WILL BE  TAKING THE OATH OF OFFICE. IN TERMS OF THE CROWD, IT LOOKS  PRETTY FILLED TO BE HERE. THESE FOLKS HAVE BEEN WAITING  FOR HOURS. THEY ARE EXCITED. THIS IS A DAY THEY HOPED THEY  WOULD SEE COME AND IT'S A DAY  THEY FEEL THEY DESERVED. BACK TO YOU. THAT'S AN INCREDIBLE PICTURE OF  THE MALL. >> I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL OUR FOLKS  DO THE SPEED UP, YOU KNOW WITH  THE CROWD FILLING IN. WE'VE BEEN WATCHING ALL MORNING. AS 7:00 A.M., AS YOU MIGHT  EXPECT, STARINGELERS. EVERY HALF HOUR, IT'S BEEN NEAT  TO SEE IT FILL IN. >> AND JACOB IS NEAR THE FAR END OF THE MALL. WHAT ARE YOU SEEING? >> YES. YOU CAN SEE THE SUPPORTERS ALL  THE WAY DOWN TO THE BACK. WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS FIRST  ININAUGURAL RATED IN 2009, 1.8  MILLION PEOPLE WERE HERE. AND I CAN SHOW YOU THIS WAY TO  THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT. IT'S NOT QUITE AS FILLED UP  RIGHT NOW. BUT EVERYONE HAS BEEN WATCHING  FROM EACH AND EVERY MOMENT FROM  I GUESS WHAT YOU WOULD CALL THE  NOSE BLEEDS UP ON THESE  TELEVISION MONITORS UP HERE. WE CAN SEE WHAT YOU CAN SEE FROM ABOUT 1.1 MILES AWAY. SECURITY IS VERY TIGHT. PART OF THE REASON WHY I TOOK SO LONG FOR PEOPLE TO FILL IN HERE, BUT THE CROWDS ARE COMING AND  THEY'RE CERTAINLY ENTHUSIASTIC. >> JACOB, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. JUST TO RECAP, IF YOU'RE JUST  TUNING IN, PRESIDENT OBAMA AND  FIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA AND  THE TRUMPS HAVE NOW ARRIVED AT  THE CAPITOL. THEY ARE IN A HOLDING ROOM. VIRTUALLY ALL THE VIPs HAVE  TAKEN THEIR PLACE ON THE  PLATFORM ON THE WEST FRONT AND  WE WILL BE GETTING UNDER WAY  QUITE SHORTLY. I THINK 11:30 IS WHEN THE  CEREMONY BEGINS AND THERE IS  SOME OF THE NOTABLES, SECRETARY  CLINTON AND PRESIDENT CLINTON. SO MANY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. IT HAS BEEN NOTED THAT THE  MEMBERS OF CONGRESS HAVE CHOSEN  TO BOYCOTT THIS GATHERING TODAY. I THINK THE LAST NUMBER I HEARD  WAS AROUND 60 OR SO. >> MAINLY IN REACTION TO THE  FLAP THAT JOHN LEWIS HAD AND HIS COMMENTS HE MADE TO YOU  ORIGINALLY ABOUT THE LEGITIMACY  OF THE --  >> AND AND AN UNTOLD NUMBER OF  PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY,  BEFORE WE GET TO KUMBAYA ARE NOT WATCHING. >> AND THERE WILL BE A LARGE  PROTEST IN THIS TOWN TOMORROW,  AND NOT AN INSIGNIFICANT ONE ON  THAT SAME MALL. >> THE WOMEN'S MARCH ALL OVER  THE COUNTRY. >> SO LET'S NOT FORGET THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO LOOK AT 3 MILLION  MARGIN, BUT THE WHOLE RUSSIAN  HACKING EPISODE AND THEY HAVE  NOT GIVEN UP. >> AND HERE IS FIRST LADY  MICHELLE OBAMA BEING ESCORTED  NOW ALONG WITH DR. JILL BIDEN. >> I BELIEVE --  THEY'VE BEEN VERY CLOSE. THEY'VE BEEN WORKING ON VETERANS ISSUES, THE TWO OF THEM. THEY HAVE A HIGH REGARD FOR ONE  ANOTHER AND THEY'VE GONE TO  DIFFERENT BASES AND HAD  SEMINARES AND OTHER --  >> AND DR. BIDEN HAS CONTINUED  TO TEACH. I WAS AT AN EVENT WITH HER OVER  THE LAST YEAR AND I SAID WHAT  ARE YOU LOOKING MOST FORWARD TO  WHEN IT'S OVER? SHE GOES, JOGGING ALONE. I REMEMBER SHE SAYS, YOU KNOW,  IT'S WEIRD JOGGING ALONG AND SHE SAID YOU END UP GETTING  COMPETITIVE WITH THE SECRET  SERVICE AGENTS, AS WELL. >> AND THEY'RE REALLY FIT. >> SHE SAID I JUST WANT TO BE  ABLE TO RUN ALONE. >> AND VICE PRESIDENTS LOSE  THEIR SECRET SERVICE DETAIL  FAIRLEY QUICKLY. FORMER PRESIDENTS NEVER LOSE  ITS. SO MICHELLE OBAMA AND BARACK,  THEY'LL NEVER FULLY BE ALONE  AGAIN. AND THAT IS A HARD THING FOR  FORMER PRESIDENTS. >> WE SHOULD CHECK THIS. I THOUGHT AT SOME POINT THEY  WERE GOING TO LIMIT HOW LONG,  HOW MANY YEARS. >> THERE'S STILL A FULL  COMPLIMENT OF SECRET SERVICE. >> I HAD A CLASSMATE WHO WAS A  SECRET SERVICE AGENT FOR  PRESIDENT FORD. THAT WAS VERY GOOD DUTY. YOU WERE AT VALE IN THE  WINTERTIME FOR SKIING, PALM  SPRINGS FOR SUMMERTIME. >> I REMEMBER BUMPING INTO LAID  LADY BIRD JOHNSON AND THERE SHE  WAS WITH TWO AGENTS. >> THIS WILL BE A LARGE FIRST  FAMILY. RICK PERRY, GOVERNOR PERRY, THIS WILL BE A LARGE FIRST FAMILY TO  PROTECT. BECAUSE THEY LIVE IN SEPARATE  PLACES AND ALL BUT ONE ARE  ADULTS. >> AND IT IS A -- IT'S GOING TO  BE ACTUALLY, WE TALK ABOUT  SECURITY. THERE'S A BIG QUESTION ABOUT THE TRUMP BRANDED BUILDINGS. WHAT EXTRA SECURITY, HOW MUCH IS THE GOVERNMENT -- THIS IS  ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT STILL  HASN'T QUITE BEEN WORKED OUT YET IN NATIONAL SECURITY CIRCLES. >> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE  FIRST LADY, MRS. MICHELLE OBAMA  AND THE WIFE OF THE VICE  PRESIDENT, DR. JILL BIDEN,  ESCORTED BY THE DIRECT HER OF  THE UNITED STATES SENATE  COMMITTEE ON RULES AND  ADMINISTRATION KELLY FADO, MISS  IRAWANSHAW AND MR. PAUL PELOSI. >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU. >> AS THEY TAKE THEIR SEATS,  MICHAEL BENCHLOS HAS BEEN  LOOKING AT THE SECURITY AROUND  THE TRUMP HOTEL. STRONG WITH BARRICADES AND  HUNDREDS OF POLICE OFFICERS AND  MARINES. >> THIS IS A REMARKABLE PICTURE, >> WE TALKED ABOUT THE CLINTON  AND BUSH RELATIONSHIP, MRS.  OBAMA AND GEORGE W. BUSH WERE  LAST TOGETHER AT THE MEMORIAL  SERVICE IN DALLAS AND THEY WERE  HOLDING HANDS AND SWAYING TO  SOME OF THE HYMNS AT THE END. SO THE BUSHES HAVE GOTTEN TO  KNOW THE CLINTONS AND THE OBAMAS QUITE WELL. I HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT  MRS. OBAMA .HER CONTRIBUTIONS TO FASHION BECAUSE I'M STANDING  NEXT TO FOUR MEN IN BLUE SUITS. >> OH! >> NONFASHIONABLE. >> NO, YOU LOOK GREAT BECAUSE  YOU'RE ALL WEARING THE SAME  SUIT. >> OUCH. >> OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD, NICOLE. >> SHE'S BEEN KNOWN THE WORLD  OVER AND WATCHED THE WORLD OVER  FOR PICKING OUT DESIGNERS YOUNG  AND UPCOMING DESIGNERS. MELANIA TRUMP IS A BEAUTIFUL  WOMAN AND OBVIOUSLY A FASHION  ICON WITH, A FORMER MODEL. BUT IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO  SEE IF THAT IS HER PRACTICE. WOMEN CARE ABOUT STUFF LIKE  THIS, YOU GUYS. Y'ALL ARE LOOKING AT ME  DUMBFOUNDED. >> NICOLE, I'M NOT --  >> I'M GETTING A THUMBS UP FROM  THE WOMEN IN THE STUDIO. >> SHE WEARS J. CREW, SHE WEARS  HIGH END. THAT'S WHY PEOPLE LOVE HER. >> I'M SURE PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY  TWEETED OUT WHERE TO BUY WHAT  SHE'S WEARING RIGHT NOW. >> AND MELANIA WEARING RALPH  LAUREN. >> THE FIRST FAMILY WILL BE ABLE TO SHED THEIR COATS. THEY'RE HEADING TO CALIFORNIA  FOR A LITTLE WARMTH AFTER THIS. >> AND THAT ECHOS JARED FORD WHO IN 1977 DID EXACTLY THE SAME  THING, GOT ON THE --  >> AND WENT TO PALM SPRINGS,  RIGHT? >> WENT TO PALM SPRINGS AND  ATTENDSED A GOLF TOURNAMENT THAT AFTERNOON. >> THAT IS A HOBBY THAT, YOU  KNOW, BARACK OBAMA WASN'T IN THE GULF BEFORE HE BECAME PRESIDENT. HE REALIZED GOLFING WAS ONE OF  THE FEW CHANCES YOU GOT TO WALK  ALONE A LITTLE BIT. PERHAPS IT WAS A PLACE THAT  MAYBE YOU COULD SNEAK A  CIGARETTE OR TWO. NOT SAYING THAT IS WHAT WOULD  HAPPEN -- HINT, HINT, BEFORE YOU QUIT. >> AND BE OUTSIDE. >> AND HE NOW LOVES THE SPORT. >> WE HAVEN'T SEEN A LOT OF  MELANIA TRUMP. SHE DID NOT MAKE ANY CAMPAIGN  APPEARANCES. SHE FAMOUSLY SPOKE AT THE  REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION. BUT HAS KEPT A RATHER LOW  PROFILE DURING THIS ENTIRE  CAMPAIGN AND THE TRANSITION. STEP OUT ON THE WORLD'S BIGGEST  STAGE. >> SHE HAS A 10-YEAR-OLD SON AND I THINK SHE HAS WORKED REALLY  HARD DURING THAT CAMPAIGN TO  BE -- TO MAKE SURE, YOU KNOW,  SHE WAS MOTHER TO HER SON DURING THIS PERIOD WHERE, YOU KNOW, HIS FATHER WAS HAVING TO TRAVEL THE  COUNTRY. >> SHE'S ALSO VERY SHY AND HER  FORRET AT THE CONVENTION WAS A  PLAGIARIZED SPEECH AND IT WAS  HUMILIATING FOR HER. IT'S NOT HER FAULT. IT'S THE STAFF'S FAULT FOR NOT  TAKING CHARGE OF THAT. I'M SURE SHE'S HOPING TAKE TWO  IS MORE SUCCESSFUL. . >> AND THERE'S THEIR SON,  BARRON. >> AND HE WILL FINISH SCHOOL  THIS YEAR IN NEW YORK. >> THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE OF  REPRESENTATIVES, KAREN HOSS,  MRS. ABIGAIL BLUNT, MRS. JENNA  RYAN AND MRS. JUDY McCARTHY. >> LOOKING AT THE JUXTAPOSITION  OF FORMER VICE PRESIDENT DICK  CHENEY AND JUST IN FRONT OF  THEM, JUST TO HIS RIGHT IS MRS.  OBAMA, OF COURSE. DICK CHENEY WAS PARTICULARLY  TOUGH ON THIS PRESIDENT AND ON  THIS ADD MEN ADMINISTRATION  SAYING, NO PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY HAS DONE MORE TO AID OUR ADVERSARIES, WHICH FOR SOMEONE  WHO IS SO INVOLVED IN THE LAUNCH OF THE WAR AGAINST IRAQ, A LOT  OF PEOPLE WERE STUNNED BY THAT  JUDGMENT AND CONCLUSION OF HIM. SO IT'S -- WE HAVEN'T SEEN  DONALD RUMSFELD, BY THE WAY. >> AND HERE IS THE PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT. >> SPEAKER AND THE DEMOCRATIC  LEADER OF THE SENATE. >> AND FOR MOST OF AMERICAN  HISTORY, YOU COULD NEVER SEE  THIS THING BEHIND THE SCENES  BECAUSE THERE WAS NO TELEVISION  AND ALSO FOR THE LAST DECADES,  TELEVISION WAS OFTENTIMES NOT OF THIS --  >> BY THE WAY, NANCY PELOSI  THERE IS WEARING A PIN, A  BUTTON, AND MANY DEMOCRATS TODAY ARE WEARING THAT SAME BUTTON. I'M TOLD IT SAYS  #PROTECTOURCARE. IT IS THEIR WAY OF JUST A QUIET  ADVOCATATION OF KEEPING  OBAMACARE. >> LET'S LISTEN FOR A MOMENT AS  THEY'RE ABOUT TO BE INTRODUCED. >> DONALD TRUMP ALWAYS WEARS A  RED TIE. ARE YOU NOTICING THAT ALL THE  DEMOCRATS HAVE BLUE TIES ON TT.  TODAY. >> AND ON THE TAKE THAT SHE  CONCEDED, HILLARY CLINTON WORE  PURPLE AND HER HUSBAND WORE A  PURPLE TIE. >> LET'S LISTEN. ♪♪ >> AND IN A MOMENT, THE  INTRODUCTION OF PRESIDENT OBAMA  AND PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP. ♪♪ >> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,  THE HONORABLE BARACK H.

HE WILL BE SPEAKING AS AN EX  PRESIDENT OVER AT ANDREWS. >> THAT'S CORRECT. >> SOMETIME LATER THIS  AFTERNOON. >> IN AN EXCHANGE BETWEEN  PRESIDENT OBAMA AND PRESIDENT  OBAMA. >> THEY LOOK LIKE THEY'RE  RIBBING EACH OTHER. >> CAN YOU WALK BY PRESIDENT  OBAMA BUSH AND NOT GET RIBBED? >> NO. >> I'M THINKING THE LAST TIME WE SAW THEM TOGETHER WAS AT THE  MEMORIAL FOR THE POLICE OFFICERS IN DALLAS. >> PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS TALKED  ABOUT THE PRESIDENT-ELECT AND  SAYS THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE  BETWEEN CAMPAIGNING AND  GOVERNING. AND IN JUST A FEW MOMENTS, THE  WEIGHT OF THE WORLD WILL BE ON  DONALD TRUMP. AND HE WILL KNOW WHAT GOVERNING  IS ABOUT. >> IT TAKES PRESIDENTS A LONG  TIME TO GET OUT OF CAMPAIGN  MODE, LONGER THAN YOU THINK. >> LISTEN TO THE CROWD. >> I DON'T THINK THE -- THEY  WERE SILENCED, BUT I THINK THE  MIKE WAS SILENCED THAT WAS  PICKING THEM HAD UP. >> HERE WE GO. >> THERE'S SOME BLUE TIES THERE  ON SOME REPUBLICANS, TOM.

LET'S LISTEN. >> MICHAEL, IN THE LONG HER OF  AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS  HAS ANYONE EVER DEFIED GREATER  MAN WITH WHO IS ABOUT TO BECOME  >> I CAN'T IMAGINE ONE  PARTICULARLY BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,  THERE WAS A LAW THAT WE WOULD  HAVE ALWAYS SAID PROBABLY WAS AN IRON LAW IN POLITICS UNTIL THE  LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS, WHICH WAS YOU DON'T GET ELECTED PRESIDENT  IF YOU DON'T HAVE SERIOUS  MILITARY EXPERIENCE OR SERIOUS  EXPERIENCE IN PUBLIC OFFICE. >> DONALD TRUMP ACTUALLY  SPEAKING TO THE CAMERA THERE FOR A MOMENT. DIDN'T QUITE HEAR WHAT HE SAID,  BUT LOOKED INTO THE LENS. THIS IS A MAN NOT EASILY HUMBLED AND YOU HAVE TO WONDER IS THIS  TRULY A HUMBLING MOMENT FOR HIM  AS HE IS ABOUT TO TAKE THE OATH. >> CERTAINLY LOOKS LIKE HE'S  FEELING WEIGHT. HE LOOKS LIKE THE DONALD TRUMP  WE SAW THAT SAT NEXT TO BARACK  OBAMA THAT FIRST TIME. >> THE VICE PRESIDENT ELECT  MICHAEL RICHARD PENCE.  >> NEVER LOOKED BETTER. NEVER LOOKED BETTER. >> VICE PRESIDENT ELECT GREETING FOLKS AS HE'S ABOUT TO TAKE HIS  PLACE. JUST A POINT OF FACT, I  MENTIONED THAT BARACK OBAMA AND  PRESIDENT BUSH, THE LAST TIME  THEY SAW EACH OTHER WAS IN  DALLAS. I STAND CORRECTED.

AND AT 12:0 1, ONE OF THE AIDES  CALLED THE SITUATION ROOM TO ASK FOR A REPORT AND THEY SAID, I'M  SORRY, YOU'RE NO LONGER CLEARED  FOR INFORMATION. >> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE  PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED  STATES, DONALD JOHN TRUMP. ♪♪ >> CAN WE OFFICIALLY SAY THAT'S  A TRADEMARK THING WITH HIM, THE  THUMBS UP. THAT'S HIS VERSION OF A WAVE. A SIGNATURE. ♪♪ ♪♪  ♪♪  ♪♪ >> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE  CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT  CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE FOR  INAUGURAL CEREMONIES, THE  HONORABLE ROY BLUNT. >> THANK YOU, ALL. IF YOU HAVE A SEAT, YOU CAN SIT  DOWN. MR. PRESIDENT, MR. VICE  PRESIDENT, MR. PRESIDENT-ELECT,  MR. VICE PRESIDENT ELECT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO THE  INAUGURATION OF THE 45th  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  OF AMERICA. TODAY, THE LEGISLATIVE, THE  EXECUTIVE, THE INJURY ADDITIONAL BRANCHES OF OUR CONSTITUTIONAL  GOVERNMENT COME TOGETHER FOR THE 58th INAUGURATION OF THE  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ALL OVER THE  WORLD WILL WATCH AND WILL LISTEN TO THIS EVENT. 36 YEARS AGO, AT HIS FIRST  INAUGURATION, IT WAS ALSO THE  FIRST INAUGURATIONING ON THIS  SIDE OF THE CAPITOL. PRESIDENT RONALD RIG REAGAN SAID BOTH WHAT WE DO HERE IS BOTH  COMMONPLACE AND MIRACULOUS. COMMONPLACE EVERY FOUR YEARS  SINCE 1789 WHEN PRESIDENT GEORGE WASHINGTON TOOK THIS EXECUTIVE  SAME OATH. MIRACULOUS BECAUSE WE'VE DONE IT EVERY FOUR YEARS SINCE 1789 AND  THE EXAMPLE IT SETS FOR  DEMOCRACIES EVERYWHERE. WASHINGTON BELIEVED THE  INAUGURATION OF THE SECOND  PRESIDENT WOULD BE MORE  IMPORTANT THAN THE INAUGURATION  OF THE FIRST. MANY PEOPLE HAD TAKEN CONTROL OF THE GOVERNMENT UP UNTIL THEN,  BUT FEW PEOPLE HAD EVER TURNED  THAT CONTROL WILLINGLY OVER TO  ANYONE ELSE. AND AS IMPORTANT AS THE TRANSFER OF THE -- THE FIRST TRANSFER OF  POWER WAS, MANY HISTORIANS  BELIEVE THAT THE NEXT ELECTION  WAS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT. WHEN IN 1801, ONE GROUP OF  PEOPLE ARGUABLY FOR THE FIRST  TIME EVER IN HISTORY WILLINGLY,  IF NOT ENTHUSIASTICALLY, GAVE  CONTROL OF THE GOVERNMENT TO  PEOPLE THEY BELIEVED HAD A  DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT VIEW OF  WHAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD,  SHOULD AND COULD DO. AFTER THAT ELECTION THAT  ACTUALLY DISCOVERED A FLAW IN  THE CONSTITUTION ITSELF, WHICH  WAS REMEDIED BY THE 12th  AMENDMENT, THOMAS JEFFERSON, AT  THAT INAUGURATION, BEYOND THE  CHAOS OF THE ELECTION THAT HAD  JUST PASSED SAID, WE ARE ALL  REPUBLICANS, WE ARE ALL  FEDERALISTS. AFTER FOUR YEARS OF CIVIL WAR,  LINCOLN'S SECOND INAUGURAL  SPEECH TRIED TO FIND REASON FOR  THE CONTINUED WAR WHEN HE  POINTED OUT THAT BOTH SIDES  PRAYED TO THE SAME GOD. HE HAD EARLIER WRITTEN ABOUT  THOSE FERVENT PRAYERS THAT ONE  OF THE SIDE MUST BE AND BOTH  SIDES MAY BE WRONG, BUT IN 1865, HE LOOKED TO THE FUTURE AND THE  MEMORABLE MOMENT IN THAT SPEECH  WAS WITH MALICE TOWARD NONE AND  CHARITY FOR ALL. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DEPRESSION, THE COUNTRY WAS TOLD THAT THE  ONLY THING WE HAD TO FEAR WAS  FEAR ITSELF. AND PRESIDENT KENNEDY TALKED  ABOUT THE OBLIGATION IN  DEMOCRACY TO COUNTRY. THE GREAT QUESTION THAT DAY WAS  ASK WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR YOUR  COUNTRY. SO WE COME TO THIS PLACE AGAIN,  COMMONPLACE AND MIRACULOUS, A  NATIONAL MOMENT OF CELEBRATION,  BUT NOT A CELEBRATION OF  VICTORY, A CELEBRATION OF  DEMOCRACY. AND AS WE BEGIN THAT  CELEBRATION, I CALL ON HIS  EMINENCE TIMOTHY MICHAEL  CARDINAL DOLAN, REVEREND HIKAL  SAMUEL RODRIGUEZ AND PASTOR  PAULA WHITECAN HAD E TO PROVIDE  READINGS AND THE INVOCATION. >> THE PRAYER OF KING SOLOMON  FROM THE BOOK OF WISDOM. LET US PRAY. GOD OF OUR ANCESTORS AND LORD OF MERCY, YOU HAVE MADE ALL THINGS  AND IN YOUR PROVIDENCE HAVE  CHARGED US TO RULE THE CREATURES PRODUCED BY YOU TO GOVERN THE  WORLD IN HOLINESS AND  RIGHTEOUSNESS AND TO RENDER  JUDGMENT WITH INTEGRITY OF  HEART. GIVE US WISDOM. FOR WE ARE YOUR SERVANTS WEAK  AND SHORT LIVED LACKING IN  COMPREHENSION OF JUDGMENT AND OF LAWS, INDEED, THOUGH ONE MIGHT  BE PERFECT AMONG MORTALS, IF  WISDOM WHICH COMES FROM YOU BE  LACKING, WE COUNT FOR NOTHING. NOW WITH YOU IS WISDOM, WHO  KNOWS YOUR WILL AND WAS THERE  WHEN YOU MADE THE WORLD, WHO  PLEASING IN YOUR EYES, WHAT IS  CONFORMABLE WITH YOUR COMMANDS. SEND HER FORTH PROSECUTE YOUR  HOLY HEAVENS, FROM YOUR GLORIOUS THRONE DISPATCH HER, THAT SHE  MAY BE WITH US AND WORK WITH US  THAT WE MAY GRASP WHAT IS  PLEASING TO YOU, FOR SHE KNOWS  AND UNDERSTANDS ALL THINGS AND  WILL GUIDE US MRUNTLY IN OUR  AFFAIRS AND SAFE FWAURD US BY    HER GLORY. AMEN. >> FROM THE GOSPEL OF MATTHER  THE FIFTH CHAPTER. GOD BLESSES THOSE WHO ARE POOR  AND REALIZE THEIR NEED OVAL HIM  FOR THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS  THEIRS. GOD BLESSES THOSE WHO MOURN FOR  THEY WILL BE COMFORTED. GOD BLESSES THOSE WHO ARE HUMBLE FOR THEY WERE INHERIT THE EARTH. GOD BLESSES THOSE WHO HUNGER AND THIRST FOR JUSTICE FOR THEY WILL BE SATISFIED. GOD BLESSES THOSE WHO ARE  MERCIFUL FOR THEY WILL BE SHOWN  MERCY. HE BLESSES THOSE WHO ARE PURE IN HEART. FOR THEY WILL SEE GOD. GOD BLESSES THOSE WHO WORK FOR  PEACE YOU FOR THEY ARE CHIRP OF  GOD. GOD BLESSES THOSE WHO ARE  PERSECUTED FOR DOING RIGHT AND  GOD BLESSES YOU WHEN PEOPLE MOCK YOU AND PERCENT CUTE YOU AND LIE ABOUT YOU AND SAY ALL SORTS OF  EVIL THINGS AGAINST YOU FOR YOU  ARE MY FOLLOWERS. LIKE A CITY ON A HILLTOP THAT  CANNOT BE HIDDEN, NO ONE LIGHTS  A LAMP AND PUTS IT UNDER A  BASKET. INSTEAD, A LAMP IS PLACED ON ITS STAND WHERE IT GIVES LIGHT TO  EVERYONE IN THE HOUSE. IN THE SAME WAY, LET YOUR GOOD  DEEDS SHINE OUT FOR ALL TO SEE  THAT EVERYONE WILL PRAISE YOUR  HEAVENLY TAER. RESPECTFULLY IN JESUS NAME. >> WE COME TO YOU, HEAVENLY  TAER, IN THE NAME OF JESUS WITH  GRATEFUL HEARTS THANKING YOU FOR THIS GREAT COUNTRY THAT YOU HAVE DECREED TO YOUR PEOPLE. WE ACKNOWLEDGE WE ARE A PLEASED  NATION WITH A RICH HISTORY OF  FAITH AND FORTITUDE, WITH A  FUTURE THAT IS FILLED WITH  PROMISE AND PURPOSE. WE RECOGNIZE THAT EVERY GOOD AND EVERY PERFECT GIFT COMES FROM  YOU AND THE UNITED STATES OF  AMERICA IS YOUR GIFT FOR WHICH  WE PROCLAIM OUR GRATITUDE. AS A NATION, WE NOW PRAY FOR OUR PRESIDENT, DONALD JOHN TRUMP,  VICE PRESIDENT MICHAEL RICHARD  PENCE, AND THEIR FAMILIES. WE ASK THAT YOU WOULD BESTOW  UPON OUR PRESIDENT THE WISDOM  NECESSARY TO LEAD THIS GREAT  NATION, THE GRACE TO UNIFY US  AND THE STRENGTH TO STAND FOR  WHAT IS HONORABLE AND RIGHT THE  HAD IN YOUR SIGHT. IN PROVERBS 21:1, YOU INSTRUCT  US THAT OUR LEADER'S HEART IS IN YOUR HANDS. GRACIOUS GOD, REVEAL UNTO OUR  PRESIDENT THE ABILITY TO KNOW  THE WILL, YOUR WILL, THE  CONFIDENCE TO LEAD US IN JUSTICE AND RIGHTEOUSNESS AND THE  COMPASSION TO YIELD TO OUR  BETTER ANGELS. WHILE WE KNOW THERE ARE MANY  CHALLENGES BEFORE US, IN EVERY  GENERATION YOU HAVE PROVIDED THE STRENGTH AND POWER TO BECOME  THAT BLESSED NATION. GUIDE US IN DISCERNMENT, LORD,  AND GIVE US THAT STRENGTH TO  PERSEVERE AND THRIVE. NOW BIND AND HEAL OUR WOUNDS AND DIVISIONS. AND JOIN US NATION TO YOUR  PURPOSE. THY KINGDOM COME THY WILL BE  DONE. THE PSALM IS DECLARED. LET YOUR FAVOR BE UPON THIS ONE  NATION UNDER GOD. LET THESE UNITED STATES OF  AMERICA BE THAT BEACON OF HOPE  TO ALL PEOPLE AND NATIONS UNDER  YOUR DOMINION, A TRUE HOPE FOR  HUMAN KIND. GLORY TO THE FATHER, THE SON AND THE HOLY SPIRIT, WE PRAY THIS IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST.

WE FACE THREATS, FOREIGN AND  DOMESTIC. IN SUCH TIMES, FAITH IN OUR  GOVERNMENT, OUR INSTITUTIONS AND EVEN OUR COUNTRY CAN ERODE. DESPITE THESE CHALLENGES, I  STAND HERE TODAY CONFIDENT IN  THIS GREAT COUNTRY FOR ONE  REASON. YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE AMERICANS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A  FORWARD LOOKING,  PROBLEM-SOLVING, OPTIMISTIC,  PATRIOTIC AND DECENT PEOPLE. WHATEVER OUR RACE, RELIGION,  SEXUAL ORIENTATION, GENDER  IDENTITY, WHETHER WE ARE  IMMIGRANT OR NATIVE BORN,  WHETHER WE LIVE WITH  DISABILITIES OR DO NOT, IN  WEALTH OR IN POVERTY, WE ARE ALL EXCEPTIONAL IN OUR COMMONLY HELD YET FIERCE DEVOTION TO OUR  COUNTRY. AND IN OUR WILLINGNESS TO  SACRIFICE OUR TIME, ENERGY, AND  EVEN OUR LIVES TO MAKING IT A  MORE PERFECT UNION. TODAY, WE CELEBRATE ONE OF  DEMOCRACY'S CORE ATTRIBUTES, THE PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER. AND EVERY DAY WE STAND UP FOR  CORE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPALS  ENSHRINED IN THE CONSTITUTION,  THE RULE OF LAW, EQUAL  PRODUCTION FOR ALL UNDER LAW,  THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH, PRESS,  RELIGION, THE THINGS THAT MAKE  AMERICA AMERICA. AND WE CAN GAIN STRENGTH FROM  READING OUR HISTORY AND  LISTENING TO THE VOICES OF  AVERAGE AMERICANS. THEY HAD ALWAYS SAVE US IN TIMES OF STRIFE. ONE SUCH AMERICAN WAS MAJOR  SULLIVAN BLUE. ON JULY 14th, 1861, WHEN THE  NORTHERN AND SOUTH WERE LINING  UP FOR THEIR FIRST BATTLE, A  TIME WHEN OUR COUNTRY WAS  BITTERLY DIVIDED AND FAITH IN  THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY WAS AT A NADER, MAJOR BALU OF THE  SECOND RHODE ISLAND VOLUNTEERS  PENNED A LETTER TO HIS WIFE,  SARA. IT IS ONE OF THE GREATEST  LETTERS IN AMERICAN HISTORY. IT SHOWS THE STRENGTH AND  COURAGE OF THE AVERAGE AMERICAN. ALLOW ME TO READ SOME OF HIS  WORDS WHICH ECHO THROUGH THE  AGES. MY VERY DEAR SARA, HE WROTE, THE INDICATIONS ARE VERY STRONG THAT WE SHALL MOVE IN A FEW DAYS,  PERHAPS TOMORROW. IF IT IS NECESSARY THAT I SHOULD FALL ON THE BATTLEFIELD FOR MY  COUNTRY, I AM READY. I HAVE NO MISGIVINGS ABOUT OR  LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE CAUSE  IN WHICH I AM ENGAGED. AND MY COURAGE DOES NOT HALT OR  FALTER. I KNOW HOW STRONGLY AMERICAN  CIVILIZATION NOW LEANS UPON THE  TRIUMPH OF THE GOVERNMENT AND  HOW GREAT A DEBT WE OWE TO THOSE WHO WENT BEFORE US THROUGH THE  BLOOD AND SUFFERING OF THE  REVOLUTION. AND I AM WILLING, PERFECTLY  WILLING, TO LAY DOWN ALL MY JOYS IN THIS LIFE TO ON HELP MAINTAIN THIS GOVERNMENT AND TO PAY THAT  DEBT. SARA, MY LOVE FOR YOU IS  DEATHLESS. IT SEEMS TO BIND ME TO YOU WITH  THE MIGHTY CABLES THAT NOTHING  BUT OMNIPOTENCE CAN BREAK. AND YET MY LOVE OF COUNTRY COMES OVER ME LIKE A STRONG WIND AND  BEARS ME IRRESISTIBLY ON WITH  ALL THESE CHAINS TO THE  BATTLEFIELD. SULLIVAN BLUE GAVE HIS LIFE ON  THE BATTLEFIELD A WEEK LATER AT  THE FIRST BATTLE OF BULL RUN. IT IS BECAUSE SULLIVAN BLUE AND  COUNTLESS OTHERS BELIEVED IN  SOMETHING BIGGER THAN THEMSELVES AND WERE WILLING TO SACRIFICE  FOR IT THAT WE STAND TODAY IN  THE FULL BLESSINGS OF LIBERTY,  IN THE GREATEST COUNTRY ON  EARTH. AND THAT SPIRIT LIVES ON IN EACH OF US, AMERICANS WHOSE FAMILIES  HAVE BEEN HERE FOR GENERATIONS  AND THOSE WHO HAVE JUST ARRIVED. AND I KNOW OUR BEST DAY HES ARE  YET TO COME. I URGE ALL AMERICANS TO READ  BLUE'S FULL LETTER, HIS WORDS  GIVE ME SOLACE, STRENGTH. I HOPE THEY WILL GIVE YOU THE  SAME.

WE, THE CITIZENS OF AMERICA, ARE NOW JOINED IN A GREAT NATIONAL  EFFORT TO REBUILD OUR COUNTRY  AND RESTORE ITS PROMISE FOR ALL  OF OUR PEOPLE. TOGETHER, WE WILL DETERMINE THE  COURSE OF AMERICA AND THE WORLD  FOR MANY, MANY YEARS TO COME. WE WILL FACE CHALLENGES. WE WILL CONFRONT HARDSHIPS, BUT  WE WILL GET THE JOB DONE. EVERY FOUR YEARS, WE GATHER ON  THESE STEPS TO CARRY OUT THE  ORDERLY AND PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER AND WE ARE GRATEFUL TO  PRESIDENT OBAMA AND FIRST LADY  MICHELLE OBAMA FOR THEIR  GRACIOUS AID THROUGHOUT THIS  TRANSITION. THEY HAVE BEEN MAGNIFICENT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. TODAY'S CEREMONY, HOWEVER, HAS  VERY SPECIAL MEANING, BECAUSE,  TODAY, WE ARE NOT MERELY  TRANSFERRING POWER FROM ONE  ADMINISTRATION TO ANOTHER, OR  FROM ONE PARTY TO ANOTHER, BUT  WE ARE TRANSFERRING POWER FROM  WASHINGTON, D.C., AND GIVING IT  BACK TO YOU, THE PEOPLE. FOR TOO LONG, A SMALL GROUP IN  OUR NATION'S CAPITAL, HAS  REPEATED THE REWARD OF  GOVERNMENT WHILE THE PEOPLE HAVE BORNE THE COST. WASHINGTON FLOURISHED, BUT THE  PEOPLE DID NOT SHARE IN ITS  WEALTH. POLITICIANS PROSPERED, BUT THE  JOBS LEFT AND THE FACTORIES  CLOSED. THE ESTABLISHMENT PROTECTED  ITSELF, BUT NOT THE CITIZENS OF  OUR COUNTRY. THEIR VICTORIES HAVE NOT BEEN  YOUR VICTORIES. THEIR TRIUMPH IS HAVE NOT BEEN  YOUR TRIUMPHS, AND WHILE THEY  CELEBRATED IN OUR NATION'S  CAPITAL, THERE WAS LITTLE TO  CELEBRATE FOR STRUGGLING  FAMILIES ALL ACROSS OUR LAND. THAT ALL CHANGES STARTING RIGHT  HERE AND RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE THIS MOMENT IS YOUR MOMENT. IT BELONGS TO YOU. IT BELONGS TO EVERYONE GATHERED  HERE TODAY AND EVERYONE WATCHING ALL ACROSS AMERICA. THIS IS YOUR DAY. THIS IS YOUR CELEBRATION. AND THIS, THE UNITED STATES OF  AMERICA, IS YOUR COUNTRY. WHAT TRULY MATTERS IS NOT WHICH  PARTY CONTROLS OUR GOVERNMENT,  BUT WHETHER OUR GOVERNMENT IS  CONTROLLED BY THE PEOPLE. JANUARY 20th, 2017, WILL BE  REMEMBERED AS THE DAY THE PEOPLE BECAME THE RULERS OF THIS NATION AGAIN. THE FORGOTTEN MEN AND WOMEN OF  OUR COUNTRY WILL BE FORGOTTEN NO LONGER. EVERYONE IS LISTENING TO YOU  NOW. YOU CAME BY THE TENS OF MILLIONS TO BECOME PART OF A HISTORIC  MOVEMENT, THE LIKES OF WHICH THE WORLD HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE. AT THE CENTER OF THIS MOVEMENT  IS A CRUCIAL CONVICTION, THAT A  NATION EXISTS TO SERVE ITS  CITIZENS. AMERICANS WANT GREAT SCHOOLS TO  FORTHEIR CHILDREN, SAFE  NEIGHBORHOODS FOR THEIR  FAMILIES, AND GOOD JOBS FOR  THEMSELVES. THESE ARE JUST A REASONABLE  DEMANDS OF RIGHTEOUS PEOPLE AND  A RIGHTEOUS PUBLIC. BUT FOR TOO MANY OF OUR  CITIZENS, A DIFFERENT REALITY  EXISTS. MOTHERS AND CHILDREN TRAPPED IN  POVERTY IN OUR INNER CITIES,  RUSTED OUT FACTORIES SCATTERED  LIKE TOMB STONES ACROSS THE  LANDSCAPE OF OUR NATION. AN EDUCATION SYSTEM, FLUSH WITH  CASH, BUT WHICH LEAVES OUR YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL STUDENTS DEPRIVED  OF ALL KNOWLEDGE AND THE CRIME  AND THE GANGS AND THE DRUGS THAT HAVE STOLEN TOO MANY LIVES AND  ROBBED OUR COUNTRY OF SO MUCH  UNREALIZED POTENTIAL. THIS AMERICAN CARNAGE STOPS  RIGHT HERE AND STOPS RIGHT NOW. WE ARE ONE NATION AND THEIR PAIN IS OUR PAIN. THEIR DREAMS ARE OUR DREAMS. AND THEIR SUCCESS WILL BE OUR  SUCCESS. WE SHARE ONE HEART, ONE HOME,  AND ONE GLORIOUS DESTINY. THE OATH OF OFFICE I TAKE TODAY  IS AN OATH OF ALLEGIANCE TO ALL  AMERICANS. FOR MANY DECADES, WE HAVE  ENRICHED FOREIGN INDUSTRY AT THE EXPENSE OF AMERICAN INDUSTRY,  SUBSIDIZE THE ARMIES OF OTHER  COUNTRIES, WHILE ALLOWING FOR  THE VERY SAD DEPLETION OF OUR  MILITARY. WE HAVE DEFENDED OTHER NATIONS  BORDERS, WHILE REFUSING TO  DEFEND OUR OWN. AND SPENT TRILLIONS AND  TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS OVERSEAS,  WHILE AMERICA'S INFRASTRUCTURE  HAS FALLEN INTO DISREPAIR AND  DECAY. WE HAVE MADE OTHER COUNTRIES  RICH, WHILE THE WEALTH,  STRENGTH, AND CONFIDENCE OF OUR  COUNTRY HAS DISSIPATED OVER THE  HORIZON. ONE BY ONE, THE FACTORIES  SHUDDERED AND LEFT OUR SHORES,  WITH NOT EVEN A THOUGHT ABOUT  THE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF  AMERICAN WORKERS THAT WERE LEFT  BEHIND. THE WEALTH OF OUR MIDDLE CLASS  HAS BEEN RIPPED FROM THEIR HOMES AND THEN REDISTRIBUTED ALL  ACROSS THE WORLD. BUT THAT IS THE PAST. AND, NOW, WE ARE LOOKING ONLY TO THE FUTURE. WE ASSEMBLE HERE TODAY ARE  ISSUING A NEW DEGREE TO BE HEARD IN EVERY CITY, IN EVERY FOREIGN  CAPITAL, AND IN EVERY HALL OF  POWER. FROM THIS DAY FORWARD, A NEW  VISION WILL GOVERN OUR LAND. FROM THIS DAY FORWARD, IT'S  GOING TO BE ONLY AMERICA, FIRST, AMERICA, FIRST. EVERY DECISION ON TRADE, ON  TAXES, ON IMMIGRATION, ON  FOREIGN AFFAIRS, WILL BE MADE TO BENEFIT AMERICAN WORKERS AND  AMERICAN FAMILIES. WE MUST PROTECT OUR BORDERS FROM THE RAVAGES OF OTHER COUNTRIES  MAKING OUR PRODUCTS, STEALING  OUR COMPANIES, AND DESTROYING  OUR JOBS. PROTECTION WILL LEAD TO GREAT  PROSPERITY AND STRENGTH. I WILL FIGHT FOR YOU WITH EVERY  BREATH IN MY BODY AND I WILL  NEVER, EVER LET YOU DOWN. AMERICA WILL START WINNING  AGAIN. WINNING LIKE NEVER BEFORE. WE WILL BRING BACK OUR JOBS. WE WILL BRING BACK OUR BORDERS. WE WILL BRING BACK OUR WEALTH  AND WE WILL BRING BACK OUR  DREAMS.  WE WILL BUILD NEW ROADS AND  HIGHWAYS AND BRIDGES AND  AIRPORTS AND TUNNELS AND  RAILWAYS ALL ACROSS OUR  WONDERFUL NATION. WE WILL GET OUR PEOPLE OFF OF  WELFARE AND BACK TO WORK,  REBUILDING OUR COUNTRY WITH  AMERICAN HANDS AND AMERICAN  LABOR. WE WILL FOLLOW TWO SIMPLE  RULES -- BUY AMERICAN AND HIRE  AMERICAN.  WE WILL SEEK FRIENDSHIP AND  GOOD WILL WITH THE NATIONS OF  THE WORLD, BUT WE DO SO WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT IT IS THE  RIGHT OF ALL NATIONS TO PUT  THEIR OWN INTERESTS FIRST. WE DO NOT SEEK TO IMPOSE OUR WAY OF LIFE ON ANYONE, BUT, RATHER,  TO LET IT SHINE. AS AN EXAMPLE, WE WILL SHINE FOR EVERYONE TO FOLLOW. WE WILL REINFORCE OLD ALLIANCES  AND FORM NEW ONES, AND UNITE THE CIVILIZED WORLD AGAINST RADICAL  ISLAMIC TERRORISM, WHICH WE WILL ERADICATE COMPLETELY FROM THE  FACE OF THE EARTH. AT THE BEDROCK OF OUR POLITICS,  WILL BE A TOTAL ALLEGIANCE TO  THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,  AND THROUGH OUR LOYALTY TO OUR  COUNTRY, WE WILL REDISCOVER OUR  LOYALTY TO EACH OTHER. WHEN YOU OPEN YOUR HEART TO  PATRIOTISM, THERE IS NO ROOM FOR PREJUDICE. THE BIBLE TELLS US HOW GOOD AND  PLEASANT IT IS WHEN GOD'S PEOPLE LIVE TOGETHER IN UNITY. WE MUST SPEAK OUR MINDS OPENLY,  DEBATE OUR DISAGREEMENTS  HONESTLY, BUT ALWAYS PURSUE  SOLIDARITY. WHEN AMERICA IS UNITED, AMERICA  IS TOTALLY UNSTOPPABLE. THERE SHOULD BE NO FEAR. WE ARE PROTECTED AND WE WILL  ALWAYS BE PROTECTED. WE WILL BE PROTECTED BY THE  GREAT MEN AND WOMEN OF OUR  MILITARY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT,  AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE WILL BE PROTECTED BY GOD. FINALLY, WE MUST THINK BIG AND  DREAM EVEN BIGGER. IN AMERICA, WEnd THAT A NATION  IS ONLY LIVING AS LONG AS IT IS  STRIVING. WE WILL NO LONGER ACCEPT  POLITICIANS WHO ARE ALL TALK AND NO ACTION, CONSTANTLY  COMPLAINING, BUT NEVER DOING  ANYTHING ABOUT IT. THE TIME FOR EMPTY TALK IS OVER. NOW ARRIVES THE HOUR OF ACTION. DO NOT ALLOW ANYONE TO TELL YOU  THAT IT CANNOT BE DONE. NO CHALLENGE CAN MATCH THE HEART AND FIGHT AND SPIRIT OF AMERICA. WE WILL NOT FAIL. OUR COUNTRY WILL THRIVE AND  PROSPER AGAIN. WE STAND AT THE BIRTH OF A NEW  MILLENNIUM, READY TO UNLOCK THE  MYSTERIES OF SPACE, TO FREE THE  EARTH FROM THE MISEIES OF  DISEASE AND TO HARNESS THE  INDUSTRIES AND TECHNOLOGIES OF  TOMORROW. A NEW NATIONAL PRIDE WILL LIFT  OUR SOULS AND SIGHTS AND HEAL  OUR DIVISIONS. IT'S TIME TO REMEMBER THAT OLD  WISDOM, OUR SOLDIERS WILL NEVER  FORGET, THAT WHETHER WE ARE  BLACK OR BROWN OR WHITE, WE ALL  BLEED THE SAME RED BLOOD OF  PATRIOTS. WE ALL ENJOY THE SAME GLORIOUS  FREEDOMS AND WE ALL SALUTE THE  SAME GREAT AMERICAN FLAGS. AND WHETHER A CHILD IS BORN IN  THE URBAN SPRAWL OF DETROIT OR  THE WIND-SWEPT PLAINS OF  NEBRASKA, THEY LOOK UP AT THE  SAME NIGHT SKY, THEY FILL THEIR  HEART WITH THE SAME DREAMS, AND  THEY ARE INFUSED WITH THE BREATH OF LIFE BY THE SAME ALMIGHTY  CREATOR. SO TO ALL AMERICANS IN EVERY  CITY NEAR AND FAR, SMALL AND  LARGE, FROM MOUNTAIN TO  MOUNTAIN, FROM OCEAN TO OCEAN,  HEAR THESE WORDS -- YOU WILL  NEVER BE IGNORED AGAIN.  YOUR VOICE, YOUR HOPES, AND  YOUR DREAMS WILL DEFINE OUR  AMERICAN DESTINY AND YOUR  COURAGE AND GOODNESS AND LOVE  WILL FOREVER GUIDE US ALONG THE  WAY. TOGETHER, WE WILL MAKE AMERICA  STRONG AGAIN. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA WEALTHY  AGAIN. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA PROUD  AGAIN. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN, AND, YES, TOGETHER, WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. THANK YOU. GOD BLESS YOU! AND GOD BLESS AMERICA! THANK YOU. >> THE PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP  CONCLUDING ABOUT A 16-MINUTE  REMARKS THERE IN A SPEECH THAT,  IN MANY WAYS, WAS TAKEN FROM THE PAGES OF MANY OF THE CAMPAIGN  SPEECHES WE HEARD ON THE ROAD  AND HE IS BEING GREETED THERE BY PRESIDENT OBAMA, WHO, AT TIMES,  SEEMED TO BE BITING HIS LIP.  >> I HAVE TO SAY, IT WAS  SURPRISINGLY DIVISIVE FOR AN  INAUGURAL ADDRESS AND I SAY IT  THIS WAY.

AS OUR ANCESTORS HAVE PLANTED  FOR US, SO WE MUST PLANT FOR  OTHERS. WHILE IT IS NOT FOR US TO  COMPLETE THE TASK, NEITHER ARE  WE FREE TO DESIST FROM THEM. DISPENSE JUSTICE FOR THE NEEDY  AND THE ORPHAN, FOR THEY HAVE NO ONE BUT THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS. AND BECAUSE A NATION'S WEALTH IS MEASURED BY HER VALUES, AND NOT  BY HER VAULTS. BLESS ALL OF OUR ALLIES AROUND  THE WORLD WHO SHARE OUR BELIEFS, BY THE RIVERS OF BABYLON, WE  WEPT AS WE REMEMBERED ZION. IF I FORGET THE OLD JERUSALEM,  MAY MY RIGHT HAND FORGET ITS  SKILL. THE DOER OF ALL THESE SHALL  NEVER FALTER. MAY THE DAYS COME SOON WHEN  JUSTICE WILL DWELL IN THE  WILDERNESS AND RIGHTEOUSNESS  WILL ABIDE IN THE FERTILE FIELD, AND THE WORK OF RIGHTEOUSNESS  WILL BE PEACE, QUIETNESS, AND  CONFIDENT FOREVER. AMEN. >>> MR. PRESIDENT, IN THE BIBLE  BLESSING. AND IT STARTED TO RAIN, MR.  AND IT'S MY PRAYER THAT GOD WILL BLESS YOU, YOUR FAMILY, YOUR  ADMINISTRATION, AND MAY HE BLESS AMERICA.

FOR TEAMS FOR ALL OF THOSE IN  AUTHORITY THAT WE MAY LIVE  PEACEFUL AND QUIET LIVES IN ALL  GODLINESS AND HOLLINESS. THIS IS GOOD AND IT PLEASES GOD, OUR SAVIOR, WHO WANTS ALL PEOPLE TO BE SAVED AND COME TO A  KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH. FOR THERE IS ONE GOD AND ONE  MEDIATOR BETWEEN GOD AND  MANSIGNED, THE MAN CHRIST JESUS  WHO GAVE HIMSELF AS A RANSOM FOR ALL PEOPLE. NOW TO THE KING ETERNAL. IMMORAL, INVISIBLE.

THEY WILL LEAVE ALONG WITH THE  OBAMA'S AND BIDEN'S AND VICE  PRESIDENT MIKE AND KAREN PENCE. THE PRESIDENT GREETING MEMBERS  ON THE PLATFORM HERE. WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT,  THEY WILL RETREAT INSIDE THE  CAPITOL AND THERE WILL BE A  DEPARTURE CEREMONY FOR FORMER  PRESIDENT OBAMA AND FORMER FIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA. THEY ARE ON THEIR WAY TO  CALIFORNIA FOR VACATION. THEY WILL BE BOARDING A  HELICOPTER THAT WILL LOOK QUITE  FAMILIAR BUT IT WILL HAVE A  DIFFERENT CALL SIGN THAN THE ONE THEY HAVE BEEN ON LAST EIGHT  YEARS. THE PRESIDENT IS GREETING THE  DOLE'S, BOB DOLE.  >> BOTH OF THEM GIVING THE  DOLE'S -- PRESIDENT OBAMA ALSO  THERE TO GREET THEM. >> THERE IS PRESIDENT TRUMP  WALKING THROUGH THE CAPITOL FOR  THE FIRST TIME AS PRESIDENT. EVERYTHING TODAY WILL BE THE  FIRST TIME AS PRESIDENT. >> LESTER, WE WERE TALKING  EARLIER. IT IS DIFFICULT TO BOTH CHANNEL  WHAT THE SUPPORTERS WANT TO HEAR AND SOMETIMES TRY TO BRING THE  MOMENT OF UNITY AND IT'S NOT --  YOU CAN'T DO BOTH SOMETIMES. AND I THINK THAT HE WANTED --  THAT CLEARLY WAS AN INAUGURAL  THAT WAS INTENDED FOR PEOPLE.  >> A WOMAN WHO HAS LOOKED AT A  LOT OF INAUGURAL ADDRESSES AND  MIGHT HAVE SOME FRAME OF  REFERENCE IS DORIS GOODSON. THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US,  DORIS.  >> THANK YOU.  >> AS I HAD NOTED, A LOT OF THE  THEMES WE HEARD IN THAT  INAUGURAL ADDRESS WERE STRAIGHT  FROM THE CAMPAIGN. CLEARLY TRUE TO WHAT GOT IN HERE AND SPEAKING TO THE BASE. WHAT DID YOU NOTE ABOUT HIS  SPEECH? >> WELL, I THINK ON THE ONE  HAND, IT PROBABLY WAS THE BEST  CAMPAIGN SPEECH HE EVER MADE IN  THE SENSE THAT IT WASN'T I, I,  I, AS HE USUALLY TALKED ABOUT. HE JUST MENTIONED WE ARE PART OF A MOVEMENT AND I WILL FIGHT FOR  YOU FOR EVERY BREATH OF ME WAS  ONE OF FEW TIMES HE BROUGHT THE  ""I"" IN. I AGREE WITH YOU A CAMPAIGN  SPEECH TO HIS SUPPORTERS WILL  LOVE IT. HE WAS SIMPLE AND DECLARATIVE  BUT HE MADE ENEMIES AS POPULISM  ALWAYS DOES. ONE IS THE CAPITOL HILL AND THE  POLITICIAN ESTABLISHMENT AND THE OTHER WAS THE WORLD AT LARGE. SOMEHOW, HE WAS SAYING AMERICA  IS GETTING ITSELF LOST BY  HELPING OTHER COUNTRIES BECOME  RICH WHILE OUR MIDDLE CLASS IS  BEING SQUEEZED. NO MENTION OF REDISTRIBUTION OF  INCOME WITHIN THE UNITED STATES  AND THEN I THINK AMERICA FIRST  IS A TROUBLING MEMORY. OBVIOUSLY, ISOLATIONIST BEFORE  WORLD WAR II AND TO USE THAT AS  A SLOGAN CONJURES UP THOSE SCARY NOTIONS OF OUR NOT HAVING  ALLIANCES, EVEN THOUGH HE  MENTIONED ALIGN LIANCES NEAR THE END. FDR BROUGHT THAT UP AND STILL IT WAS INTERESTING.  >> I FOUND MYSELF SQUIRMING AT  TIMES BECAUSE HE WAS INDICTING  MANY OF THE PEOPLE HE SHARED THE PLATFORM WITH AND CLEARLY BY  DESIGN BUT HEART OF HIS  CAMPAIGN. YOU DID FEEL AWKWARD AT TIMES  THERE, CHUCK? >> IT WAS AWKWARD BECAUSE I  GUESS I EXPECTED A LITTLE BIT  MORE OF AN EFFORT TO -- I  THOUGHT MICHAEL GERSON SAID THIS EARLIER. A COLUMNIST ON ""THE WASHINGTON  POST."" HE WAS CRITICIZING DONALD TRUMP  AND SAID SOMETIMES IT FEELS AS  IF HE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE AMERICAN STORY ENOUGH AND HE THOUGHT IN THE WAY HE HANDLED  THE JOHN LEWIS SITUATION. I WAS LISTENING TO THAT SPEECH  TODAY AND SOMEHOW IT FELT DI  CONNECTED A LITTLE BIT FROM THE  AMERICAN STORY AND I UNDERSTAND. I THOUGHT DORIS MADE A GOOD  POINT. YOU CAN'T FORGET WHO YOU'RE  RUNNING AGAINST AND THAT WAS IN  THAT INAUGURAL. IF HE WAS LOOKING TO BUILD  POLITICAL CAPITALISM I DON'T  THINK HE DID.  >> TOM BROKAW, ANY OF THOSE  UNCOMFORTABLE WITH A PRESIDENT  TRUMP? ANYTHING THEY CAN TAKE AS A --  >> YOU'D HAVE TO TALK TO THEM. I THINK WHAT HE DID WAS THIS WAS THE CORE DONALD TRUMP. I MEAN, HE REACHED OUT TO THOSE  PEOPLE WHO WERE IN MIKA  BRZEZINSKI -- McCOMB COUNTY,  MICHIGAN. BUT AMERICA IS DIFFERENT THAN  THAT BECAUSE OF ITS VOTER  TAPESTRY. THE AUTO INDUSTRY IS CHARGING  ALONG. OIL PRICE AS LOW AS IN THE PAST  25 YEARS PEN THERE IS A RECOVERY UNDERWAY AND NO QUESTION ABOUT  THAT. THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY HE HAS  IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE NOW, HE  JUST TURNED AROUND AND KIND OF  HEAD SLAPPED THEM BECAUSE ED  THESE POLITICIANS IN WASHINGTON, THEY JUST WANT TO TAKE AND DON'T WANT TO GIVE YOU ANYTHING. IT SEEMS TO ME A VERY HARD DOOR  TO OPEN AND GOES BACK TO WHAT  HAPPENED WHEN HE CAME TO SEE THE SENATE LEADERSHIP WHEN IT WAS  CLEAR HE MIGHT GET THE  NOMINATION. THE SENATE LEADERSHIP SAID HE  WAS PRETTY GOOD AT THE BEGINNING AND THEN WHEN WE SAID TO HIM, WE WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT SOME  ISSUES THAT WE HAVE FOR YOU, HE  SAID, NO, I'M NOT HERE ABOUT  THAT. I PUT ON A SHOW. THAT'S WHY PEOPLE -- THIS IS A  QUOTE FROM SOMEBODY WHO WAS IN  THE ROOM. A SENIOR MEMBER OF THE  REPUBLICAN SENATE LEADERSHIP. I PUT ON A SHOW. YOU GUYS DON'T GET ME. SO I SEE WHAT HE SAID TODAY WAS  MUST PUT ON A SHOW FOR HIS CORE  ROOT WHO DID GET HIM THERE BUT  HOW YOU PUT THE COUNTRY BACK  TOGETHER AGAIN AND GET EVERYBODY MOVING THE SAME WAY, AM I OFF  BASE HERE? >> NO. I RESONATE WITH EVERYTHING YOU  SAY. I WAS SURPRISED. AGAIN, I'M AS SURPRISED TODAY AS I WAS ON ELECTION NIGHT. I EXPECTED A LOT MORE JOY. I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH HOW  AUTHENTIC AND QUINTESSENTIALLY  DONALD J. TRUMP AND IT WAS GRIM. ON INAUGURAL DAY THERE IS  TYPICALLY MORE JOY ON THE PODIUM THAN THERE WAS TODAY AND  TYPICALLY MORE COMING TOGETHER.  >> HUGH, I THINK MANY PEOPLE  WERE HOPEFUL HE WOULD TAKE A  PAGE OFF YOUR OLD BOSS' BOOK,  RICHARD NIXON IN '69. IT WAS A DIVISIVE CAMPAIGN. IT WAS A DIVIDED COUNTRY AND  ANGRY COUNTRY. NO DOUBT A MOMENT LIKE THIS AND  HE WENT -- HE DECIDED TO GO UP.  >> LET ME ASK YOU THIS. FOR A LONG TIME, PRESIDENT OBAMA WOULD LOOK BACK AND SAY, WELL,  THE PROBLEMS WERE STARTED BEFORE I GOT HERE. HE WOULD REMIND US OF WHAT HE  INHERITED. DONALD TRUMP GAVE A VERY  FULL-THROAT SPEECH THERE ABOUT  AMERICA IS GOING TO BE GREAT  AGAIN. HOW LONG DOES HE HAVE BEFORE HE  OWNS IT? >> HE GETS NINE MONTHS TO TO DO  THINGS AND THAT WAS DEFINITELY A CALL TO ARMS TO THE MEMBER OF  CONGRESS THERE, WE ARE NOT  SCREWING AROUND AND THIS NOT  CUMBAYAH BUT EMBRACING FOR  PEOPLE MUCH LIKE ME WHO HE HAD  SOMETHING TO SAY DID WASHINGTON  THE CENTER OF THE ALLEGIANCE AND THE DAVOS MAN NOT UNDERSTANDING  THE AVERAGE AMERICAN MAN BUT  SOMETIMES YOU CAN PUT HONEY ON  THERE.  >> YOU'RE WATCHING THE ROLE  REVERSAL THERE IN ALL ITS GLORY  THERE AS PRESIDENT TRUMP NOW  WALKS THE OTHER WAY WITH FORMER  PRESIDENT OBAMA AND THEY WILL  SOON BE SENDING OBAMA'S OFF SO  WE WILL WATCH THAT PLAY OUT  HERE.  >> HE JUST PAINTED A PICTURE  THAT I THINK MANY AMERICANS  DON'T RECOGNIZE. THERE ARE SOME AMERICANS WHO  THINK THAT IS THE PICTURE AND  SOME WILL SAY HE IS PAINTING A  WAR PICTURE AND DIFFERENT  REALITY AND THIS GOES TO THE  IDEA THERE HAVE BEEN TWO  AMERICAS. HE ONLY PAINTED A PICTURE OF ONE OF THEM.  >> A VERY IMPORTANT DISTINCTION  HE FAILED TO MAKE. HE NOT THE PRESIDENT OF THE  ELECTORAL COLLEGE BUT THE  PRESIDENT OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY  AND THE FACT HE CAME UP SHORT 3  MILLION VOTES AND THE WINS HE  HAD IN THE IMPORTANT ELECTORAL  COLLEGE STATES WERE REASONABLY  NARROW AND THINGS ARE COMING  AROUND A LITTLE BIT IN THOSE  AREAS. NOT JUST THE ECONOMY BUT THE  FACT THEY DID WANT SOME CHANGE  BUT IS THIS THE CHANGE THEY  WANT? >> LET ME QUICKLY POINT OUT WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT. THE HELICOPTER IS OFTEN KNOWN AS MARINE ONE WHEN THE PRESIDENT IS ON BOARD THAT WILL TAKE THE  FORMER FIRST FAMILY AWAY. YOU CAN SEE THE FOLKS GATHERING  FOR THE OFFICIAL SEND-OFF. AS WE WATCH THAT, LET'S GO TO  KRISTEN WELKER THERE ON THE  PLATFORM WITH SOME REACTION TO  PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SPEECH.  >> HI THERE, LESTER.  >> Reporter: I'M HERE WITH  SENATOR DAVID PERDUE OF GEORGIA. THE COUSIN OF GOVERNOR OF  PERDUE -- FORMER GOVERNOR WHO  WAS NOMINATED TO BE THE  AGRICULTURE SECRETARY. YOUR REACTION TO THAT SPEECH. SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT IT FELT A  LITTLE BIT LIKE THE CAMPAIGN  SPEECH AT THE END. DID YOU FEEL IT WAS UNIFYING  ENOUGH? >> HE IS AN OUTSIDER AND A  DIFFERENT APPROACH TODAY BUT  WHAT ED IS THE AMERICA BELONGS  TO THE PEOPLE AND THE GOVERNMENT BELONGS TO THE PEOPLE. SAINTS THAT WHAT WE ARE REALLY  ALL ABOUT? HE CALLED ON CONGRESS TO GET  THINGS DONE AND GET TO WORK. THIS IS A GUY USED TO GETTING  RESULTS. I WALK AWAY FROM HIM LISTENING  TO ONE THING. HE IS CALLING FOR UNITY AND  STAND SHOULDER-TO-SHOULDER AND  INDEPENDENT OF YOUR POLITICAL  PERSUASION AND LET'S PULL  TOGETHER AND MAKE AMERICA GREAT  AGAIN.  >> YOU SAY UNITY BUT TO SOME OF  THE DEMOCRATS THEY MAY NOT HAVE  HEARD THAT? >> YES.  >> Reporter: I'M GETTING A HARD  WRAP. THANK YOU, SENATOR. LESTER, BACK TO YOU.  >> KRISTEN, THANK YOU. THERE IS FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA  AND PRESIDENT TRUMP HERE FOR THE DEPARTURE OF THE OBAMA'S. TYPICALLY, WE HAVE SEEN FORMER  PRESIDENTS FLY OUT OF WASHINGTON TO THEIR NEXT HOMES AND IN THIS  CASE, THEY ARE OFF TO VACATION  IN PALM SPRINGS. AND IT WILL BE A ROUND TRIP. THEY WILL RETURN TO WASHINGTON,  D.C. TO BEGIN THEIR LIFE  POST-WHITE HOUSE.  >> SINCE REAGAN AND JIMMY  CARTER, WE HAVE TWO PRESIDENTS  LIVING IN WASHINGTON AT THE SAME TIME THAT CARTER STAYED TO MAKE  SURE AMY CARTER GOT THROUGH  SCHOOL AND SIMILAR REASON WHY  THE OBAMA'S ARE STAYING IN  WASHINGTON.  >> THE BIDEN IS TO WISH THEIR  GOOD-BYES AS WELL. THIS IS A SYMBOLIC MOMENT. WE HAVE SEEN THE OFFICIAL MOMENT BUT A SYMBOLIC MOMENT WITH A  CONTINUATION OF THE TRANSFER OF  POWER. LET'S LISTEN A BIT. >> THE BIDEN'S GET ON THE TRAIN. THEY HAVE THE BUS COMMUTE IN  WASHINGTON FOR A COUPLE OF. THEY GET ON AMTRAK AND RIDE IT  TO THE SECOND STOP, BALTIMORE,  AND THEN WILMINGTON. JOE HAS BEEN DOING THROUGHOUT  HIS SENATE CAREER AND ALSO HIS  VICE PRESIDENTIAL TIME.  >> HUGS AND KISSES ALL AROUND. WE CERTAINLY KNOW THAT THE  OBAMA'S AND THE BIDEN'S HAVE  BECOME LIFELONG FRIENDS. THERE IS A VERY, VERY CLOSE BOND THERE AND WE HE SAW THAT WITH  THE MEDAL OF FREEDOM OF  DISTINCTION AWARDED BY THE  FORMER PRESIDENT, THE FORMER  VICE PRESIDENT. I'LL GET THIS RIGHT. THIS IS LIKE WHEN YOU GET TO THE NEW YEAR, YOU KEEP WRITING THE  LAST YEAR WHEN YOU WRITE A  CHECK. I'M GOING THAT PROCESS NOW SO  FORGIVE ME. . APPEARS THE BIDEN'S WILL BE  DEPARTING FIRST IN A MOTORCADE. >> HE IS GOING TO BE SETTING UP  SHOP AT UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE  AND PENN. PENN WILL BE WHERE WITH HE'LL  PURSUE SOME INTEREST IN ""NIGHTLY NEWS"" -- INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS  AND UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE.  >> A LOT OF PEOPLE LOOK AND  WONDER WHAT IF.  >> I DON'T THINK JOE BIDEN IS  DONE. A TIME WHEN YOU'RE IN YOUR 70s,  IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH TO RUN  FOR PRESIDENT ANY MORE. DONALD TRUMP GOT ELECTED AT 70.  >> HE WILL BE THE OLDEST.  >> JOE IS OLDER THAN 70.  >> HE WILL BE 78 IN 2020 AND  DONALD TRUMP WOULD BE 74. I HAVE TO TO SAY I DIDN'T THINK  WE WOULD HAVE THREE STRAIGHT  BABY BOOMER PRESIDENTS AND  TECHNICAL FOUR BUT I DON'T  ACCOUNT OBAMA A FULL BABY  BOOMER.  >> THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 70 AND 78, AS I WILL TELL YOU.  >> TOM, I THINK A LOT OF RUN,  TOM, RUN FOR YOU. YOU NEVER KNOW, BUDDY.  >> ALSO THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS  GOING TO HAVE TO RAISE A NEW  GENERATION. THE FACT IS WHAT THEY HAVE GOT  TO DO IS FIND THE NEXT  GENERATION OF LEADERSHIP IN THE  DEMOCRATIC PARTY, EVEN WITH NEW  IDEAS AND THE SAME WAY BILL  CLINTON CAME UP. AND JOE BIDEN, IN FACT, WAS PART OF THAT REINVENTION OF THE  DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THE CASE  BEFORE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.  >> THEY HAVE SOME HISTORY. CAM LA HARRIS AND CHRIS MURPHY,  THEY HAVE VERY GOOD TALENTED  YOUNG PEOPLE BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE TALENT OF THAT COUPLE,  PRESIDENT AND MRS. OBAMA ARE  UNIQUELY GIFTED SO THERE IS  ALWAYS GOING TO BE A GAP BETWEEN WHAT FOLLOWS THEM. >> PRESIDENT OBAMA JUST KIND OF  SEEMS TO BE TAKING IT ALL IN, AS HE AND THE FORMER FIRST LADY  PREPARE TO DEPART THE CAPITOL BY HELICOPTER. THEY WILL BE GOING THE SHORT  DISTANCE TO JOINT BASE ANDREW TO BOARD A VIP AIR FORCE JET. IT WILL NOT BE KNOWN AS AIR  FORCE ONE BUT AIR FORCE JET  NONETHELESS TO TAKE THEM TO  CALIFORNIA FOR VACATION.  >> HE IS LIKELY TO MAKE SOME  REMARKS THERE TO STAFFERS,  FORMER STAFFERS.  >> THERE HAS TO BE A LOT OF  EMOTIONS. A LOT OF -- CERTAINLY A LOT OF  NOSTALGIA. IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN EASY AT  TIMES TO HEAR SOME OF THE THINGS SAID IN THAT SPEECH. BUT THE PRESIDENT HAS, FORMER  PRESIDENT HAS TAKEN THE HIGH  ROAD CERTAINLY IN THIS  TRANSITION.  >> HERE IS A LEAD PARAGRAPH IN  ""WALL STREET JOURNAL"" TODAY. AFTER EIGHT YEARS IN OFFICE,  BARACK OBAMA HAS A MARKET RECORD AND A RED BLOODED AMERICAN  CAPITALIST COULD BE PROUD OF. OIL PRICES HAVE COME DOWN AND  BORROWIZING CHEAP AND PROFITS  ARE UP ALONG WITH THE DOLLAR. EVEN THOSE WHO BET AGAINST  PRESIDENT OBAMA MADE GOOD MONEY  WITH RETURNS IN THEIR  INVESTMENT. NOW THAT THE INVESTMENT GROUP. ALONG WITH THAT CAME JOBS. WE KNOW THAT THERE HAS BEEN A  RECOVERY. IT'S IMPERFECT. IT'S GOT HOLES IN IT BUT THE  FACT IS IT'S NOT NEARLY AS GRIM  AS THE SPEECH WE HEARD TODAY.  >> HE IS SPEAKING TO THE PEGGY  NOONAN UNPROTECT TODAY.  >> LET'S TAKE IN THIS MOMENT AS  FORMER PRESIDENT IS SALUTING  CREW MEMBERS. THE LAST TIME THAT WE EXPECTLY  BOARD THAT HELICOPTER AND MAKE  THAT WAVE. CHRIS JANSING IS OUT THERE ON  THAT EAST FRONT OF THE CAPITAL. WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO  OBSERVE THERE.  >> THIS IS AN EMOTIONAL TIME FOR THE PEOPLE WHO LOVE THE OBAMA'S  AND SUPPORTED THE OBAMA'S. THEY NOW BEGIN THEIR  POST-PRESIDENTIAL LIFE. IT'S DESCRIBED, THIS MOMENT, IN  A HANDBOOK FOR THE INAUGURATION  THAT DATES BACK TO 1889 WHICH  SAYS THE PRESIDENT LEAVES THE  CAPITOL AS FAST AS IS  PRACTICABLE AFTER THE  INAUGURATION OF HIS SUCCESSOR. WHAT IT DOESN'T DESCRIBE IS WHAT THIS MEANS TO THE COUNTRY, THIS  MOMENT, THIS DAY THAT IS ALL  ABOUT DONALD J. TRUMP. THIS MOMENT IS ABOUT TWO PEOPLE  WHO HAVE SERVED THEIR COUNTRY  FOR EIGHT YEARS. GETTING ON THAT HELICOPTER, AS  YOU SAY, FOR THE LAST TIME AND  GOING OFF AT A NEW LIFE THAT IS  A YOUNG AGE FOR THE PRESIDENT 55 AND 53 FOR THE FIRST LADY. THEY WILL GO TO THE FORMER AIR  FORCE ONE, NOW CALLED EXECUTIVE  ONE. I WANT TO JUST POINT OUT THAT  SOMETHING HAPPENED HERE THAT WAS A TRADITION THE OBAMA'S STARTED. IT USED TO BE THAT THE GOOD-BYES WERE SAID UP ON THE STEPS. AS A SIGN OF RESPECT, EIGHT  YEARS AGO, PRESIDENT OBAMA  WALKED TO THE HOSPITAL WITH THE  BUSH'S AND NOT JUST SAID  GOOD-BYE THERE, BUT AS WAS NOTED AT THE TIME HE ACTUALLY HUGGED  GEORGE W. BUSH AFTER WHAT HAD  BEEN A LONG AND DIFFICULT  CAMPAIGN. HE HAD REALLY MADE A STATEMENT  THAT HE APPRECIATED THE WAY THAT THE TRANSITION WAS HANDLED, JUST AS DONALD TRUMP HAS SAID THAT. SO PERHAPS WE HAVE SEEN A NEW  KIND OF FAREWELL AS WE SEE THE  PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT  WAVE, THAT THEY WILL ESCORT THEM TO THE HELICOPTER AS THEY MAKE  THEIR WAY TO THEIR NEW LIFE. LESTER? >> I SPOKE TO PRESIDENT OBAMA A  LITTLE OVER A WEEK AGO WHO SAID  TO ME THAT HE THINKS THE COUNTRY IS IN A BETTER PLACE THAN WHAT  IT WAS WHEN HE TOOK OVER AND BY  MANY MEASURES THAT HE INHERITED  A COUNTRY WITH A BRINK OF A  FINANCIAL DISASTER, SHEDDING  JOBS, BUT HE CERTAINLY HAS BEEN  OPEN TO CRITICS OF HIS FOREIGN  POLICY AND SOME OF THE EXECUTIVE ACTIONS HE HAS TAKEN.  >> IRONICALLY, TOWARD THE END  HERE THE PROGRESS THE AMERICAN  MILITARY HAS MADE AGAINST ISIS,  PARTICULARLY IN IRAQ, HAS BEEN  IMPRESSIVE. EVEN AT THE END HERE. WHAT HE GOT HIT FOR EARLY, YOU  MIGHT SEE THAT STRATEGY THAT  PRESIDENT TRUMP KEEPS IT IN  PLACE BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY -- IT  SEEMS TO BE WORKING.  >> BUT I DIRECT YOU TO THE  SPEECH, THOUGH. HE SAID --  >> I'M AWARE OF WHAT IT SAID.  >> WE WILL ERADICATE RADICAL  ISLAMIC FROM THE FACE OF THE  EARTH. FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH,  ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE TALKING  ABOUT AN IDEOLOGY. NONETHELESS, ED IT. WHEN I DID A TOUR THIS PAST WEEK TALKING TO PEOPLE AROUND THE  COUNTRY, BOTH FOR AND AGAINST,  MR. TRUMP, PRESIDENT TRUMP, THEY WANT HIM TO MOVE QUICKLY AND  BELIEVE IN HIS PROMISES AND WANT TO SEE IT AND PEOPLE GAVE  VARIOUS TIMES AS TO WHEN THEY  WANTED TO DO TOS IT. THERE IS THE PICTURE OF THE  OBAMA'S LEAVING OFFICIAL  WASHINGTON BEHIND.  >> WE ARE WATCHING IT RIGHT OVER OUR WINDOW. IT'S COMING --  >> THEY ARE COMING RIGHT TO IT! >> COMING OVER OUR STUDIO HERE.  >> WE WILL FIND OUT IN THE  MEMOIRS WHAT THEY ARE SAYING TO  EACH OTHER AND WHAT THEY ARE  THINKING. A NICE SHOT. THEY TAKE THE PRESIDENT AROUND  SO HE GETS TO SEE --  >> NO, WHAT THEY ARE SAYING. LOOK, THERE IS LESTER HOLT RIGHT THERE! >> DO YOU THINK? NO. >> THERE HAS TO BE A MIXTURE OF  RELIEF. I SUPPOSE SOME REGRET. HE TALKS ABOUT SOME OF THE  REGRETS IN OFFICE. HE WISHES THAT HE HAD DONE MORE  TO ORGANIZE THE GRASSROOTS WHEN  TALKING ABOUT THE DEMOCRATIC  LOSS, THE LOSS OF HILLARY  CLINTON. HE TOLD ME HE WAS SURPRISED THAT HIS POPULARITY ON THE CAMPAIGN  TRAIL DID NOT TRANSLATE TO HER. SO THERE IS SOME REGRET ABOUT  THAT. THERE IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE  SOMETHING YOU DIDN'T GET TO OR  SOMETHING YOU WISH YOU HAD SPENT BILL CLINTON TOOK A LONG TIME AT THE HANGAR, IF YOU'LL RECALL.  >> OH, MY GOODNESS.  >> I WONDER IF HE'LL RESPOND TO  PRESIDENT TRUMPAR? >> I DON'T KNOW.  >> WE COULD NOT GET OFF THE AIR  ON THAT DAY! I REMEMBER IT! >> LISTEN. THE PRESIDENT SPOKE. HE WASN'T NECESSARILY SPEAKING  TO ALL OF US IN THIS ROOM. HE WAS SPEAKING TO THE PEOPLE  AND LET'S GET OUT TO JACOB WHO  IS OUT ON THE WASHINGTON MALL  WITH SOME REACTION FROM THE  FOLKS WHO CAME FROM, IN SOME  CASES, A LONG WAY TO HEAR AND  SEE THIS MOMENT. JACOB? >> Reporter: HEY, HOW ARE YOU,  LESTER? I'M HERE WITH PAM AND JACKIE WHO ARE FROM PITTSBURGH. TWO OF THE I GUESS, HUNDREDS OF  THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW  LEAVING THE NATIONAL MALL. THEY ARE DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTERS THROUGH AND THROUGH. WE JUST STOOD HERE AND WATCHED  FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA TAKE OFF  AND THEY CAME HERE SPECIFICALLY  TO HEAR PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP  MAKE THOSE REMARKS. I GOT TO ASK YOU, PAM, WHAT DID  YOU THINK? >> I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT. I THINK HE WILL BE AN AMAZING  PRESIDENT AND I -- FOR THE  COUNTRY.  >> JACKIE, YOU CAME HERE FROM  PITTSBURGH. A VERY IMPORTANT PLACE FOR  DONALD TRUMP. WHAT WAS YOUR MOST MEMORABLE  PART OF THE SPEECH? >> OH, YEAH. AND HE USED SOMETHING, HE USED  THE WORD GOD WHICH IS SOMETHING  NOT DONE FROM THE PRESIDENT.  >> WERE YOU SURPRISED TO HEAR  THAT FROM DONALD TRUMP? >> I WAS, I WAS. BUT, YOU KNOW? >> PAM, JACKIE, THANK YOU BOTH  VERY MUCH. LESTER, JUST TWO, LIKE I SAID,  OF THE MANY DONALD TRUMP  SUPPORTERS OUT HERE HEADING  TOWARDS THAT PARADE WHICH STARTS AROUND 3:00.  >> JACOB, THANK YOU. WE CONTINUE TO WATCH FORMER  PRESIDENT AND FORMER FIRST LADY  OBAMA MAKE THEIR WAY OUT OF  OFFICIAL WASHINGTON AND BOARD  THAT HELICOPTER CARRYING THEM TO JOINT BASE ANDREWS, WHERE WE DO  EXPECT TO HEAR FROM MR. OBAMA  BEFORE THE FAMILY DEPARTS ON A  VACATION IN A MUCH WARMER  CLIMATE.  >> SOMETHING STRUCK ME THERE BY  THE PERSON THAT JACOB WAS  INTERVIEWING WHEN SHE SAID SHE  HADN'T HEARD GOD BEFORE UP  THERE, HADN'T HEARD THAT IN A  WHILE. I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER HEARD A  PRESIDENT SPEAK AND NOT SAY GOD  BLESS AMERICA AFTER EVERY SINGLE SPEECH. THE POINT IS IT SORT OF GETS AT  THERE WERE TWO VERSIONS OF THE  OBAMA PRESIDENCY THAT THE PUBLIC SAW. THERE IS A VERSION THAT ONE  PUBLIC SAW AND A VERSION THE  OTHER THINKS THEY SAW OR  PERCEIVED. BOY, IT IS THAT PERCEIVED DIVIDE HERE, ALMOST AN INFORMATIONAL  DIVIDE. A WOMAN IN THERE TRULY BELIEVES  SHE HAD NOT HEARD PRESIDENTS  TALK ABOUT GOD UP THERE ANY  MORE. THAT'S JUST NOT -- IT'S JUST NOT TRUE BUT I THINK IT SORT OF  SURFACES THE INFORMATION DIVIDE  WE HAVE.  >> SHE PLAINLY WAS VERY  ENTHUSIASTIC.  >> OF COURSE. I TAKE NOTHING AWAY FROM THAT.  >> A SUPPORTER OF DONALD TRUMP. IT WAS THOSE KIND OF VOTERS THAT GOT HIM TO WHERE HE IS. NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. WHAT I DON'T KNOW IS WHAT IS  GOING ON SOCIAL MEDIA. MY GUESS HE IS GETTING A WELL  DONE, HIGH FIVE'S AND THOSE  IDIOTS ON TELEVISION, BROKAW AND OTHERS DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE  TALKING ABOUT.  >> THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND  AMERICA.  >> THAT IS WHAT IS GOING ON OUT  THERE, THEY DON'T GET IT.  >> THIS IS SANCTUARY HALL -- I'M SORRY. STATWARY HALL WHERE THERE IS A  LUNCHEON. WE ONLY CAN SHOW YOU A PORTION  AS THE CAMERAS ARE SHUT DOWN AS  THE GUESTS ARE SEATED FOR THE  LUNCHEON. TAMMY IS INSIDE THE CAPITOL.  >> WE ARE OUT HERE IN NAPLES. HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE BIG TRUMP  SUPPORTERS. THIS HAS BEEN A LIVELY CROWD AND SOME OF THE LIVELIEST ARE THESE  LADIES OVER HERE. TELL ME WHAT TODAY HAS MEANT TO  YOU.  >> OH, IT'S THRILLING. IT'S THRILLING THAT WE CAN COME  TOGETHER AS AMERICANS AND UNITE  ON MAKING AMERICAN GREAT AGAIN. WE ARE SO PLEASED. >> YES.  >> THAT IS VERY THRILLING. I'M SO HAPPY TO BE HERE. THIS HAS BEEN A GREAT  EXPERIENCE. MY FIRST. >> LESTER, IF WE COULD GO OUT  OVER HERE. THIS MOMENT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME COMING FOR MANY PEOPLE. MATTHEW, YOU ARE A DIE-HARD  TRUMP SUPPORTER. WHAT DOES TODAY MEAN TO YOU? >> I THINK IT'S A GREAT  CELEBRATION OF AMERICA. I MEAN, THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY  FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY TO COME  TOGETHER, UNIFY, PEACEFUL  TRANSITION OF POWER. AND WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE  CHANGES ABOUT TO TAKE PLACE.  >> Reporter: HOW DID YOU FEEL  ABOUT HIS INAUGURATION SPEECH? >> I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY  HONEST AND I THOUGHT IT WAS TO  THE POINT. I DON'T THINK THAT IT WAS  POLITICAL. AND I LIKE THAT. I THOUGHT IT WAS BLUNT AND IT'S  EXACTLY WHAT WE ELECTED. IT'S DONALD TRUMP.  >> Reporter: THERE YOU GO,  LESTER. A LOT OF PEOPLE VERY PLEASED  WHAT THEY HEARD FROM DONALD  TRUMP TODAY.  >> YOU ARE IN NAPLES, FLORIDA. I APOLOGIZE. HERE IS THE BIDEN'S, DR. JOE  BIDEN AND FORMER VICE PRESIDENT  BIDEN AND HIS WIFE DR. JILL  BIDEN. AS A SENATOR THAT IS HOW HE  WOULD COMMUTE BACK AND FORTH TO  DELAWARE AND THE WAY THEY ARE  GOING HOME.  >> CHRIS COONS WHO REPLACED JOE  BIDEN AND SITS IN HIS FORMER  SENATE SEAT THERE AND TOM  CARPENTER, THE OTHER FORMER  SENATOR. JILL BIDEN USED TO TAKE AMTRAK  QUITE A BIT. I HAD BEEN ON IT ONCE IN A WHILE WHEN SHE IS ON IT. >> YOU WANT TO SEE THE WHO  WITH'S WHO OF THE POLITICAL,  JUST RIDE THE TRAIN FROM TIME TO TIME. I HAVE SEEN SOME REMARKABLE  FOLKS ON BOARD.  >> IT'S EVERYBODY THAT DONALD  TRUMP WAS RUNNING AGAINST  INSIDE.  >> IT IS.  >> CORRIDOR.  >> A FAVORITE AMONG A LOT OF  FOLKS WHO COME BACK AND FORTH. YOU CAN FLY. YOU CAN FLY BUT DELAYS AND  TRAFFIC, IT SIMONS TAKES ABOUT  THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME.  >> ONE OF THE THINGS I WISH  DONALD TRUMP, THE NEW PRESIDENT, HAD TALKED ABOUT TODAY, AND WE  ARE GOING TO FIX THE TRACKS ON  AMTRAK.  >> HE BROUGHT UP THE RAILROAD. HE DID BRING UP THAT. I KNOW HE WANTS TO FIX  LaGUARDIA.  >> WE KNOW THAT HE WENT ON THE  BUSINESS CLASS DOOR, NOT THE  FIRST CLASS DOOR. MANY STAFF MEMBERS. WE TOLD ABOUT 1,800 PEOPLE AT  THE SENDOFF FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA  AND FORMER FIRST LADY. A LOT MORE COVERAGE. THIS DAY HAS HARDLY BEGUN ON  THIS INAUGURATION DAY AND OUR  NBC NEWS COVERAGE WILL CONTINU   >>> SO HELP ME GOD.  >> CONGRATULATIONS, MR.  PRESIDENT.  >> FROM THIS DAY FORWARD, IT'S  GOING TO BE ONLY AMERICA FIRST. >> NBC NEWS LIVE COVERAGE OF THE INAUGURATION OF DONALD TRUMP  CONTINUES. HERE IS LESTER HOLT. >> AMERICA HAS A NEW PRESIDENT. DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN SWORN IN  AS THE 45th PRESIDENT OF THE  UNITED STATES. HE DELIVERED A 16-MINUTE  STIRRING SPEECH, STICKING CLOSE  TO HIS VALUES THAT HE HAS TALKED ABOUT THOSE MANY MONTHS ON THE  CAMPAIGN TRAIL ABOUT AMERICA,  FIRST. YOU'RE LOOKING AT A LIVE PICTURE RIGHT NOW OF A VIP MARINE  HELICOPTER CARRYING FORMER  PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA AND  FORMER FIRST LADY MICHELLE  OBAMA. THEY WILL BE DES EMBARKING FROM  WE EXPECT TO HEAR FROM THEM FOR  A JET THAT TAKES THEM TO PALM  WE HEARD ABOUT 1,800 PEOPLE,  MOSTLY STAFFERS, ARE THERE. THE FORMER PRESIDENT HAS HAD A  NUMBER OF GOOD-BYES THE LAST  COUPLE OF WEEKS. ON HIS LAST FLIGHT OUT OF  ANDREWS ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE, A  LITTLE OVER A WEEK AGO, BEFORE  THE FLIGHT, HE SPENT TIME IN THE HANGAR WITHOUT THE CAMERAS AND  THANKING THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE  MAINTAINED AND KEPT AIR FORCE  ONE IN THE PRISTINE CONDITION  IT'S IN AND HE SPENT TIME WITH  THE MEMBERS OF THE HELICOPTER  CREW AS WELL. HE WILL PULL UP HERE SHORTLY AND WHEN WITH HE MAKES HIS REMARKS,  WE WILL CERTAINLY CARRY THEM. I'M HERE WITH TOM BROKAW AND  CHUCK TODD AND MICHAEL BESLOSS  JOINS US. HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK BARACK  OBAMA WILL HAVE IN THE FUTURE OF REBUILDING THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY? >> HE HAS SAID HE WANTS TO GO  READ AND WRITE SOME MORE. HE IS A SCHOLAR, AFTER ALL THAT  IS HOW HE CAME INTO POLITICS IN  THE FIRST PLACE. WHAT HE HAS BEEN SAYING IS I'M  GOING TO BE ALERT TO WHAT WE  NEED TO DO ABOUT HOW THE COUNTRY BEGINS TO CHANGE OR NOT CHANGE  AND I THINK THAT WILL DRIVE IT  MORE THAN HIM STEPPING UP AND  SAYING I'M HERE TO HELP.  >> I THINK HE IS, WITHOUT A  LEADER RIGHT NOW, THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, HE IS ESSENTIALLY THE  DEFAULT LEADER OF THE PARTY. >> RIGHT.  >> AND HE FILLS THAT VACUUM TO A POINT. THE QUESTION IS HOW OFTEN WILL  HE CHOOSE TO SPEAK OUT? I GO BACK TO, I THINK ACTUALLY  JOE BIDEN OF THE TWO OF THEM, WE WILL PROBABLY HEAR MORE FROM JOE BIDEN AND HE MAY CHANNEL WHAT  BARACK OBAMA MIGHT WANT TO SAY  BUT I DO THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA  IS MINDFUL AND APPRECIATIVE THAT PRESIDENT BUSH DIDN'T DO  CRITICISM BUT LEFT TO CHENEY  ALMOST AND --  >> BEFORE YOU RESPOND, I WANT TO LET FOLKS KNOW THE RIGHT SIDE OF YOUR SCREEN THERE, THE  PROCESSION ABOUT TO START INTO  STATUARY HALL FOR A LUNCHEON AND PRESIDENT TRUMP AND FIRST LADY  WILL BE ATTENDING.  >> PRESIDENT OBAMA GOES OUT ON A HIGH HIGH AND HAS GOOD NUMBERS  GOING OUT AND PEOPLE FEEL GOOD  ABOUT HIM AND GRACEFUL HOW THEY  HAVE BEEN TREATING THE INCOMING  PRESIDENT. ANYTHING YOU DO BACK IN THE  PUBLIC ARENA, AGAIN, RUNS A RISK OF TAKING THAT DOWN OR  DIMINISHING IT. YOU WANT TO CHERISH WHAT YOU'VE  GOT AND NOT RISK IT AT SOME  POINT. HE IS GOING TO BE VERY MINDFUL  OF THAT, I WOULD THINK.  >> YOU KNOW WHAT? HE IS MINDFUL THAT THE  DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS A MESS. HE HAS TAKEN RESPONSIBILITY FOR  IT AND I ACTUALLY THINK HE WANTS TO SPEND TIME DOING SOME THINGS  FOR THE PARTY THAT I THINK, IN  HINDSIGHT, HE REGRETS HE DIDN'T  DO AS PRESIDENT.  >> YOU CAN DO THAT WITH PAPERS  AND CONFERENCES WITH PEOPLE. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT YOU DON'T  HAVE TO PUT YOURSELF OUT THERE  AND SAY I'M GOING TO BE THE GUY  ON THE WHITE HORSE THAT REPAIR  ALL OF THIS. THAT IS A RISKY PROPOSITION.  >> ONE THING THAT IS DIFFERENT  IN THIS DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND MY  ENTIRE ADULT LIFETIME BASICALLY, THE CLINTON'S HAVE BEEN AMONG  THE LEADERSHIP OF THE PARTY AND  WE ARE NOW -- THIS IS NOW THE  CLINTON'S ARE IN THE PAST. THEY HAVE NO ROLE IN THIS PARTY  NOW. IT IS WHAT IS LEFT, BARACK  OBAMA.  >> HUGH HEWITT, AS WE WAIT TO  SEE THE FORMER PRESIDENT AND  FORMER FIRST LADY LEAVE, DO YOU  THINK MR. OBAMA WILL TAKE AN  OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND ALL TO  WHAT WE HEARD ON --  >> I AM SO CURIOUS. I DO BELIEVE HE WANTS TO ACTS AS EISENHOWER DID AS KENNEDY AS A  RESOURCE FOR A NEW PRESIDENT WHO MAY NOTnd THE COMPLEXITY OF THE  JOB OR ON THE OVERWHELMING PACE  OF THE INTERNATIONAL EVENTS. HE MAY WANT TO PRESERVE THE  OPPORTUNITY. SUBTLY? YES. THERE WAS QUITE AN INDICTMENT OF EVERYTHING IN THE PRESIDENT'S  16-MINUTE SPEECH TODAY, SUCH AN  INDICTMENT THAT SOME OF HIS MOST LOYAL PEOPLE WILL WANT HIM TO. THEY WILL BE MAKING EYE CONTACT  WITH HIM. WE WILL SEE IF HE RESIST.  >> THEY MAY BE UPSET AT HIM IF  HE DOESN'T. SOME IN THE DEMOCRATIC BASE, YOU KNOW, THEY ARE UPSET THAT  PRESIDENT OBAMA DIDN'T, YOU  KNOW, TALK MORE ABOUT RUSSIA  BEFORE THE CAMPAIGN, THINGS LIKE THAT. SO THAT IS, I THINK YOU'RE  RIGHT. I THINK THERE IS A TENSION THERE AND I THINK HE'S GOT TO GIVE  THEM SOMETHING.  >> HERE ARE THE OBAMA'S.  >> THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS  THAT ALL OF THE ATTENTION IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE IS GOING TO  BE ON THE NEW PRESIDENT AND WHAT HE DOES IN THE OVAL OFFICE AND  HOW HE INTERACTS WITH CONGRESS  AND INTERACTS WITH THE AMERICAN  PUBLIC AND USING THE BULLY  PULPIT THAT HE NOW HAS.  >> LET ME GO TO KELLY O'DONNELL  WHO IS GETTING MORE  CONGRESSIONAL REACTION WHAT WE  HAVE SEEN. >> I'M HERE WITH A DEMOCRAT OF  MICHIGAN WHO IS ALSO PART OF THE LEADERSHIP TEAM. DEBBIE, YOU HEARD THE NEW  PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. DO YOU FEEL THAT IT DOES  ANYTHING TO UNIFY YOUR STATE? OF COURSE, HAD A LOT OF SUPPORT  FOR DONALD TRUMP. YOU ARE A DEMOCRAT. WHERE DO THINGS STAND NOW HE IS  PRESIDENT? >> CERTAINLY I'M GOING TO WORK  WITH HIM ON THE THINGS THAT I  FEEL GOOD FROM MICHIGAN AND  MICHIGAN WORKERS. I WAS SURPRISED AT HOW DARK HIS  COMMENTS WERE TODAY. IT FELT DEPRESSING AND DARK WHEN I WAS HOPING AS OTHER PRESIDENTS HE WOULD BE MORE HOPEFUL AND  INSPIRING. EVEN TWICE SUCH IMPORTANT  WONDERFUL THINGS HAPPENING AND  PEOPLE WORKING VERY HARD AND  BUSINESSES WORKING VERY HARD AND JOBS COMING BACK. THINGS ARE HAPPENING. YET, ONCE AGAIN, HE DESCRIBED IT AS A HORRIBLE PLACE. >> Reporter: YOU WOULD HOPE FOR  SOMETHING DIFFERENT? >> I WOULD HAVE HOPED FOR  SOMETHING DIFFERENT.  >> Reporter: I KNOW YOU HAVE TO  GET INTO THE LUNCH SO WE THANK  YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND LOOK  FORWARD TO HEARING HOW YOU  RESPOND AND WORK WITH HIM IN THE MONTHS TO COME. THANK YOU SO MUCH.  >> THANK YOU.  >> LESTER, BACK TO YOU.  >> KELLY, THANKS. KEVIN TIBBLES IS IN OHIO AND  TRYING TO GET MORE REACTION AS  WE SWEEP AROUND THE COUNTRY TO  THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH. KEVIN? >> I AM IN PEMBERHILL, OHIO. THIS IS A TOWN VOTED FOR HOW  MANY PRESIDENTS? >> 24.  >> OF THE LAST? >> 30. IS THAT RIGHT IN YOU VOTED FOR  ON DONALD J. TRUMP THIS TIME  AROUND. BOB, WHAT DID YOU HEAR HIM TO  SAY AND DID YOU HEAR IT? >> I WANTED TO HAPPIER THE UNITY THING IS A HUGE THING. I THINK THE COUNTRY HAS GOT TO  COME TOGETHER, WHETHER YOU LIKE  HIM OR NOT. YOU BETTER HOPE HE IS  SUCCESSFUL. I'M NOT SURE YOU WOULD NOT WANT  HIM TO BE SUCCESSFUL.  >> BOB RUNS THE LOCAL GROCERY  STORE AND BUTCHER SHOP AND CAROL REPAIRS PIANO. YOU ARE A REPUBLICAN AND YOU  VOTED REPUBLICAN.  >> I AM.  >> Reporter: MY QUESTION HE  SPOKE ABOUT LISTEN TO GO MIDDLE  AMERICA. WE ARE IN MIDDLE AMERICA. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT? I THINK HE IS LISTENING TO THE  COLLECTIVE VOICE OF MIDDLE  AMERICA AND HE HEARS JOBS AND WE WANT OBAMACARE DEALT BACK. I THINK HE IS LISTENING AND  HEARS FROM PEOPLE.  >> LAURA IS NEXT AND IN THE  MINORITY BECAUSE SHE IS A  DEMOCRAT.  >> YOU'RE THE TOWN'S DEMOCRAT.  >> THERE'S A COUPLE.  >> Reporter: WHAT WERE YOU  LOOKING TO HEAR TODAY? OBVIOUSLY, YOUR CANDIDATE WAS  NOT SUCCESSFUL. ARE YOU LOOKING TO PERHAPS HEAL  SOME OF THE WOUNDS? >> I THINK SO. I REALLY WANT OUR PRESIDENT TO  BUILD ON THE STRENGTH OF OUR  COUNTRY I WANT HIM TO RECOGNIZE  AND RESPECT EVERYONE.  >> Reporter: EVERYONE? >> EVERYONE.  >> Reporter: THAT THE VOICE FROM PEMBER HILL, OHIO. THEY VOTED FOR DONALD J. TRUMP,  OUR NEW PRESIDENT. I SEND IT BACK TO YOU FROM THE  OPERA HOUSE.  >> KEVIN, THANK YOU AND TO THE  FOLKS STICKING AROUND AND  TALKING TO US. LET'S GO BACK TO THE CAPITOL. KELLY O'DONNELL HAS ANOTHER  GUEST FOR US.  >> WE ARE HERE WITH ROB PORTMAN  OF OHIO. HE WAS RE-ELECTED IN THE SAME  ENVIRONMENT THAT DONALD TRUMP  WON OHIO. WHEN YOU HEAR THE NEW PRESIDENT  SPEAKING TODAY, DO YOU THINK HE  IS SETTING A TONE HE WILL REACH  OUT TO THOSE AMERICANS WHO DID  NOT VOTE FOR HIM? >> ABSOLUTELY. HE TALKED ABOUT UNITY AND THE  FACT WE, AS AMERICANS, ARE  STRONGER AND WE ARE UNIFIED. I LIKED HIS COMMENTS ABOUT  PATRIOTISM. YOU LOOK OUT FOR EVERYONE. IT'S INTERESTING HOW HE REACHES  OUT NOT JUST TO REPUBLICANS AND  DEMOCRATS AND HOW HE REACHES OUT TO CONGRESS AND THEY REACH BACK  TO HIM TO WORK TOGETHER. WE HAVE BIG PROBLEMS TO TACKLE  AND I HOPE THAT, YOU KNOW, THIS  IS THE START OF A NEW  RELATIONSHIP WHERE WE CAN  ACTUALLY GET THINGS DONE LIKE  TAX REFORM AND GETTING THE  ECONOMY MOVING. STRENGTHENING OUR MILITARY WHICH HE TALKED ABOUT TODAY.  >> NOW THAT THE JOB IS HIS, IS  THERE SOMETHING YOU'D LIKE TO  SEE HIM DO DIFFERENTLY? RELATIONSHIP WISE? HOW SHOULD HE CHANGE, IF AT ALL, RIGHT NOW? >> HE CONTINUES TO REACH OUT. THE IS PRESIDENT OF OF ALL  AMERICANS AND THIS IS NO LONGER  THE CAMPAIGN. I THINK HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT AND IN HIS COMMENTS TODAY WHEN HE  TALKED ABOUT UNITY, I THINK, YOU KNOW, THAT IS THE STEP IN THE  RIGHT DIRECTION.  >> Reporter: THANK YOU, SENATOR. APPRECIATE YOUR TIME, SENATOR  ROB PORTMAN OF OHIO.  >> ALL RIGHT, KELLY. THIS IS BEING COVERED AND  WATCHED ALL OVER THE WORLD. CERTAINLY HIGH INTERESTS IN  RUSSIA WHICH HAS BECOME A KEY  ISSUE. CERTAINLY IN THIS -- DURING THIS TRANSITION. WE WANT TO GO TO RICHARD ENGEL  WHO IS IN RED SQUARE. ARE THEY COVERING THIS  WALL-TO-WALL ON TELEVISION  THERE? WHAT IS THE LEVEL OF COVERAGE,  RICHARD? >> A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WATCHING  THIS. IN FACT, ABOUT TRUMP MANIA IN  THIS COUNTRY. THERE ARE VIEWING PARTIES. THERE ARE TRUMP BAND. THERE IS ONE TOWN OUTSIDE OF  MOSCOW WHERE THEY HAVE A BRANDED TRUMP SUGAR. PEOPLE ARE VERY EXCITED THAT  TRUMP COULD RESET RELATIONS WITH WASHINGTON, WITH MOSCOW. VLADIMIR PUTIN, HOWEVER,  REPORTEDLY IS NOT WATCHING THE  CEREMONIES LIVE ACCORDING TO HIS OFFICIAL SPOKESMAN. THE CEREMONY WAS TOO LONG AND  THAT HE WOULD CATCH UP ON IT ON  THE NEWS. IN GENERAL IN THIS COUNTRY A  TREMENDOUS INTP. WHEN YOU LOOK ACROSS THE WORLD,  HOWEVER, THERE IS A LOT OF  TREPIDATION. NOT EVERYONE IS AS EXCITED AS  RUSSIA IS. IN EUROPE THEY ARE WATCHING THIS AS A GENERAL RISE OF POPULISM, A SYMPTOM OF ANGER THAT THEY ARE  FEELING WITHIN THE EUROPEAN  UNION. IN THE MIDDLE EAST, FRANKLY, A  LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF DONALD TRUMP. THEY HEAR HIS COMMENTS ABOUT --  THAT HE MADE DURING THE CAMPAIGN ABOUT BANNING MUSLIMS. THEY HEAR THE KIND OF  PROTECTIONIST THEY MIGHT EVEN  SAY AUTHORITARIAN SPEECH THAT HE GAVE. THERE IS SOME COMMENTS IN LIBYA  WHERE THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT  HIS FIST PUMPING AND SAID IT  LOOKS LIKE MOAMMAR GADHAFI. I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE  OF RUSSIA ARE TRYING TO TAKE A  MEASURE OF THE MAN.  >> RICHARD ENGEL, THANK YOU SO  MUCH. WE WERE WATCHING ON THE OTHER  SIDE OF THE SCREEN THERE BRIEFLY FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA AND  MICHELLE OBAMA. THE NATIONAL ANTHEM IS PLAYED  THERE. THIS IS AT JOINT BASE ANDREWS. LET'S WATCH. ♪♪ ♪♪ >>> THE FORMER PRESIDENT JOINING A VERY EXCLUSIVE AND SMALL CLUB  OF FORMER PRESIDENTS. WE EXPECT HIM TO MAKE REMARKS  HERE IN A MOMENT BEFORE HE AND  HIS FAMILY DEPART TO VACATION IN PALM SPRINGS, CALIFORNIA. THIS IS A VIEW ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE CAPITOL. RUDY GIULIANI, THE FORMER NEW  YORK MAYOR, IS THERE IN STATUARY HALL WHERE A LUNCHEON IS HONORED FOR THE NEW PRESIDENT IN A  MATTER OF MOMENTS.  >> YOU ARE SEEING THE  ESTABLISHMENT OF THE OLD  PRESIDENT AND NEW PRESIDENT IN  THAT SPLIT SCREEN.  >> HERE IS BARACK OBAMA.  >> HELLO, EVERYBODY! YOU KNOW, MICHELLE AND I, WE  HAVE REALLY BEEN MILKING THIS  GOOD-BYE THING, SO IT BEHOOVES  ME TO BE VERY BRIEF. YEAH. YES. YOU KNOW, I SAID BEFORE AND I  WILL SAY AGAIN THAT WHEN WE  STARTED ON THIS JOURNEY, WE DID  SO WITH AN ABIDING FAITH IN THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THEIR  ABILITY, OUR ABILITY TO JOIN  TOGETHER AND CHANGE THE COUNTRY  IN WAYS THAT WOULD MAKE LIFE  BETTER FOR OUR KIDS AND OUR  GRANDKIDS. THE CHANGE DIDN'T HAPPEN FROM  THE TOP DOWN, BUT IT HAPPENED  FROM THE BOTTOM UP. IT WAS MET SOMETIMES WITH  SKEPTICISM AND DOUBT. SOME FOLKS DIDN'T THINK WE COULD PULL IT OFF. THERE WERE THOSE WHO FELT THAT  THE INSTITUTIONS OF POWER  PRIVILEGE IN THIS COUNTRY WERE  TOO DEEPLY ENTRENCHED. AND, YET, ALL OF YOU CAME  TOGETHER IN SMALL TON AND BIG  CITIES, A WHOLE BUNCH OF YOU --  >> REMARKABLE SPLIT SCREEN  MOMENT. FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA SPEAKING  ON THE LEFT AND PRESIDENT TRUMP  TO SIGN SOME ORDERS BEFORE  ATTENDING A LUNCH OP.  >> WHO DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO  PRONOUNCE BARACK OBAMA. WE GOT TO KNOW EACH OTHER AND WE WENT INTO COMMUNITIES THAT MAYBE YOU HAD NEVER EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT VISITING AND MET PEOPLE ON THE  SURFACE SEEMED COMPLETELY  INDIFFERENT TO YOU. DIDN'T LOOK LIKE YOU OR TALK  LIKE YOU OR WATCH THE SAME TV  PROGRAMS AS YOU. YET, WHEN YOU STARTED TALKING TO THEM, IT TURNED OUT YOU HAD  SOMETHING IN COMMON. IN A GROUP. PEOPLE TOOK NOTICE. AND THROUGHOUT, IT WAS  INFUSED --  >> AS SOON AS THE SIGNING BEGINS WE WILL TAKE YOU FULL INTO THE  ROOM THERE BEFORE PRESIDENT  TRUMP IS ABOUT TO PUT HIS FIRST  ORDER OF BUSINESS. >> WILLFUL IGNORANCE TO ALL OF  THE CHALLENGES THAT AMERICA  FACES. IT WAS HOPE IN THE FACE OF  DIFFICULTY. HOPE IN THE FACE OF UNCERTAINTY. YOU PROVED -- AND THROUGHOUT  THIS PROCESS, MICHELLE AND I, WE JUST BEEN YOUR FRONT MEN. WE HAVE BEEN THE FACE, SOMETIMES THE VOICE --  >> LET'S LISTEN IN NOW.  >> ON FRONT ON THE TV SCREEN OR  IN FRONT OF THE MICROPHONE. >> LET'S LISTEN IN NOW TO  PRESIDENT TRUMP.  >> YOU HAVE TO SIGN THAT.  >> I KNOW THAT. I THOUGHT IT WAS HEALTH CARE WE  ERR SIGNING.  >> THAT'S NEXT. >> JUST SIGN.  >> JUST UNDERNEATH THAT.  >> ANYPLACE YOU WANT. >> HERE ARE A COUPLE OF PENS.  >> GOOD. GOOD. VERY GOOD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> YOU HAVE MORE TO SIGN.  >> A POPULAR DECISION BY  EVERYBODY. THAT'S GREAT. >> THAT IS IT? GENERAL MATTIS IS UP FIRST. THAT'S GREAT. THIS IS FOR REX. I ASSUME HE WAS APPROVED TODAY? >> IT'S COMING, THOUGH, RIGHT? >> IT LOOKS LIKE YOU ADDED SOME  LETTERS IN YOUR NAME.  >> WE BELIEVE WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS SIGNING NOW ARE REALLY THE  OFFICIAL NOMINATIONS FOR HIS  CABINET PICK. THESE ARE HIS FIRST EXECUTIVE  ACTIONS. >> WE KNOW FOR SURE TWO CABINET  SECRETARIES ARE CONFIRMED TODAY. THE REAL QUESTION MARK IS MIKE  POMPEO OF THE CIA. THERE WAS SOME HOPE BY THE  REPUBLICANS AND TRUMP TRANSITION HE COULD ALSO GET CONFIRMED  TODAY. TO OUR UNDERSTANDING, AT LEAST  ONE DEMOCRATIC SENATOR IS  HOLDING THAT UP. JON CORNYN IN THE SENATE WANTS  TO KEEP THE SENATE UP WORKING  THROUGH PAST MIDNIGHT TO GET  POMPEO CONFIRMED BUT THAT  DOESN'T SEEM LIKELY BUT WE WILL  SEE. BELIEVE IT OR NOT THERE ARE  STILL SOME NEGOTIATIONS ON THAT  BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP STAND TO GO TO THE CIA TOMORROW HAVING MIKE  POMPEO CONFIRMED TODAY WOULD  MAKE THAT VISIT A LITTLE LESS  AWKWARD.  >> THIS PICTURES REMIND US THE  PRESIDENT IS A GRANDFATHER. I BELIEVE THOSE ARE HIS  GRANDCHILDREN. WE WILL HAVE TO CHECK ON THAT.  THAT IS IVANKA TRUMP'S DAUGHTER THERE YOU SEE TO THE RIGHT OF  THE PRESIDENT, ARABELLA. SHE SEEMS TO BE THE KEEPER OF  THE PENS.  >> A LONG TRADITION IN  WASHINGTON.  >> HOW ABOUT WE DO NANCY FIRST? >> LOOKS LIKE THE COMING DAYS HE IS PUTTING HIS PEN TO PAPER ON  SOME DOCUMENTS THAT ARE GOING TO ERASE PART OF THE -- OR MUCH OF  THE OBAMA LEGACY.  >> I THINK THAT -- LOOK. WE KNOW HE IS GOING TO DO A  BUNCH OF EXECUTIVE ORDER AND  MOST OF THEM MONDAY. THE ONES THAT ARE VERY POLICY  ORIENTED. MAYBE ONE OR TWO TODAY BUT MOST  OF THEM ON MONDAY. IT'S THE IMMIGRATION ONES THAT  ACTUALLY WE STILL DON'T KNOW FOR SURE. EITHER LOOKING FOR WAYS PERHAPS  TO EVEN START BUILDING THE WALL  WITH AN EXECUTIVE ACTION. MAYBE THEY CAN REAPPROPRIATE  MONEY AND THEY ARE LOOKING INTO  THAT. BUT WHAT ORDER DOES HE SIGN AND  HOW QUICKLY THE DOCU ORDER IS A  BILL SPONSORED BY SOME  REPUBLICANS, THE SO-CALLED  DREAMERS. THOSE THAT WERE BROUGHT OVER  INTO THIS COUNTRY AS CHILDREN BY THEIR PARENTS THAT WERE  UNDOCUMENTED AND THEY WERE  UNDOCUMENTED. WE WILL SEE. DOES HE RESCIND IT IMMEDIATELY  OR WAIT FOR CONGRESS TO PASS A  DREAMER BILL? >> LET'S LISTEN TO SOME OF THIS  DIALOGUE GOING ON. >> TOM IS NOT --  >> NO, NO. MR. PRESIDENT, MR. PRESIDENT,  THE LEADER WANTS YOU TO SIGN  THAT.  >> YOU WANT THE LEADER TO GET  IT? >> YOU GOT A QUESTION? >> I'LL TAKE THEM. PUT THEM BACK. >> YOU DID VERY WELL YESTERDAY. RICK PERRY. OKAY. WHO WOULD LIKE THIS ONE? >> I WOULD.  >> GOOD. >> A TOUGH GROUP OF PEOPLE WE  HAVE. YOU GOT THAT READY FOR ME? THEY ARE LEARNING THE HARD WAY.  >> THE EASY WAY.  >> BETSY, HELP ME. EDUCATION, RIGHT? >> I THINK CHUCK WANTED IT.  >> NOT THAT ONE. NO, THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. >> WE GOT A ROUGH GROUP.  >> IT IS. >> I'M HAPPY FOR THAT. >> NEXT. I THINK WE ARE GOING TO NEED  SOME MORE PENS. LABOR. >> KELLY. >> COME ON. HE IS GOING TO DO A GOOD JOB. >> THIS IS A PERSON WHO HAS  GOTTEN GREAT REVIEWS. NOT WELL KNOWN. THIS IS THE VETERANS  ADMINISTRATION.  >> I THINK CHUCK MIGHT LIKE  THAT.  >> I'LL LET YOU DO THAT ONE. >> THANK YOU. GOOD PEN. >> THIS IS WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE WANTED JIM KELLY. HE'S A GOOD MAN.  >> CHUCK, YOU'RE GOING TO PUT  THE CAP ON THERE OR GET YOUR  SHIRT STAINED. >> HAMMER THE NAIL.  >> JOHN KELLY. >> REINCE SHOULD GET SOMETHING. >> ARE YOU GETTING SOME MORE  PENS BACK THERE? WHO? >> IT'S AN EQUAL NUMBERS.  >> I THINK DAN SHOULD GET THAT  ONE. RIGHT? :WHAT YOU'RE WATCHING HERE IS  PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNING SOME OF  THE OFFICIAL THINGS HE HAS TO  SIGN TO MOVE AHEAD WITH HIS  CABINET, SIGNING THE OFFICIAL  NOMINATIONS, WE BELIEVE, OF HIS  CABINET PICKS, AND AS THESE  THINGS GO IN WASHINGTON, THE PEN IS VERY IMPORTANT. YOU SEE A WHOLE ROW OF THEM AS  HE SIGNS, HE WILL PASS THE PENS  OUT TO VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THE  CONGRESS AND OTHER FOLKS WHO ARE GATHERED THERE. AND HE'S GOT ABLE AND READY  GRANDKIDS HELPING HIM WITH THAT  PROCESS. HE SEEMS TO BE CLEARLY ENJOYING  THIS MOMENT HERE. >> BASEBALL CARDS.  >> CARSON FOR KELLY. >> JUST LIKE A DOUBLE. >> SCOTT IS GOING TO DO A GREAT  JOB.  >> ABSOLUTELY.  >> SPEAKER WOULD LIKE THAT. >> BY THE WAY, SOMEWHERE IN THIS PROCESS TODAY, THE NEW PRESIDENT HAS FOUND TIME TO TWEET ON HIS  PERSONAL ADDRESS. ONE SAYS TODAY WE ARE NOT MERELY TRANSFERRING POWER FROM ONE  ADMINISTRATION TO ANOTHER OR ONE PARTY TO ANOTHER BUT WE ARE  TRANSFERRING POWER FROM D.C. AND GIVING IT BACK TO YOU. PRETTY MUCH ECHOING WHAT WE  HEARD IN HIS SPEECH. IF THERE WAS ANY DOUBT WHETHER  HE WOULD CONTINUE TWEETING, I  DOUBT IT HAS BEEN PUT TO REST.  >> IN THE REST OF PRESIDENT  OBAMA'S SPEECH, IT'S HARD TO  CLASSIFY AS ANY SORT OF  RESPONSE. HE DIDN'T DO THAT.  >> YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE  REMARKS HE MADE AT THE HANGAR? >> WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING THIS  AND WENT AWAY FROM IT. IN CASE FOLKS WERE WONDERING  WHAT ED. MORE THANKS TO THE STAFF, THINGS LIKE THAT. BUT HE DID NOT -- THERE WAS NO  DIRECT RESPONSE.  >> AFTER HE FINISHES THIS, WE  BELIEVE HE'LL GO ON INTO THE  STATUARY HALL FOR THE OFFICIAL  LUNCHEON. WE ARE, WE HAVE GOT A PARADE  THAT IS FOLLOWING A LIT LATER  ON. INAUGURAL PARADE. A LOT OF THE FOLKS YOU SAW IN  THE MALL WILL NOW BE LINING THAT ROUTE ALONG PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE  AND CLAIMING THEIR SPACE TO  WATCH THAT PARTICULAR CHAPTER IN THIS DAY IN HISTORY. >> I THINK MICKEY IS GOING TO DO A GOOD JOB. >> THERE YOU GO. THERE ARE SOME OF THE FOLKS  THERE ALIGNED ALONG THE PARADE  ROUTE AND PLENTY OF POLICE AS  YOU CAN SEE KEEPING THEM  COMPANY. >> WE ARE RUNNING OUT OF PEOPLE  TO GIVE THESE TWO. TO NIKKI HALEY? WE WANT A SECOND ONE? I'LL SIGN IT. GOVERNOR. CHINA LOVES HIM AND HE LOVES  CHINA. >> HERE IS ANOTHER ONE. YOU MUST KNOW? >> NEVER.  >> DAVID IS GOING TO DO A GREAT  JOB. OKAY? THANK YOU. >> ONE MORE. >> ONE MORE? >> ONE MORE. >> PROCLAMATION. >> PATRIOTISM PROCLAMATION. >> I THINK WE ARE DONE. >> YEA! >> APPLAUSE ALL AROUND FOR  PRESIDENT TRUMP AS HE TAKES SOME OF HIS FIRST OFFICIAL AS  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  SIGNING A NUMBER OF DOCUMENTS  RELATED TO HIS CABINET PICKS. AND HE WILL NOW MAKE -- NOW MAKE HIS WAY INTO THE HALL FOR  TODAY'S LUNCHEON. ON THE LEFT SIDE OF YOUR SCREEN  IS THE PICTURE FROM JOINT BASE  ANDREWS, NOT TOO FAR AWAY, WHERE PRESIDENT -- FORMER PRESIDENT  OBAMA IS SAYING A FAREWELL TO  THE FOLKS, SOME OF THE STAFF  MEMBERS, AIR FORCE AND OTHER  MILITARY PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE  AND SOME OF THE STAFFERS. A NICE SENDOFF BEFORE THEY HEAD  OUT OF TOWN. WE NOTICE THIS IS A ROUND TRIP. THEY WILL MAKE WASHINGTON THEIR  RESIDENCY FOR APPROXIMATELY THE  NEXT YEAR. THERE IS THE AIRPLANE THEY WILL  BE FLYING ON. ONE THEY HAVE LOGGED TENS AND  HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MILES  ON BEFORE. IT WILL HAVE A DIFFERENT CALL  SIGN AND BE EXECUTIVE ONE, NOT  AIR FORCE ONE. SIMPLY BECAUSE HE IS NO LONGER  THE PRESIDENT. THAT WILL CARRY THEM ON THIS  VACATION. IT'S A TRADITION THAT OUTGOING  PRESIDENTS RIDE ON THE  PRESIDENTIAL JET FOR THEIR FINAL TRIP OUT OF THE NATION'S  CAPITAL. ON THE RIGHT THERE, THERE IS  PRESIDENT CLINTON IN THE  BACKGROUND AND HILLARY CLINTON  IN THE FOREGROUND THERE. THEY WILL BE ATTENDING A  LUNCHEON IN HONOR OF THE NEW  PRESIDENT.  >> FORMER PRE THERE.  GEORGE H.W. BUSH HAS BEEN  BREATHING WELL ON HIS OWN AND  COMFORTABLE WATCHING THE  INAUGURATION COVERAGE TOGETHER  WITH MRS. BUSH, NEIL, AND  DAUGHTER-IN-LAW MARIA. UP A THERE WHILE IS STILL  REMAINING IN ICU AND OBSERVATION THERE.  >> WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE  WATCHING US BUT IF THEY ARE, WE  SEND OUR WELL WISHES FOR A  SPEEDY RECOVERY. RUDY GIULIANI.  >> ROSA DELORA NEXT TO HER. A CONGRESSMAN FROM CONNECTICUT.  >> GIULIANI WE WATCHED HIM  DURING THE TRANSITION WHO SEEMED TO BE A SHOO-IN FOR A PROMINENT  POST, BUT SOMEWHERE ALONG THE  LINE, THINGS WENT DOWN.  >> WILBUR ROSS, THE NEW COMMERCE SECRETARY THERE. RICK PERRY.  >> GOVERNOR PERRY.  >> ENERGY. >> RICK PERRY, WHO WENT FROM  TRYING TO GET RID OF THE ENERGY  DEPARTMENT TO HEADING THE ENERGY DEPARTMENT. NOT YET BUT WE WILL SEE. YEAH. MOST LIKELY. HE HAS NOT BEEN CONFIRMED.  >> IF HE GETS CONFIRMED. >> A COUPLE OF MORE. PRESIDENT CARTER IN THE  BACKGROUND THERE. >> WE KEEP NOTING HOW REMARKABLY GOOD HE LOOKS AND WHAT WITH A  GREAT STORY HE HAS TO TELL ABOUT HIS BATTLE WITH CANCER.  >> REX TILLERSON AND CHIEF  JUSTICE ROBERTS SHARING A TABLE  THERE. >> INAUGURATIONS MAKE FOR SOME  INTERESTING PAIRINGS AND GROUPS  SOMETIMES AT LEAST.  >> LIKE I SAID THE NEW  ESTABLISHMENT IS ESTABLISHING  THEMSELVES HERE A LITTLE BIT. PUTTING IN THEIR ROOTS. >> THE HARD WORK BEGINS RIGHT  AWAY. WE KNOW THAT THE PRESIDENT IS -- DAN QUAYLE THERE, A FORMER VICE  PRESIDENT. THE PRESIDENT IS EXPECTED TO  MAKE A TRIP OUT TO THE CIA OVER  THE WEEKEND AND BEGIN TRYING TO  MEND FENCES WITH THE  INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY THAT HAVE BEEN DAMAGED REGARDING SOME OF  THE RUSSIAN ALLEGATIONS.  >> IF MIKE POMPEO IS NOT  CONFIRMED TONIGHT, IT'S MY  UNDERSTANDING AND TALKING TO  JEREMY BASH WHO IS A CONTRIBUTOR TO US NOW AND USED TO WORK OVER  AT THE CIA, THE NUMBER THREE  PERSON, A CAREERIST, WHO WOULD  BE ACTING DIRECTOR AND WHO WOULD BE TAKING --  >> JOSH EARNEST, THE PRESS  SECRETARY FOR THE FORMER  PRESIDENT, GETTING A HUG. >> THAT IS HIS SON. ALREADY LOOKING LIKE A CIVILIAN. NO TIE. PROBABLY COULDN'T WAIT TO GET  RID OF THAT.  >> I WROTE INTO WASHINGTON WITH  BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON AND  TIPPER AND AL GORE WHEN THEY  CAME TO TAKE THEIR PLACE. WE ROAD IN AN RV. IT WAS A LITTLE UNSETTLING. I GOT OFF AT MEMORIAL BRIDGE. MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY NOW.  >> MACKING THEIR WAY TO THE  LUNCHEON AFTER THE SIGNING  CEREMONY. >> ANYHOW. I GOT OFF THE RV AND MEMORIAL  BRIDGE AND REALIZED THE  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  AND THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE  UNITED STATES ARE YOUNGER THAN I AM. >> THEY ARE ON THE LEFT.  >> CHIEF OF STAFFS.  >> VERY, VERY -- IT TOOK  PRESIDENT A WHILE TO FIND THAT  CHIEF OF STAFF THAT IS BASICALLY HIM.  >> BUT HE BONDED WITH THEM.  >> THEY REALLY DID. THIS IS DENNIS McDONOUGH COULD  CHANNEL PRESIDENT OBAMA IN WAYS  NO OTHER COULD. HE HAS GOOD RELATIONS WITH HIS  CHIEF OF STAFF AND DON'T GET ME  WRONG BUT DENNIS HAD A  CONNECTION WITH HIM.  >> HE WAS A FOOTBALL PLAYER.  >> A VIKINGS FAN.  >> IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THOSE OF  US TO POINT OUT WHO COVER THESE  WHITE HOUSES, YOU HAVE TO  UNDERSTAND HOW HARD ALL OF THESE FOLKS REALLY WORKED. SACRIFICE OF STAFF MEMBERS AND  CERTAINLY THE TRUMP FOLKS ARE  ABOUT TO FIND THAT ON OUT. VERY, VERY LONG HOURS. A REAL SENSE OF LOYALTY BETWEEN  A PRESIDENT AND STAFF AND WE  HAVE SEEN THAT CERTAINLY WITH  THIS OUTGOING WHITE HOUSE AND  I'M SURE WE WILL SEE IT IN THIS  NEW WHITE HOUSE.  >> ROBERT GIBBS ONCE SAID TO ME  THIS IS A FAMILY FRIENDLY WHITE  HOUSE FOR ONE FAMILY. THE FIRST FAMILY AND THAT'S HOW  IT WORKS.  >> REINCE PRIEBUS, THE NEW CHIEF OF STAFF. THERE IS ERIC TRUMP. TIFFANY TRUMP IN THE WHITE COAT. >> REINCE PRIEBUS, IN THE  POLITICAL WORLD, GETS HIGH  FIVE'S. HE HUNG IN THERE FOR A LONG  TIME. HE WAS THERE FOUR YEARS AGO. HE STUCK IN THERE THIS TIME. HE FOUND A WAY TO WORK WITH  TRUMP. HE KEPT THIS PARTY TOGETHER. THE PRESSURE HE WAS UNDER AT  TIMES TO DUMP TRP.  >> YEP.  >> AND HE WOULDN'T DO IT. HE STUCK BY. HE KEPT THE PARTY FROM TOTALLY  FRACTURING.  >> A FEW MINUTES AGO YOU WERE  WERE TALKING ABOUT THE DAMAGED  DEMOCRATIC PARTY BUT FOUR MONTHS AGO WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY WAS IN CRITICAL CONDITION.  >> THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S JUST DIFFERENT NOW. I'LL TELL YOU THIS, THERE IS A  DIFFERENT GROUP OF PEOPLE IN  CHARGE OF THIS PARTY NOW. IT IS A DIFFERENT MAKEUP OF THIS PARTY. I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW -- I  THINK WE THOUGHT IF HE LOSES  THERE IS A FIGHT BETWEEN THESE  TWO WINGS OF THE PARTY. THE TRUMP WING WON. THE TRUMP WING IS IN CHARGE. SO THAT IS AND IT'S SORT OF THE  QUESTION IS WHAT HAPPENS TO THE  BUSH REPUBLICANS? THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE  REPUBLICANS OTHERS MIGHT CALL  THEM? DO THEY FIND A WAY TO FIT IN? HOW DO THEY FIND A WAY TO FIT IN OR VICE VERSA. DOES TRUMP FIND WAYS TO BRING  THEM IN? >> THERE IS SPEAKER PAUL RYAN. AS WE ARE TALKING, I LOOK TO MY  LEFT AND LOOK WHO HAS DROPPED  BY? JACKIE WHO SANG THE NATIONAL  ANTHEM. TERRIFIC JOB. CONGRATULATIONS.  >> WELL DONE.  >> WHAT WAS IT LIKE? >> OH, IT WAS CRAZY. FREEZING COLD. BUT IT WAS AMAZING. IT WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE. >> YOU SANG WARMLY. YOU WARMED US UP.  >> THANK YOU SO MUCH! >> THAT IS A VERY HARD -- I'M  SORRY. I'M NOT A SINGER BUT I KNOW FROM ALL OF THE SINGERS, VERY HARD  ONE TO HIT, THE NOTES.  >> IT IS, BUT IT'S MAINLY JUST  BECAUSE OF THE PRESSURE OF THE  SONG, ITSELF, NOT THE NOTES. IT'S A BIG SONG. YOU DON'T WANT TO MESS IT UP.  >> I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN HEAR  IT.  >> THERE YOU ARE. >> JUST A WONDERFUL MOMENT.  >> THANK YOU. ♪ WHOSE BROAD STRIPES AND BRIGHT STARS THROUGH THE PERILOUS FIGHT ♪ ♪ O'ER THE RAMPARTS WE WATCHED WERE SO GALLANTLY STREAMING? ♪ >> I THINK SO. THEY TOLD ME THAT. ♪ AND THE ROCKETS' RED GLARE THE BOMBS BURSTING IN AIR ♪ ♪ GAVE PROOF THROUGH THE NIGHT THAT OUR FLAG WAS STILL THERE ♪ >> I HAVE CAN I SEE WHO WANT TO  BE INSTRUMENTALISTS.

WHAT WAS THE MOMENT? ♪ O'ER THE LAND OF THE FREE ♪ ♪ AND THE HOME OF THE BRAVE? ♪♪ >> WHEN MY VOICE CHANGED, IS  WHEN I WAS 6.  >> THAT IS WHAT IS WRONG WITH MY SINGING! >> ACROSS AMERICA, PARENTS ARE  GOING LET'S GET RID OF THE TON  SILLS OUT OF OUR KIDS! >> THANK YOU, JACKIE, FOR  STOPPING BY.  >> THANK YOU.  >> I HOPE YOU GET TO WATCH IT  ALL IN A MORE COMFORTABLE  SETTING BUT YOU DID A TERRIFIC  JOB.  >> THANK YOU SO MUCH.  >> CONGRATULATIONS.  >> SOMEONE ELSE WHO HAS DONE A  TERRIFIC JOB IS HALLIE JACKSON  AND DECIDED TO BRING HER OUT OF  THE COLD AND INTO OUR STUDIO.  >> JACKIE, THANK YOU. I WAS ACROSS THE CAPITOL FROM  WHERE YOU WERE AND YOU DIDN'T  LOOK COLD.  >> I WAS FREEZING. YOU CAN'T LOOK NERVOUS AND COLD  WHEN YOU'RE PERFORMING THE  NATIONAL ANTHEM.  >> YOU DID A LOVELY JOB.  >> HERE IS THE FINAL FAREWELL  FOR THE OBAMA'S. THEY ARE WALKING PAST THE HONOR  GUARDS AND WE WILL SEE IF HE  SALUTES ONE MORE TIME. THAT IS AN AMERICAN JOURNEY. YOU THINK WHERE HE CAME FROM. HIS MOTHER WAS FROM KANSAS AND  SHE WAS RAISED IN CHICAGO IN A  WORKING CLASS FAMILY. HARVARD AND PRINCETON AND THEN  BECAME PRESIDENT AND FIRST LADY. AND LEAVE WITH A GREAT SENSE IN  THIS COUNTRY OF HOW WHAT GREAT  PARENTS THEY WERE AND STEWARDS  OF FAMILY VALUES.  >> YOU CAN HEAR THE CHEERS.  >> PLACE MAT. THINK ABOUT THE PLACE MAT  CHANGED FOREVER IN WAYS. IT SENT A MESSAGE TO ALL  AMERICANS. >> THE OBAMA ERA IS OVER AS HE  BOARDS THE AIR FORCE JET THAT  WILL CARRY THEM ON VACATION INTO THE NEXT CHAPTER OF THEIR LIVES, BARACK AND MICHELLE OBAMA. ON THE RYE THERE IS VICE  PRESIDENT PENCE AND KAREN PENCE  MAKING THEIR WAY INTO THE  LUNCHEON. IN A MOMENT WE WOULD EXPECT TO  SEE PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE  FIRST LADY. THERE THEY ARE.  >> YOU TALK ABOUT THIS BEING THE END OF THE OBAMA ERA IN  WASHINGTON AND IT'S THE START OF THE TRUMP ERA AND I THINK IT  MEANS A LOT FOR THE REPUBLICANS  WHO ARE IN THIS ROOM ON CAPITOL  HILL, WHAT THIS MEANS FOR A  REPUBLICAN PARTY FOR A LONG TIME WOULDN'T ACCEPT DONALD TRUMP AND MANY PARTS OF IT REFUSING TO. NOW NOT ONLY FORCE TO DO BUT  ALMOST EXCITED ABOUT THE  POSSIBILITY OF WHAT THEY CAN  ACCOMPLISH MOVING FORWARD. HIS SPEECH WAS VERY INTERESTING. SOME REVIEWS EVEN FROM ONE  MEMBER OF CONGRESS WHO I WAS  TEXTING BACK AND FORTH WITH  THINKING THAT IT WAS SO SIMILAR. WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR A CAMPAIGN SPEECH AND WONDERING IS THAT THE KIND OF RHETORIC WE SEE FROM HIM MOVING FORWARD OR WILL  HE TRY TO STRIKE THAT MORE  INSPIRATIONAL AND HOPEFUL TONE.  >> YOU HAD A PRETTY GOOD VIEW  THERE. WAS THERE MANY APPLAUSE LINES  THAT EVERYBODY JOINED IN ON OR  WAS IT PARTISAN? >> IT WAS PARTISAN. MY PRODUCER SAID WATCH PRESIDENT OBAMA RIGHT NOW, FORMER  PRESIDENT OBAMA AT THAT POINT  AND SEE WHEN HE CLAPS AND HE  DOES. WEREN'T MANY MOMENTS YOU SAW  THAT SORT OF ROUND APPLAUSE  TOGETHER. DURING THE OATH AS WE WATCH THIS HERE.  >> LET'S WATCH THE INTRODUCTION. ♪♪ THE PRESIDENT GREETING PRESIDENT CLINTON. >> HERE WE GO. IF YOU COULD READ LIPS HERE.  >> THE ONLY THING I COULD READ  IS THANK YOU AT THE END.  >> THANK YOU FOR COMING.  >> SEEMS TO BE A GOOD PLACE  WHERE HE REACHED OUT AND  EXTENDED HIS HAND TO HILLARY  CLINTON. TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE, THE FIRST TIME THEY HAVE EXCHANGED  PLEASANTRIES IN PERSON. THERE WAS THE PHONE CALL, OF  COURSE. >> WELCOME TO THIS LUNCH AND IF  EVERYBODY WILL BE SEATED. MR. PRESIDENT, SAY TWICE  OFFICIALLY, MR. VICE PRESIDENT,  HONORED GUEST, WELCOME TO THIS  INAUGURAL LUNCHEON. THE JOINT CONGRESSIONAL  COMMITTEE ON INAUGURAL  CEREMONIES ARE PLEASED TO HOST  THIS LUNCH SINCE 1953 WITH  PRESIDENT EISENHOWER. IN 1981, PRESIDENT REAGAN'S  FIRST INAUGURATION, THE LUNCH  TOOK ITS CURRENT FORM AND MOVED  TO THIS GRAND HALL, THE NATIONAL STAT UARY HALL WHICH SERVED  UNTIL 1857 AS THE CHAMBER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. THE STATUES THAT LINE THE WALLS  OF THIS ROOM ARE PLACED  THROUGHOUT THE CAPITAL AND THEY  RECOGNIZE IMPORTANT FIGURES IN  OUR NATIONAL HISTORY. THE COLLECTION AND SINCE THIS  LUNCH WAS HELD THE LAST TIME  IT'S HAD SEVERAL ADDITIONS. ROSA PARKS IS NOW IN STATUARY  HALL AND SHE IS SEATED, RATHER  THAN STANDING, AS SHE SHOULD BE. WHEN MISS PARKS DIED IN 2005,  ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE WHO HAD  NEVER HELD ANY PUBLIC OFFICE OR  SERVED IN THE MILITARY TO LAY  HER HONOR IN THE CAPITAL ROTUNDA AND SEVERAL OF US WERE THERE  THAT DAY. ANOTHER ADDITION, NORMAN BERGLAW THE LEADER OF THE GREEN  REVOLUTION ABOUT HIS GREAT  EFFORTS TO FEED THE PEOPLE, THE  DEMANDS AND FOOD PRODUCTION AND  HE WAS REALLY A LEADER IN THAT  AREA AND TALKING TO GOVERNOR  PERDUE LAST NIGHT ABOUT WHAT IS  GOING TO HAPPEN AS WORLD FOOD  DEMAND DOUBLES IN 35 OR 40 YEARS AND THE GREAT OPPORTUNITY WE  HAVE THERE. BARRY GOLDWATER, A REAL  INSPIRATION TO A GENERATION OF  CONSERVATIVES, WAS ADDED TO  STATUARY HALL THE LAST FEW YEARS AND THOMAS EDISON OF OHIO WHO  DISCOVERED MORE THAN 10,000 WAY  NOT TO MAKE A LIGHT BULB, UNTIL  HE DISCOVERED THE ONE WAY TO  MAKE THAT LIGHT BULB. THE PAINTING IN THE MIDDLE OF  THE ROOM IS FROM A GREAT  MISSOURI ARTIST, GEORGE CALEB  BINGHAM. HE DID THREE PAINTINGS SERIES  HERE. ONE WAS STUMP SPEAKING AND ONE  WAS THE COUNTY ELECTION. THIS ONE IS VERDICT OF THE  PEOPLE. IN THE 1850s WHEN THIS WAS  PAINTED, OFTEN, IT WAS SEVERAL  DAYS AFTER THE ELECTION BEFORE  THE RESULTS WERE ANNOUNCED. AND ALL KIND OF PEOPLE ARE IN  THIS PAINTING. PEOPLE FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE,  PEOPLE WHO ARE EXCITED, PEOPLE  WHO ARE CONFUSED, PEOPLE WHO  WONDER WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND  PEOPLE WONDERING WHAT IS GOING  TO HAPPEN ARE ALL THERE. ACTUALLY, HE PAINTED THIS  PAINTING ABOUT THE SAME TIME  THAT -- IN THIS VERY ROOM SOME  OF THE LEAST SUCCESSFUL DEBATES  IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY  WERE BEING HELD, AND, OF COURSE, THAT WE PAID THE PRICE FOR NOT  BEING ABLE TO FIND SOLUTIONS. ONE OF MY FAVORITE STATUES IN  THE BUILDING IS IN A ROOM THAT I HAVE HERE IN THE CAPITOL RIGHT  NOW. I HAD IT IN THE WHIP'S OFFICE  WHEN I WAS THE WHIP IN THE  HOUSE. AND IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITES  BECAUSE NOBODY KNOWS WHO IT IS. AND I DON'T MEAN NOBODY HERE CAN GUESS WHO IT IS. I MEAN, NOBODY KNOWS WHO IT IS  AND NOBODY HAS KNOWN WHO IT WAS  SINCE ABOUT 1930. COULDN'T HAVE BEEN IN THE  CAPITOL BUILDING MORE THAN A  HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE PEOPLE  BEGAN TO WONDER WHO IS THIS  PERSON? AND I THINK IT'S A GREAT  REMINDER THAT WHAT WE DO HERE IS A LOT MORE IMPORTANT THAN WHO WE ARE. SO WE HAVE WORK IN FRONT OF US. IT'S A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY. IT IS A GREAT DAY AND I'M ASKING BARRY BLACK OF THE CHAPLAIN OF  THE SENATE TO COME AND GIVE US  OUR OPENING PRAYER. >> LET US PRAY. ETERNAL LORD GOD, OUR REFUGE AND STRENGTH, WE PRAISE YOU THAT WE  HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR. WE CAN STAND FEARLESSLY DURING  THIS SEASON OF PEACEFUL  TRANSITION BECAUSE WE KNOW YOUR  PROVIDENCE WILL PREVAIL. LORD, WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THIS  INAUGURAL LUNCHEON AND FOR YOUR  PROVIDENCE THAT HAS BROUGHT  PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP TO  THIS MILESTONE MOMENT. YOU HAVE ADMONISHED US TO PRAY  FOR LEADERS AND GOVERNMENTS, SO  WE PRAY FOR OUR NEW PRESIDENT. LORD, CROWN HIS LABORS WITH  SUCCESS, LEADING HIM TO THE  DESTINATION YOU HAVE CHOSEN. SURROUND HIM, HIS FAMILY AND THE MEMBERS OF HIS CABINET, WITH THE SHIELD OF YOUR DIVINE PROTECTION AND FAVOR. MAY PRESIDENT TRUMP SEEK YOUR  WISDOM, JUSTICE, AND GRACE,  LEADING WITH YOUR STRENGTH WHICH REACHES OUT TO THOSE ON LIFE'S  MARGINS. THE LOST, LONELY, LAST, LEAST,  AND LEFT OUT. MAY HE REMEMBER THAT THOSE WHO  WOULD LEAVE A LEGACY OF  GREATNESS MUST STRIVE TO BECOME  SERVANTS OF ALL. LORD, INSPIRE OUR PRESIDENT TO  PERFORM HIS GOD APPOINTED DUTIES WITH SUCH REVERENCE FOR YOU,  THAT HIS TENURE WILL BE LIKE THE SUN SHINING FORTH ON A  CLOUDILESS MORNING, LIKE A  RAINBOW AFTER A STORM, AND LIKE  THE SINGING OF THE BIRDS AT  DAWN. BLESS OUR FOOD AND FELLOWSHIP. WE PRAY IN YOUR SOVEREIGN NAME. AMEN. . 3 TU NOMBRE, AMEN! >> THAT LUNCHEON IS ABOUT TO  BEGIN. YOU HEARD LUNCH SERVED. THEY ARE GOING TO TURN THE  CAMERAS OFF THERE SO WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BRING YOU ANYTHING  MORE IN THIS ROOM. WE HAVE STILL GOT A LOT OF THE  DAY AHEAD. THE INAUGURAL PARADE DOWN  PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE THAT WILL  CARRY THE NEW FIRST FAMILY TO  THE WHITE HOUSE. WE WILL BE HERE FOR ALL OF THE  COVERAGE OF THAT. AND WE WILL TALK MORE ABOUT THE  SPEECH AND ABOUT THE FUTURE OF  THIS FAMILY WHEN WE COME BACK  FROM THIS BREAK. THIS IS NBC NEWS COVERAGE OF THE INAUGURATION. This is the food system. But what if it didn't
have to be? .  >>> WE ASSEMBLE HERE TODAY AND  ISSUE A NEW DECREE THAT WILL BE  AND IN EVERY HALL OF POWER, FROM >> DEFINING LINE ARGUABLY IN  DONALD TRUMP'S INAUGURAL SPEECH. PRESIDENT TRUMP. WE ACTUALLY HAVE A WORD CLOUD OF THE ENTIRE SPEECH AND PUT IT UP  THERE. ONE WORD DOMINATES. AMERICA, AMERICAN, AMERICA  FIRST. THERE'S A HISTORY TO THAT  PHRASE.  >> THERE IS. IT'S CHECKERED IN A LOT OF WAYS. AND HE HAS REACTIVATED IT AND  THIS SPEECH WAS A SPEECH HOW HE  FIRST BEGAN WHEN HE FIRST CAME  DOWN THAT ESCALATOR AT TRUMP  TALKER. THIS IS HIS TEAM AND WHAT HE  WANTS TO DO TO ADVANCE THE  COUNTRY. WE DO LIVE IN A DIFFERENT WORLD  NOW, OBVIOUSLY. THERE IS GREAT CONCERN ABOUT  ISOLATION OF AMERICA FROM AN  ECONOMIC POINT OF VIEW, AS WELL  AS FROM A DEFENSE POINT OF VIEW. WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THE LEADER  OF THE WEST AND REACHED OUT TO  EUROPE AND OUR ALLIES, INCLUDING JAPAN, TO FIND OUR WAY. THERE IN THIS WHITE HOUSE NOW A  REALLY STRONG BELIEF THAT YOU'VE GOT TO ISOLATE AMERICA OUT AND  CONCENTRATE ON THE VALLEYS THAT  MAKE UP THIS COUNTRY AND WHO WE  ARE AND HOW WE ARE GOING TO GET  TO WHERE WE ARE GOING TO GO.  >> LET'S BRING IN QUICKLY,  DORIS. AMERICA FIRST, DORIS. THERE IS PRE-WORLD WAR II. A PHRASE THAT SENT A SIGNAL TO  MANY AMERICANS.  >> WITHOUT A QUESTION. IN THOSE DAYS 1939, 1940, 1941  THE AMERICA FIRST PEOPLE WERE  ARGUING FOR AMERICAN ISOLATION  AFTER THE EXPERIENCE OF WORLD  WAR I. IF THEY HAD NOT BEEN OVERDONE WE WOULD TAKE MAYBE LONGER TO GET  MOBILIZED FOR THE WAR EVEN  BEFORE PEARL HARBOR. GIVEN AFTER WORLD WAR II, WE  GAME THE BECAME THE WORLD LEADER IN PART BECAUSE WE HAD ALLIANCES AND THAT IS WHAT WE NEED AGAIN.  >> WE WANT TO GO ON THE STREETS  OF WASHINGTON NOW WHERE SOME OF  THE PROTESTS ARE GETTING A BIT  OUT OF HAND. JACOB, WHERE ARE YOU AND WHAT  CAN YOU TELL US? HELLO, JACOB? >> OH, MY. >> I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE. I CAN'T HEAR FROM JACOB. YOU CAN SEE WHAT APPEARS TO  BE -- WHAT APPEARS TO BE TEAR  GAS AND POLICE MOVING IN ON A  CROWD HERE. >> WE HAVE HAD REPORTS OF TEAR  GAS WAS USED.  >> THIS IS 12th.  >> GO, GO! >> 12th AND L IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE WASHINGTON, D.C. AREA. POLICE HAVE BEEN WANTING TO KEEP AWAY -- THAT SOUND LIKE TEAR GAS SHELLS TO ME. THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO  SEPARATE PROTESTERS ON EITHER  SIDE. THERE WERE SOME PROMISES OF  PROTESTERS TO SHUT DOWN SOME KEY INTERSECTIONS AND TRY TO BLOCK  ACCESS TO THE PARADE ROUTE BUT  SOMETHING HAS INSTIGATED THIS  AROUND THE AREA OF 12th AND L IN WASHINGTON, D.C. JACOB, CAN YOU HEAR ME? JACOB? OKAY. NO, WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HIM  YET BUT WE CONTINUE TO WATCH  THIS PLAY OUT. SEVERAL TEAR GAS -- WE GOT YOU. >> HOLD ON HOLD ON! >> LESTER, I APOLOGIZE FOR THE  AUDIO ISSUES. ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE POLICE  OFFICERS STARTED TO SPRAY PEPPER SPRAY AND THEY GOT OUR AUDIO  TECHNICIAN SO WE LOST THAT  AUDIO. WE WERE RUNNING BECAUSE THEY  WERE THROWING FLASH BANGS, VERY, VERY LOUD. AT THE SAME TIME THEY WERE  ARRESTING SOME PEOPLE. THE PROTESTERS IN THE SCENE  BEHIND US -- THEY HAVE BEEN HERE FOR HOURS. TALKING ABOUT A DOZEN GROUPS OR  MORE OF PROTESTERS THAT WERE  TRYING TO BLOCK CHECKPOINTS THIS MORNING AND THEN MAYBE A COUPLE  OF HOURS AGO, THEY STARTED TO  CONVERGE INTO ONE GROUP AND THEY STARTED TO SMASH WINDOWS THAT  THEY WERE RUNNING AROUND AND  THROW TABLES. THAT'S WHAT WITH WE SAW A FEW  HUNDRED POLICE OFFICERS COME UP  AND TRY TO CORNER THEM. THEY WERE RUNNING AROUND FOR  HALF AN HOUR OR SO. THEY FINALLY CORNERED A LOT OF  THEM AND STARTED MAKING ARRESTS. A COUPLE OF HOURS UNTIL JUST  NOW. THEY ARE THROWING MORE FLASH  BOMBS AND YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR  THEM AS THEY DO THIS. THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO CONTROL THE PROTESTERS FOR HOURS. AT THIS POINT, I WOULD GUESS  THAT THERE ARE NEAR A THOUSAND  PROTESTERS TOTAL. YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THINGS  FLYING BECAUSE THESE PROTESTERS  ARE THROWING BRICKS OR ROCKS OR  BOTTLES. YOU KNOW FROM THE D.C. POLICE  THAT AT LEAST THREE OF THEIR  OFFICERS WERE HURT EARLIER  TODAY. WE HAVE SEEN PROTESTERS INJURED  BECAUSE OF PEPPER STRIKES. I SHOULD CLARIFY MOST OF THE  PROTESTERS ARE NOT THROWING  THINGS. A SMALL GROUP OF MAY 50, 60 OF  THEM HAVE THEIR FACES COVERED  AND DRESSED IN BLACK. WE LOOK OVER HERE AND YOU'RE  GOING TO SEE THEM TRYING TO  CARRY A GATE. THEY ARE TRYING TO THROW THIS. WE HAVE MOVED BACK A LITTLE BIT, AGAIN, BECAUSE WE WERE BEING HIT BY THE PEPPER SPRAY. >> JACOB RASCONE, WE DIDN'T HEAR EVERYTHING YOU WERE SAYING BUT  SOME GROUPS ARE THROWING FLASH  BANG GRENADES AND PEPPER SPRAY  DISBURSED INTO THE AREA TO GET  PEOPLE TO MOVE BACK. I SEE YOU HAVE MOVED BACK, WHICH WE ARE GRATEFUL YOU'RE OKAY. WAS THIS A MOVING DEMONSTRATION, JACOB? OR WAS IT ALWAYS PLANNED FOR  THIS AREA? >> SO, LESTER, THIS MORNING,  THERE WERE A DOZEN OR MORE  SEPARATE GROUPS, AS I SAID  TRYING TO SHUT DOWN CHECKPOINTS. AT ABOUT 11:00 WE HAD A GROUP OF MAYBE 100 PROTESTERS MAINLY  DRESS INSIDE BLACK WITH THEIR  FACES COVERED. THEY WERE NOT JUST WALKING. THEY WERE RUNNING AROUND AND  TOSSING CHAIRS AND THROWING  TABLES. THEN THERE WAS A --  >> THEY ARE COMING DOWN. WE GOT TO MOVE! >> A HAMMER. THAT IS THE PROTESTERS AND THE  POLICE SURROUNDING THE LAST  COUPLE OF HOURS. MORE THAN A COUPLE OF HOURS, I  SHOULD SAY, WERE CHASING. AS THE PRESIDENT WAS TAKING THE  OATH OF OFFICE, THEY HAD THEM  SURROUNDED AND MOSTLY IT WAS  QUIET AND WE WERE STATIONARY IN  ONE INTERSECTION FOR A WHILE  UNTIL JUST NOW. UNTIL FIVE MINUTES AGO WHEN SOME OF THE PROTESTERS THAT APPEARED  TO BE PUSHING AGAINST THE POLICE LINE. POLICE STARTED TO PUSH BACK AND  THAT IS WHEN THEY STARTED TO  SPRAY MORE PEPPER SPRAY. YOU'RE GOING TO SEE NOW THE LINE OF POLICE OFFICERS. THEY ARE CLOSE ENOUGH TO US. YOU CAN SEE THEM. I WOULD SAY THAT -- THEY ARE  SHOOTING RIGHT NOW OUT OF WHAT  LOOKS LIKE PAINT BALL GUNS. LIKE A PEPPER SPRAY BALL THAT  THEY SPRAY AND IT HITS AND YOU  SMELL, YOUR EYES CAN FEEL IT AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO BREATHE. WE WERE SEEING THAT EARLIER.  >> JACOB, CAN YOU GIVE US SOME  SENSE AS TO HOW FAR THIS IS FROM THE PARADE ROUTE, FROM THE  CAPITOL? >> LESTER, 12th STREET AND L  STREET IS PROBABLY SEVEN OR  EIGHT BLOCKS AWAY FROM THE  PARADE ROUTE. YOU SEE SOMEBODY WITH A HAMMER  SMASHING THINGS. I APOLOGIZE FOR THE AUDIO ISSUES HERE. WE ARE PROBABLY ABOUT FIVE OR  SIX BLOCKS AWAY FROM THE PARADE  ROUTE AND THE INAUGURATION. >> THAT IS ACTUALLY A FAIRLY  LONG WAY. A LOT OF PERIMETER AND A LOT OF  SECURITY. THIS SHOULDN'T BE DISRUPTIVE TO  THE PARADE.  >> NO. THEY HAVE SHUT DOWN A LOT OF  STREETS CERTAINLY IN PREPARATION AND THEY HAVE PRACTICED FOR THIS KIND OF THING. IT IS STRIKING COUNTER TO THE  PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER WE  WITNESS A LITTLE OVER AN HOUR  AGO.  >> THE AUDIO IS JARRING ON THIS  DAY. IT'S JUST JARRING THAT IN THE  CAPITAL CITY OF THE UNITED  STATES OF AMERICA ON  INAUGURATION DAY, WE ARE HEARING THIS SOUND.  >> JACOB, HAVE YOU SEEN ANYONE  INJURED AT ALL? >> WE HAVE SEEN A COUPLE OF  OFFICERS BEING TREATED AND WE  HAVE SEEN A FEW PROTESTERS  CARRIED OUT BY OTHER PROTESTERS. EARLIER TODAY, AT LEAST ONE  PROTESTER THAT WAS BLEEDING FROM THE HEAD AND WAS CARRIED OFF IN  A STRETCHER. UP AND DOWN I STREET WHERE THE  PROTESTERS WERE RUNNING AROUND  EARLIER, WINDOWS WERE KNOCKED  OUT OF A COUPLE OF HOTELS. ON A STARBUCKS THEY SMASHED ALL  OF THE WINDOW AS THEY WERE  RUNNING BUY. ALL THAT HAPPENED A COUPLE OF  HOURS AGO. YOU'RE SEEING A NEW TEAM OF  OFFICERS SPECIALLY TRAINED WITH  RIOT GER AND THEY ARE MOVING IN. >> WE SEE SOME OBJECTS THAT  APPEAR TO BEING TOSSED AT THE  POLICE OFFICERS. THEY SEEM TO BE FORMING ALMOST A MOVING WALL NOW AS THEY CONTINUE TO TRY TO MOVE THE CROWD FARTHER UP THE STREET. AND TO CONTAIN THEM. AGAIN, THEY HAVE CERTAINLY BEEN  REHEARSING AND PRACTICING FOR  CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE AND SEEM TO  HAVE BEEN CONTROLLING THAT  STREET TO SOME EXTENT. BUT IT IS CLEARLY A VOLATILE  SITUATION ANY TIME THAT POLICE  ARE FORCED TO USE TEAR GAS OR  SOME OF THEIR NONLETHAL TACTICS. IT IS JARRING AS CHUCK POINTS  OUT.  >> SOME ARE ANARCHISTS THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH WANTEDING TO  PROTEST ALONG TODAY. A DIFFERENT TYPE OF PROTESTS. I THINK SOME OF THESE FOLKS  ARE --  >> BIG PROTESTS IS SCHEDULED FOR TOMORROW AND WOMEN COMING HERE  FROM ALL OVER AMERICA.  >> I DON'T THINK THIS HAS ANY  CONNECTION TO THAT.  >> PETE WILLIAMS IS IN OUR  WASHINGTON BUREAU AND HAS A  BETTER HANDLE ON THE SITUATION  WITH THE PROTESTS OVERALL. WHAT ARE YOU HEARING, PETE? >> LESTER, WASHINGTON, D.C.  POLICE WHO ARE IN CHARGE OF  KEEPING THE PEACE IN THE STREETS HERE, THIS IS NOT A SECRET  SERVICE OR FBI MISSION. THIS IS WASHINGTON POLICE. THEY SAY THEY HAVE ARRESTED 95  PEOPLE SO FAR TODAY. ONE PERSON WAS ARRESTED LAST  NIGHT IN A DEMONSTRATION OUTSIDE A PLACE WHERE SOME TRUMP  SUPPORTERS WERE GATHERING. THE WASHINGTON, D.C. ACTING  POLICE CHIEF STRESSES THAT THE  NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARRESTED AND  THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE  BROKEN WINDOWS AND TAKEN ON  OTHER VIOLENT ACTS IS A SMALL  NUMBER OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF  PROTESTERS BUT PRETTY MUCH THE  IMAGE THAT THESE VIOLENT  PROTESTERS WANTED. THEY WANTED THESE ENCOUNTERS  WITH THE POLICE TO DEMONSTRATE  THEIR UNHAPPINESS. THE POLICE CHIEF SAYS THAT  WINDOWS WERE BROKEN IN FOUR OR  FIVE BUSINESSES. THIS IS RIGHT AROUND AN AREA  CALLED FRANKLIN PARK, ABOUT SIX  BLOCKS NORTH OF THE PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE PARADE ROUTE, SO IT'S  WELL AWAY FROM WHERE THE  PRESIDENT WILL BE WALKING A FEW  HOURS FROM NOW.  >> PETE WILLIAMS, THANKS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO -- THANKS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE  SITUATION HERE. THE POLICE SEEM TO BE  SUCCESSFULLY MOVING THE CROWD  BACK. WE NOTE IT'S A VOLATILE  SITUATION AND JACOB RASCONE AND  OUR CREW WILL TAKE THE PROPER  PRECAUTION. WE ARE BACK HERE WITH OUR PANEL  AND TALKING 3 PASA, REGRESAMOS CON NUESTRO  OBVIOUSLY WE KNEW THERE WAS  GOING TO BE A LOT OF OPPOSITION  AND PROTESTS. THERE'S GOING TO BE A REACTION  TO THAT. AND I HAVE TO SAY PART OF ME  BELIEVES THAT WHEN YOU THINK  ABOUT SOME OF THE FOLKS AROUND  DONALD TRUMP THAT BELIEVE THIS  IS A GALVANIZING MOMENT AND THAT WE MAY VIEW THIS THAT HE MADE A  MISTAKE NOT TRYING TO UNIFY,  THEY SEE IT AS ALMOST CEMENTING  THEIR BASE AND REALIZING THIS IS GOING TO BE A POLITICAL WAR FOR  FOUR YEARS, KEEP THEIR TROOPS  FIRED UP AND READY TO GO. SO YOU MAY SEE -- THERE COULD BE AT TIMES WHERE WE MAY BE IN FOR  WHAT FEELS LIKE MORE POLARIZING  MOMENTS THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED. THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, SOME OF  THE LEADERS DON'T WANT TO BE AS  RESISTANT AS MAYBE THE RANK AND  FILE DOES. I THINK THAT TENSION WILL PLAY  ITSELF OUT. THAT TENSION WILL INCREASE  TENSION ON THE RIGHT TOO.  >> AND WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IS THE ORGANIZING CENTER OF ALL OF  THIS, FRANKLY, HOW MUCH OF THIS  IS RANDOM. THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT  GROUPS THAT WERE INVOLVED THERE. BUT YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT, I THINK  THAT I CAN SEE THE TRUMP PEOPLE  AT HOME SAYING GET 'EM. THIS IS WHY WE RAN, THIS IS WHY  HE WON. IT'S NOT ABOUT THEM IN THE  STREETS, IT'S ABOUT US IN THE  FACTORIES AND HOW HE WANTS TO  CHANGE EVERYTHING IN WASHINGTON. >> BUT WOULD A MESSAGE OF UNITY  NOT DIRECTED TO THE FOLKS IN THE STREET, BUT A BROADER MESSAGE OF UNITY, WOULD THAT HAVE PAID  DIVIDENDS DOWN THE ROAD? >> LOOK, I BELIEVE IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU BELIEVE IS THE BEST WAY TO SUCCEED AS PRESIDENT. YOU HAD RONALD REAGAN AND BILL  CLINTON, I ALWAYS SAID, WANTED  TO BE 60% PRESIDENTS. MEANING THEY KNEW THEY NEVER  WOULD GET 60% OF THE VOTE BUT  THE GOAL WAS A 60% APPROVAL  RATING. TO KNOW THAT YOU'VE GOT PEOPLE  ON THE OTHER SIDE THAT APPROVE  OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING. IN THE BUSH/OBAMA ERA, IT WAS A  50% PROPOSITION. IN SOME WAYS AND SOME TRUMP  PEOPLE BELIEVE THIS, THAT WE ARE IN SUCH POLARIZING TIMES, THAT  IF YOU HAVE A CORE 40% TO 45%,  MAYBE THAT'S ALL YOU NEED IF YOU KEEP THE OTHER SIDE OFF ITS  HEELS A LITTLE BIT, A LITTLE  DIVIDED. AND I'LL TELL YOU THAT I -- SO I THINK THAT WAS THE TENSION IN  THE SPEECH AND I HAVE NO DOUBT  TENSION INSIDE TRUMP WORLD. I THINK STEVE BANNON, THAT WAS A MARKER HE WANTED TO DO, CHIEF  ADVISOR. HE VERY MUCH BELIEVES THIS  NATIONALIST IDEOLOGY IS AN  INTERNATIONAL MOVEMENT. I THINK -- I'M SURE THE REINCE  PRIEBUS SIDE OF TRUMP'S ADVISERS ARE THINKING, BOY, THIS ISN'T  GOING TO HELP US GET CHUCK  SCHUMER TO WORK WITH US. SO THOSE TENSIONS I THINK ARE  GOING TO CONTINUE.  >> WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A BREAK. WHEN WE COME BACK, WE ARE GOING  TO HAVE A BROADER DISCUSSION  ABOUT THE FIRST FAMILY AND THEIR DIRECTION GOING FORWARD AS A  FAMILY AND THEIR IMPACT ON  AMERICA WHEN WE COME BACK FROM  WASHINGTON. >>> SO HELP ME GOD.  >> CONGRATULATIONS, MR.  PRESIDENT.  >> WHEN AMERICA IS UNITED,  AMERICA IS TOTALLY UNSTOPPABLE. >> NBC NEWS LIVE COVERAGE OF THE INAUGURATION OF DONALD TRUMP  CONTINUES. HERE'S LESTER HOLT. >> AND WELCOME BACK, EVERYONE. LUNCHEON UNDER WAY RIGHT NOW IN  THE HONOR OF THE FIRST FAMILY. WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE THEM IN  JUST A LITTLE BIT AFTER THAT  LUNCH AND THEY WILL THEN BEGIN  THE INAUGURATION PARADE, WHICH  OF COURSE WE'LL HAVE LIVE  COVERAGE. WE'RE ALSO WATCHING SOME  DISRUPTION ON THE STREETS OF  WASHINGTON RIGHT NOW. THERE HAVE BEEN SOME PROTESTS  AND APPARENTLY A FEW INJURIES  HERE. TEAR GAS OR PEPPER SPRAY BEING  USED ON THE CROWD. WE ALSO HEARD WHAT APPEAR TO BE  FLASH BANG GRENADES, THIS IN THE AREA OF 12th AND L, SEVERAL  BLOCKS FROM THE PARADE ROUTE  TODAY. THIS IS -- WE'RE TOLD THERE HAVE BEEN SOME PEOPLE WITHIN GROUPS  OF PROTESTERS WHO HAVE BEEN  THROWING OBJECTS AND POLICE  RESPONDED BY MOVING THEM BACK  WITH PEPPER SPRAY, THEIR SHIELDS AND THESE FLASH BANG GRENADES IT APPEARS, SO WE'RE GOING TO  CONTINUE TO WATCH THAT SITUATION PLAY OUT, LET YOU KNOW AS EVENTS WARRANT. BUT WE WANT TO TURN RIGHT NOW TO THE BROADER DISCUSSION ABOUT THE FIRST FAMILY. FOR THAT ROBIN GAVONN JOINS US. >> NICE TO BE HERE.  >> WE'VE SEEN THE NEW FIRST LADY A LOT TODAY BUT HAVEN'T SEEN HER A LOT DURING THE CAMPAIGN. SHE DIDN'T APPEAR A LOT. SHE SPOKE AT THE REPUBLICAN  NATIONAL CONVENTION. SHE'S TALKED ABOUT WANTING TO  CHAMPION ISSUES AGAINST  BULLYING. HOW WOULD YOU EXPECT SHE WILL  FIT INTO THIS KIND OF A ROLE? >> WELL, YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT  IT'S ALL SPECULATION BECAUSE SHE REALLY HAS BEEN NOT IN HIDING,  BUT CERTAINLY NOT IN THE  SPOTLIGHT. AND I THINK THE FIRST SENSE OF  THAT WE GOT TODAY JUST BY THE  WAY THAT SHE SORT OF HANDLED ALL THE ATTENTION, BY THE CHOICES  THAT SHE MADE IN TERMS OF HOW  SHE WANTED TO BE SEEN ON THE  CAPITOL STAGE AND IN THE  SPOTLIGHT. AND I THOUGHT SHE MADE SOME VERY SORT OF SMART, SUBTLE CHOICES. BY, FOR INSTANCE, DECIDING THAT  AMIDST ALL OF THE FUROR ABOUT  WHAT SHE WAS GOING TO WEAR AND  DESIGNERS NOT WANTING TO GET  INVOLVED THAT SHE WOULD CHOOSE  SOMEONE LIKE RALPH LAUREN, WHO  IS EXTREMELY BIPARTISAN. HE DRESSED HILLARY CLINTON FOR  THE INAUGURATION AS WELL. AND I THINK THOSE KINDS OF  SUBTLE DECISIONS, THOSE LITTLE  DETAILS SUGGEST THAT SHE IS  ATTUNED TO THE DIVISIVENESS OF  THIS PARTICULAR ELECTION AND  POSSIBLY, YOU KNOW, IT'S  SOMETHING THAT SHE WILL BE  KEENLY AWARE OF IN WHATEVER SHE  DECIDES TO TAKE ON.  >> YOU SEE HER AS BEING -- WE  SAW WITH FIRST LADY MICHELLE  OBAMA SHE BECAME SOMEWHAT OF A  FASHION ICON. THIS FIRST LADY IS A FORMER  MODEL, SO MORE PRESSURE ON HER? >> I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S  NECESSARILY MORE PRESSURE, BUT  IT MAKES HER MORE REMOVED AND IS MORE CHALLENGING FOR HER TO FORM THAT KIND OF WARM REAL WOMAN  RELATIONSHIP WITH THE VAST  CITIZENRY. MODELS, AFTER ALL, ARE RAREFIED  CREATURES, THEY ARE BORN, THEY  ARE NOT MADE. AND SO I THINK IT'S IN SOME WAYS SOMETHING SHE WILL HAVE TO  OVERCOME A LITTLE BIT.  >> HOW MUCH OF A STATEMENT DOES  IT MAKE, AN IMPORTANT STATEMENT, THAT SHE IS STAYING IN NEW YORK  FOR THE TIME BEING WITH HER  YOUNGEST SON TO GET HIM THROUGH  THE SCHOOL YEAR BEFORE MOVING  ON. THAT'S THE KIND OF DECISION A  LOT OF FAMILIES HAVE TO MAKE  WHEN THERE IS A JOB RELOCATION.  >> I THINK IT SAYS THAT SHE'S  GOING TO DO THIS VERY MUCH IN  HER OWN WAY. YOU KNOW, AS MUCH AS PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE ROLE OF FIRST LADY IS  DEFINED BY THE WOMAN OR THE  SPOUSE WHO IS IN IT, I THINK IN  GENERAL WE TEND TO SEE THEM KIND OF FALL WITHIN CERTAIN  PARAMETERS. SHE IS FALLING AS FAR OUTSIDE OF THOSE PARAMETERS THAT I THINK  WE'VE SEEN IN A LONG TIME.  >> MICHELLE OBAMA BROUGHT HER  MOM TO COME HELP WITH THE KIDS  AT THE TIME. THEY WERE VERY YOUNG WHEN THEY  MOVED IN. MELANIA'S FAMILY, HER SIDE OF  THE FAMILY, IS SHE GOING TO  BRING SOME HELP WITH HER? IT IS BALANCING THAT DUTY OF  BEING THERE FOR YOUR SCHOOL-AGE  CHILD AND AT THE SAME TIME SOME  OF THE DUTIES THAT COME WITH THE OFFICE. >> AS SOME WOULD SAY, YOU KNOW,  THAT'S NOT A QUESTION THAT YOU  WOULD ASK DONALD TRUMP. IS HE BRINGING ALONG A FAMILY  MEMBER TO HELP HIM CARE FOR HIS  SON. BUT AS FAR AS WE KNOW, THERE'S  BEEN NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT SHE IS PLANNING TO BRING A FAMILY  MEMBER AND SHE HAS SPOKEN QUITE  EMPHATICALLY THAT SHE IS A MOM  FIRST AND THAT SHE DOESN'T WORK  WITH A NANNY, THAT SHE'S VERY  HANDS-ON. SO I MEAN IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT IS GOING TO BE A SIGNIFICANT  PORTION OF HER ROLE. BUT JUST AS WITH MICHELLE OBAMA, SHE BALANCED THAT OUT. SHE LIMITED THE AMOUNT OF TIME  THAT SHE WORKED PUBLICLY AND  SPENT A GOOD PORTION OF HER TIME WORKING WITH HER GIRLS WHEN THEY WERE YOUNGER.  >> DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN,  PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN, IS WITH  US AGAIN. DORIS, HOW LONG HAS THERE  HISTORICALLY BEEN THIS PRESSURE, OR NOT PRESSURE, BUT EXPECTATION ON FIRST LADIES TO HAVE A  SPECIFIC DEFINED ROLE OR CAUSE? >> YOU KNOW, I THINK OBVIOUSLY  ELEANOR ROOSEVELT STARTED IT IN  A CERTAIN WAY. I REMEMBER HEARING WHEN SHE  TALKED TO BESS TRUMAN COMING IN  AFTER HER, DO YOU WANT ME TO  INTRODUCE YOU TO THE WOMEN OF  THE PRESS BECAUSE I HELD WEEKLY  PRESS CONFERENCES WITH HEM, AND  BESS SAID WHAT? I'M NOT GOING TO BE TALKING WITH THE PRESS. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO GIVE  EACH FIRST LADY SPACE TO BE THE  KIND OF FIRST LADY THEY WANT TO  BE. IF BALANCING THE KIDS IS FIRST,  IF THEY WANT A CERTAIN ISSUE, IT SEEMS AS WHAT WE'VE HAD RECENTLY IS THE FIRST LADIES FOLLOWING ON ONE OR TWO PARTICULAR ISSUES,  WHETHER IT'S LITERACY,  ALCOHOLISM OR OBESITY. AND THEY HAVE TO DECIDE IT FOR  THEMSELVES. THEY DIDN'T RUN FOR OFFICE, AND  I THINK BOTH THE MEDIA AND THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE TO LET THEM DECIDE AS IT FITS THEIR LIFE AND FITS WHO THEY ARE.  >> AND, DORIS, LET ME EXPAND THE CONVERSATION TO DONALD TRUMP. HE TENDS TO HAVE, YOU KNOW, KIND OF ONE VOLUME. WE COUNT OR LOOK TO OUR  PRESIDENTS TO BE CONSOLERS AT  TIMES, TO INSPIRE US DURING  TOUGH AND CHALLENGING MOMENTS IN OUR HISTORY. HOW WILL -- HOW MUCH WILL DONALD TRUMP DIFFER FROM PAST  PRESIDENTS WITH REGARD TO THAT  ROLE? >> I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT  HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO EVOLVE TO  LEARN HOW TO DO, BECAUSE YOU DO  NEED A DIFFERENT KIND OF -- I  SEE EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,  THAT ONE VOLUME AND THAT ONE  KIND OF FIGHTING SPIRIT. TEDDY ROOSEVELT HAD THAT SIMILAR KIND OF FIGHTING SPIRIT AND HE  COULD SPEAK IN SHORT, CATCHY  PHRASES AS MR. TRUMP CAN AS  WELL. BUT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN YOU  HAVE TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT  FOR THE NATION. YOU HAVE TO BE THERE WHEN  THERE'S A KILLING, YOU HAVE TO  BE THERE AS A CHALLENGER AS  REAGAN WAS. THE BEST PRESIDENTS KNOW HOW TO  BE FUNNY AT TIMES, THEY KNOW HOW TO BE SYMPATHETIC AT TIMES, THEY KNOW HOW TO BE FIGHTING SPIRITS  AT TIME AND TO BE UNIFYING AT  TIMES. THAT'S THE DIFFERENT HATS THAT A PRESIDENT HAS TO WEAR. AND THE VOICE AND THE TONE WILL  BE A VERY BIG PART OF THAT. THAT'S WHY I WISH TODAY THERE  HAD BEEN THAT OTHER VOICE AS WE  WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER, NOT  JUST THE FIGHTING VOICE TODAY  BUT THE ONE THAT HE SHOWED AFTER THE ELECTION NIGHT. YOU NEED TO BRING THOSE VOICES  TOGETHER IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE  AN EFFECTIVE PRESIDENT.  >> WELL, THERE'S A LOT TO LEARN  I GUESS BEING A PRESIDENT AND  YOU'VE GOT TO COME UP TO SPEED  VERY QUICKLY. I THINK WE ALL WISH HIM THE BEST AS HE TAKES HIS NEW ROLE. DORIS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE'VE BEEN ON SEVERAL SPLIT  SCREENS TODAY FOR VARIOUS  REASONS. ONE OF THE SITUATIONS WE'RE  WATCHING IS AN OUTBREAK OF SOME  VIOLENCE, THINGS BEING THROWN  AND POLICE RESPONDING AROUND  12th AND ""I"" HERE IN WASHINGTON. LET'S GO BACK TO JACOB RASCON. JACOB, HOW ARE THINGS NOW? >> Reporter: LESTER, I WOULD SAY IN ALL TODAY WE'VE HAD MAYBE A  THOUSAND PROTESTERS AND WE HAVE  NOW A SMALL GROUP OF PROTESTERS  WEARING ALL BLACK AND THEY HAVE  THEIR FACES COVERED WHO HAVE  BEEN BATTLING BACK AND FORTH  WITH POLICE NOW FOR ABOUT A HALF HOUR. OFF AND ON, THE PROTESTERS WILL  THROW ROCKS OR BRICKS OR OTHER  OBJECTS AT THE POLICE AND THEY  WILL RESPOND BY SPRAYING  SOMETHING LIKE PEPPER SPRAY AND  AS WELL THROWING FLASH BANGS,  JUST REALLY LOUD. JUST MOMENTS AGO, THEY RUSHED  FROM WHERE THEY WERE, THEIR  POSITION, THEIR LINE, AND THEY  MOVED IT SO THEY CREATED SPACE  IN THE INTERSECTION. AS THEY DID THAT, SOME OF THE  PROTESTERS RESISTED MOVING AND  THEY WERE PUSHED AND SPRAYED  WITH PEPPER SPRAY. AND SO NOW WE'RE AT A STAND  STILL HERE UNTIL PEOPLE START  THROWING ROCKS AGAIN, WHICH I  EXPECT THEY MIGHT DO, BECAUSE  IT'S BEEN A CONSTANT OVER THE  LAST HALF HOUR OR SO. LESTER.  >> ALL RIGHT, JACOB, THANKS FOR  KEEPING AN EYE THERE AND TAKING  CARE OF YOU AND YOUR CREW. LET ME GO TO KATE SNOW RIGHT  NOW. SHE'S AT JOHN MARSHALL PARK  WHERE WE'RE GROUP HAS BEEN OUT  TODAY VOWING TO PROTECT THE  PRESIDENT AND THE PARADE AREA  FROM PROTESTERS, BIKERS FOR  TRUMP. WHAT'S GOING ON THERE? >> Reporter: WE'RE ABOUT SIX  BLOCKS TO THE EAST AND SIX  BLOCKS TO THE SOUTH OF WHERE  JACOB IS, WHERE YOU'RE SEEING  THOSE PROTESTS GOING ON. THIS IS SUCH A DIFFERENT SCENE. YOU SEE ALL KINDS OF FAMILIES  HERE, A LOT OF ""MAKE AMERICA  GREAT AGAIN"" HATS AND AS YOU  SAID WE HAVE THE BIKERS FOR  TRUMP WHO GOT A PERMIT TO BE  HERE TODAY. THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF THEM  ALL BEHIND US HERE. I'VE GOT WITH ME EDDIE, SHAWN,  JOE, JIMMY, JIMMY AND MARK. WE'VE GOT A BUNCH OF THEM. MOST OF YOU GUYS ARE FROM NEW  JERSEY.  >> YES.  >> EDDIE, YOU CAME IN FROM NEW  JERSEY AND IT'S YOUR FIRST  INAUGURATION.  >> YES.  >> NONE OF YOU HAVE BEEN HERE  BEFORE.  >> HERE FOR TRUMP.  >> WHAT DID YOU THINK OF HIS  SPEECH.  >> I THOUGHT IT WAS INCREDIBLE. HE'S PATRIOTIC. HE'S LOOKING OUT FOR THE WORKING MAN, WHICH IS US.  >> WHAT WAS THE MESSAGE THAT  RESONATED WITH YOU? YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE  PEOPLE.  >> HE'S BRINGING THE POWER BACK  FOR US. HE'S HERE TO US TO SUPPORT US,  LOOKING OUT FOR US.  >> ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HE  SAID WAS YOU WILL NOT BE IGNORED AGAIN. HE TWEETED THAT AS WELL. IS THAT WHAT YOU FELT WHEN YOU  HEARD IT? >> ABSOLUTELY. HAPPY NOBAMA DAY, BY THE WAY.  >> YOU ARE HAPPY TO SEE OBAMA  GET ON THAT PLANE.  >> ABSOLUTELY. WE ARE ALL PALT YUTS AND WE  BELIEVE TRUMP IS A TRUE PATRIOT. HE'S HERE FOR THE PEOPLE FROM  COAST TO COAST, BORDER TO  BORDER. HE'S HERE FROM ALL THE PEOPLE IN AMERICA. THAT'S WHY WE LOVE HIM.  >> WHAT DID YOU THINK ABOUT THE  PROTESTERS? THEY WERE HERE BY OUR CHECKPOINT A LITTLE BIT EARLIER AND YOU  WERE ALL WATCHING THEM VERY  KEENLY, OCCASIONALLY YELLING A  FEW THINGS AT THEM. THEY'RE UP RIGHT NO BLOCKS AWAY  FROM US MAKING A -- DISRUPTING  SOME STUFF AND EVEN DOING SOME  DAMAGE.  >> I THINK, NUMBER ONE, I DON'T  HAVE THE TIME TO PROTEST BECAUSE I HAVE A JOB. NUMBER TWO, THEIR BEHAVIOR TODAY IS THE REASON THAT PRESIDENT  TRUMP WAS ELECTED AND THE REASON HE GETS ELECTED FOR A SECOND  TERM.  >> YOU GUYS HAVE SAID THAT YOUR  LEADER SAID YOU WILL BE A WALL  OF MEAT IF YOU'RE NEEDED TODAY. SO FAR EVERYTHING IS SUPER  PEACEFUL HERE. THERE'S BEEN NO INTERACTION  BETWEEN THE BIKERS AND THE  PROTESTERS? >> ACTUALLY WE SPENT THE LAST  COUPLE DAYS JUST TAKING PICTURE  AFTER PICTURE. THE PUBLIC HAS BEEN SO THANKFUL  FOR US BEING HERE AND IT'S  BEEN -- IT'S BEEN REALLY GREAT.  >> I DO HAVE TO SAY AS WE'VE  BEEN STANDING HERE, LESTER,  WAITING FOR YOU TO COME TO US,  WE'VE BEEN HERE 40 MINUTES AND  PEOPLE ONE AFTER THE NEXT ARE  COMING UP AND WANTING PICTURES  WITH THESE GUYS. JUST ONE OTHER NOTE. I'VE TALKED TO A LOT OF PEOPLE  IN THE CROWD WHO DROVE MILES AND MILES. A FAMILY FROM MINNESOTA, OTHERS  FROM THE CAROLINAS, YOU'RE FROM  SAN DIEGO, AND THEY JUST WANTED  TO BE HERE. MANY, MANY PEOPLE, LESTER,  TELLING ME THAT THEY HAVE NEVER  BEEN TO WASHINGTON, D.C., BEFORE AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THEY  FELT THAT THEY WERE WELCOME AND  THAT THEY SHOULD COME FOR AN  INAUGURATION. LESTER.  >> THERE'S NOTHING QUITE LIKE AN INAUGURATION. KATE SNOW, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE ARE KEEPING OUR EYE ON THE  CAPITOL. IF THEY'RE ON SCHEDULE RIGHT  NOW, THE NEW PRESIDENT AND HIS  FAMILY SHOULD BE MOVING INTO A  HOLDING ROOM EXITING THE  LUNCHEON THERE IN THE CAPITOL. IN A SHORT WHILE, WE WOULD  EXPECT TO SEE THE PRESIDENT WITH A REVIEW OF THE TROOPS BEFORE  LEAVING THE CAPITOL AND  BEGINNING THE INAUGURAL PARADE. WE'LL BE WATCHING IT ALL FOR  YOU. AS SOON AS HE COMES BACK INTO  VIEW, WE WILL TRAIN OUR CAMERAS  ON HIM. BUT WE WILL TAKE A BREAK. MORE COVERAGE OF THE  PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION WHEN  WE CONTINUE ON NBC NEWS. >>> WELCOME BACK. CONTRAST TODAY FROM THE CAPITOL  AND THE PAGEANTRY OF THE  DARK IN MY VIEW. THESE THEMES ABOUT THE FORGOTTEN MAN AND WOMAN AND THE LINE THAT  REALLY SORT OF GRABBED ME AND  TOOK ME A MINUTE TO SORT OF  PROCESS AND REALLY UNDERSTAND  HIS CONNECTION WITH HIS VOTERS  WAS THAT LINE ABOUT HOW  FACTORIES CLOSED, PEOPLE  SUFFERED, AND YET IN THE HALLS  OF POWER, IN THE HALLS OF  WASHINGTON PEOPLE ENRICHED  THEMSELVES. THAT WAS AMERICA'S SORT OF  ANTHEM OR ANSWER TO BREXIT. I THOUGHT HE REALLY HUGGED THAT. INSTEAD OF SORT OF TURNING AWAY  FROM SOME OF THAT DIVISIVE  LANGUAGE, HE WANTS TO DIVIDE US  ALONG NEW LINES, IT WOULD SEEM. HE REALLY IS EMBRACING THE CLASS WARFARE THAT REPUBLICANS HAVE  TYPICALLY REJECTED. IT USED TO BE DEMOCRATS THAT  TRIED TO WAGE NATIONAL CAMPAIGNS ALONG LINES OF CLASS WARFARE. HE'S NOT JUST EMBRACING THEM,  HE'S REALLY DOUBLING DOWN ON  THEM. WE TALKED ABOUT THE SPEECH ABOUT HOW OF ALL THE PRESIDENTS ON THE DAIS TODAY NONE OF THEM VOTED  FOR HIM, THAT'S BECAUSE THEY  WERE AGAINST THE ISOLATIONISM  AND THE PROTECTIONISM AND THE  NATIVISM THAT WERE SOME OF THE  CENTRAL THEMES OF HIS SPEECH.  >> TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK WAS  GOING THROUGH GEORGE W. BUSH'S  MIND. IT FELT LIKE AT TIMES HE WAS  REPUDIATING EVERY SINGLE  PRESIDENT ON THAT DAIS.  >> I TEXTED ONE OF OUR  COLLEAGUES DURING THE SPEECH AND I SAID DOES IT FEEL TO YOU LIKE  HE IS REALLY SAYING, IT'S NOT  LOST ON ME THAT NONE OF THE FOUR OF YOU VOTED FOR ME. AND SO I'M GOING TO LUMP YOU IN  WITH EVERYONE THAT I AM GOING TO STAND UP TO. BUT WE CAN'T UNDERESTIMATE HOW  EFFECTIVE IT WAS DURING THE  CAMPAIGN. BUT I THINK IT'S LEGITIMATE TO  QUESTION HOW HELPFUL IT'S GOING  TO BE AS HE HAS TO NOW GOVERN.  >> I TALK ABOUT THE INCREDIBLE  SPLIT SCREEN MOMENTS OF THE DAY. LET'S GO BACK TO THAT SITUATION  ON THE STREETS OF WASHINGTON  RIGHT NOW. JACOB RASCON, IT APPEARS THERE'S MORE ACTION HAPPENING.  >> SINCE WE LAST SPOKE, WHAT  WE'VE SEEN IS JUST MORE PUSH AND SHOVE. THE POLICE LINE MOVED FORWARD,  SOME PROTESTERS RESISTED. THEY HAVE BEEN PICKING UP BRICKS FROM OFF OF THE STREET,  LITERALLY JUST BREAKING THE  STREET. PICKING UP THE BRICKS AND  TOSSING THEM AT POLICE AND THE  POLICE RESPOND WITH THE FLASH  BANGS, WITH THE PEPPER SPRAY. I'VE BEEN ABLE TO TALK TO SOME  OF THESE PROTESTERS AND THEY  RARELY WANT TO IDENTIFY  THEMSELVES AS WE SPOKE BEFORE,  THEY COVER THEIR FACES AND WEAR  ALL BLACK. BUT SOME OF THEM ARE WILLING TO  SAY THAT THEY CAME FROM CHICAGO  OR THEY CAME FROM DENVER OR  OTHER PLACES. THEY TRAVELED HERE SPECIFICALLY  FOR THIS. THEY WANTED TO MAKE A STATEMENT. IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE DOING IT. I SPOKE TO ONE PERSON FROM  CHICAGO WHO CAME HERE WHO STOOD  WITH STANDING ROCK. THAT WAS HIS PURPOSE HERE. LET'S WALK OVER HERE BECAUSE I  WANT TO SHOW YOU AN EXAMPLE OF  WHAT HAPPENS ALONG THE ROUTE. SOMETIMES WE SEE THINGS LIKE  THIS. ALONG THE WAY THEY TAKE THE  BRICKS OR THE ROCKS AND THEY  SMASH IN THE WINDOWS. THIS HAPPENING TO BE A  LIMOUSINE. SO MOST OF THE PROTESTERS I WANT TO EMPHASIZE DON'T SEEM TO BE  HERE TO CAUSE VIOLENCE OR  TROUBLE LIKE THIS. BUT A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE ARE  SPECIFICALLY HERE TO CAUSE  TROUBLE WHEREVER THEY GO. THEY'RE KNOCKING OVER TRASH  CANS, PULLING OUT NEWSSTANDS AND SMASHING WINDOWS AND THEN AGAIN  THROWING BRICKS AND ROCKS. A SMALL NUMBER OF THE  PROTESTERS, BUT THEY'RE CAUSING  A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF PROBLEMS HERE. LESTER.  >> ARE THEY TRYING TO CORRAL  THEM INTO A SPECIFIC AREA? THEY KEEP PUSHING THEM DOWN THE  STREET. ARE THEY AIMING TOWARD A TARGET? >> IT SEEMS THAT THAT'S WHAT  THEY'RE TRYING TO DO AND IN FACT BEFORE THE SWEARING-IN AS WE  SPOKE EARLIER, THEY WERE  SUCCESSFUL IN THAT. THEY HAD A FEW HUNDRED POLICE  OFFICERS COMING FROM DIFFERENT  SIDES OF AN INTERSECTION AND  THEY HAD CORNERED THEM AND IT  WAS LIKE THAT AND QUIET FOR A  COUPLE OF HOURS AND THEN THERE  WAS THE PUSH AND SHOVE. EVER SINCE THEN, THEY CAN'T SEEM TO GET AROUND THEM. IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO DO SO BECAUSE IN EVERY DIRECTION  AND AS WE TURN AROUND YOU'LL  SEE, MOST OF THESE ARE JUST  PEOPLE AT THIS POINT WATCHING  WHO ARE NOT INVOLVED IN THE  PROTEST. BUT IT WOULD BE VERY, VERY  DIFFICULT TO CORNER THESE  PROTESTERS AT THIS POINT. >> IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME WHAT  THEY'RE PROTESTING AT THIS POINT EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT DONALD  TRUMP WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT AND  THEY MAY DISAGREE WITH SOME OF  HIS POLICIES, BUT THERE'S NO  DEFINITION TO THIS PROTEST, IS  THERE? ARE THEY HOLDING UP SIGNS SAYING THIS IS WHAT ENRAGES US? >> TOM, I WOULD SAY THAT DURING  DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN I  HAPPENED TO COVER A LOT OF THE  PROTESTS AT HIS RALLIES. IT JUST SO HAPPENED THAT THERE  WAS USUALLY A SMALL NUMBER OF  PEOPLE WHO WOULD COVER THEIR  FACES AND DO THIS KIND OF THING. IT WASN'T SO MUCH ABOUT DONALD  TRUMP TO THEM, AS I TALKED WITH  THEM, AS IT WAS JUST  ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT. THEY NOT ONLY HATED, THEY SAID,  DONALD TRUMP, THEY ALSO HATED,  THEY SAID, HILLARY CLINTON AND  THEY HATED CONGRESS AND THEY  HATED A LOT OF THINGS. AND SO IT WAS NOT SPECIFICALLY  DONALD TRUMP ALONE, IT WAS THE  ESTABLISHMENT, THEY CALLED IT. THEY WERE SICK AND TIRED OF A  LAUNDRY LIST OF THINGS. AND SO IT WASN'T VERY FOCUSED. IT WASN'T ONE PURPOSE. AND THOSE WHO DO HAVE A PURPOSE, LIKE THE QUEER RESISTANCE GROUP  THAT WAS OUT EARLIER TODAY OR  THOSE STANDING WITH STANDING  ROCK, THEY AREN'T USUALLY THE  TYPES THAT WE SEE CAUSE THAT  TROUBLE.  >> AND WE KNOW THOSE ARE  NONLETHAL GRENADES BEING SET OFF BUT THEY CERTAINLY ARE JARRING  TO HEAR THOSE EXPLOSIONS IN THE  STREET. JACOB, THANKS VERY MUCH. NICOLLE, A LITTLE WHILE AGO WE  WERE HEARING FROM BIKERS FOR  TRUMP. THEY NOTED THE PROTESTERS AND  THE IMAGERY THAT THAT SENDS. IN THE BROADER PICTURE, WHAT  DOES THAT SAY WHEN THAT PICTURE  GETS PUT ALONGSIDE A PEACEFUL  SWEARING-IN OF DONALD TRUMP.  >> I AGREE WITH THE BIKERS WHO  SAID THAT THAT'S PART OF WHY HE  WON. THERE WAS A MOMENT DURING THE  CAMPAIGN, I THINK IT WAS OVER  THE SUMMER, WHERE THERE WERE  EXTRAORDINARY FLASH POINTS OF  VIOLENCE. I THINK IT WAS IN CHICAGO. AND HIS CONVENTION SPEECH I  THINK WAS A REACTION TO THAT  VIOLENT PERIOD OVER THE SUMMER  WHERE HE TALKED ABOUT LAW AND  ORDER. AND IT'S BEEN GENERATIONS SINCE  THE NATIONAL POLITICAL FIGURES  TALKED ABOUT LAW AND ORDER IN A  CONVENTION SPEECH. SO IT WASN'T JUST AN  UNDERCURRENT. ONE OF THE THEMES OF HIS  CANDIDACY WAS TO SORT OF RESTORE LAW AND ORDER. AND FRANKLY, WHEN HE MADE HIS  PITCH AND HIS CASE TO THE INNER  CITIES, HE TALKED ABOUT CURBING  VIOLENCE AND STRENGTHENING  POLICE AND STANDING BEHIND LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENTS.  >> YOU SEE THAT VEHICLE THAT'S  BEING ATTACKED THERE. >> TOM, ALL THROUGH THIS  CAMPAIGN MANY TIMES YOU, PETER  HART, A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT I'VE  LEARNED FROM AND LOOK UP TO  ALWAYS WERE PAINTING THIS  PICTURE IN '68 TOGETHER. DO YOU SEE -- DO YOU FEEL '68,  '69, THAT PERIOD? THAT'S WHAT'S SO -- IT'S LIKE ON ONE HAND --  >> IT'S NOT TO SCALE, RIGHT? IT'S NOT TO SCALE.  >> THE PICTURE MAY BE THAT WAY  AND THE POLITICS ARE THAT  DIVISIVE, BUT IT FEELS LIKE AN  ALTERNATIVE REALITY.  >> THE CLOSE-UP HERE IS THE FACT IS YOU PULL BACK, THERE ARE NOT  THAT MANY PEOPLE. THEY'RE SHUTTING DOWN A STREET. THEY SHUT DOWN THE ENTIRE  CAPITOL AND TOOK OVER THE  WASHINGTON MONUMENT AND  PRESIDENT NIXON WENT OUT IN THE  MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT TO TRY TO  TALK TO THEM ABOUT WHAT WAS  GOING ON BECAUSE THAT WAS DRIVEN BY THE MORAL IMPERATIVE OF  VIETNAM AND GOING TO WAR. IT'S ALSO WORTH POINT OUT, ONCE  THEY ENDED THE DRAFT, BANG, A  LOT OF THE DEMONSTRATIONS ENDED  RIGHT AWAY. HERE IT'S UNCLEAR TO ME. THIS IS A KIND OF FORMLESS  PROTEST FOR THE SAKE OF  PROTESTING.  >> IT'S LIKE THE G-8 PROTESTS. THEY'RE JUST ANARCHISTS. JACOB HAS HEARD THEM TALK ABOUT  HOW THE PROTESTERS HAVE MASKS  ON. IF YOU'RE PROTESTING FOR A  CAUSE, YOU USE THE MEDIA TO GET  OUT YOUR MESSAGE.  >> LET'S HEAR FROM SOME PEOPLE  RIGHT NOW WHO ARE HERE IN  WASHINGTON AND NOT NECESSARILY  IN SUPPORT OF TRUMP. CRAIG MELVIN IS AT FREEDOM  PLAZA. CRAIG, WHAT ARE YOU HEARING  THERE? >> LESTER, THESE ARE TWO LADIES  OUT FROM YOUR NECK OF THE WOODS, FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO AREA, AND THEY'RE IN TOWN FOR THE MARCH  TOMORROW, BUT THEY ALSO DECIDED  TO SPEND SOME TIME AT THE  INAUGURATION TODAY. THIS IS DIANE, THIS IS DARCY. WHY DID YOU FEEL IT WAS SO  IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO BE HERE? >> I WANTED TO COME HERE AND  HAVE MY VOICE BE HEARD. I THINK THAT WE ARE ENTERING  INTO A TIME THAT COULD BE  EXTREMELY DISRUPTIVE TO THE  RIGHTS THAT WE'VE GAINED OVER  THE LAST 200 YEARS AND --  >> MORE SPECIFICALLY.  >> WELL, I'VE GOT THEM ALL  LISTED HERE ON MY SIGN. I'M AFRAID WOMEN WILL LOSE THEIR RIGHT TO REPRODUCTIVE CHOICE,  I'M AFRAID ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO OUR ENVIRONMENT WITH  CLIMATE CHANGE, I'M AFRAID THAT  OUR WORLD AND OUR NATION WILL  BECOME MUCH MORE DIVIDED IN  TERMS OF RACE DIVISION, GENDER  EQUALITY, EDUCATION, SAVING  PUBLIC EDUCATION IS VERY  IMPORTANT TO ME. I'M A RETIRED EDUCATOR AND  THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT PART FOR ME TO REALLY PAY ATTENTION TO. SO WE'RE HERE FROM CALIFORNIA TO PROTEST IN A WAY THAT IS GOING  TO BE MEANINGFUL, AND WE'RE  TRYING TO THINK ABOUT WHAT CAN  WE DO IN OUR OWN LIVES TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.  >> DARCY, YOU HAVE A CREATIVE  SIGN THAT YOU BROUGHT WITH YOU  FROM SAN FRANCISCO.  >> YES, I DO. WELL, I THINK FOR ME THIS WHOLE  ELECTION CYCLE WAS DISAPPOINTING N MANY FRONTS. I THINK THE LEVEL OF DIALOGUE  WE'VE HAD IS UNACCEPTABLE AND WE SHOULD HOLD PEOPLE TO HIGHER  STANDARDS. FOR ME THIS IS ABOUT UPHOLDING  OUR VALUES AS AMERICANS AND  THINKING ABOUT LIBERTY AND  JUSTICE FOR ALL. THAT'S REALLY WHY I'M HERE. I TALK TO PEOPLE OUT ON THE  STREET, I TALK TO TAXI DRIVERS,  PEOPLE ARE AFRAID. PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO PRACTICE  THEIR RELIGION, THEY'RE AFRAID  THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE  DEPORTED, THEY'RE AFRAID THAT  THEY'RE GOING TO LOSE THEIR  HEALTH CARE. I THINK ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE  IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE A  CONVERSATION ABOUT.  >> DARCY, YOU POINTED OUT A FEW  MINUTES AGO AS THE UNREST  STARTED TO UNFOLD, WE SHOULD  NOTE THAT'S SIX, SEVEN BLOCKS  FROM WHERE WE ARE, BUT YOU SAID  YOU COULD ALMOST SMELL THE TEAR  GAS.  >> YEAH, YOU CAN SMELL THE TEAR  GAS. I HOPE THAT THAT'S NOT THE WAY  THAT THIS GOES FROM NOW ON. I REALLY THINK WE NEED TO START  HAVING IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS,  EDUCATED CONVERSATIONS, NOT  BASED ON RUMOR, NOT BASED ON  EMOTION, BUT BASED ON FACTS.  >> DARCY, DIANE, THANK YOU BOTH. SAFE TRAVELS. AGAIN, LESTER, JUST SOME  PERSPECTIVE HERE FOR OUR  VIEWERS, WHERE JACOB WAS, WHERE  JACOB IS RIGHT NOW, THAT'S  OUTSIDE THE SECURE ZONE SIX OR  SEVEN BLOCKS. YOU CAN PROBABLY START TO HEAR  THE ANNOUNCER ALONG THE PARADE  ROUTE GETTING READY FOR THAT  PARADE THAT'S GOING TO START  HERE LESS THAN AN HOUR FROM NOW. >> ALL RIGHT, CRAIG, THOSE  LADIES ARTICULATING THEIR  DISSENT IN WAYS CERTAINLY THAT'S MORE PRODUCTIVE THAN WHAT WE SAW IN THOSE OTHERS PICTURES. I WANT TO PICK UP, NICOLLE, ON  SOMETHING THE WOMEN WERE TALKING ABOUT, THE SENSE OF FEAR. WE SPENT SOME TIME TALKING TO  VOTERS AND I KEPT HEARING ABOUT  THIS FEAR, BUT A LOT OF IT WAS  BASED ON WHAT THEY THINK MIGHT  HAPPEN. WE HAVE TO REMIND OURSELVES THAT A LOT OF -- THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS CHANGED AND PUT NUANCES ON A LOT OF HIS POSITIONS ON THINGS  LIKE IMMIGRATION AND THE MUSLIM  BAN. >> ABORTION. >> WE DON'T QUITE KNOW -- WE  DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND WHERE  HE'S AT. WE'RE AFRAID ALMOST OF THE  UNKNOWN.  >> EXACTLY. SHE TALKED ABOUT REPRODUCTIVE  RIGHTS. I ASKED A GROUP OF THREE WOMEN  WHO HAD VOTED FOR PRESIDENT  OBAMA TWICE, WHO VOTED FOR TRUMP IN THIS ELECTION YEAR, IS HE  PRO-LIFE OR PRO-CHOICE. WHAT ARE YOU? THEY WERE ALL PRO-CHOICE. WHY ARE YOU AFRAID? WELL, I THINK HE'S JUST GOING TO LISTEN. I THINK EVERYTHING IS UP FOR  NEGOTIATION. SO IT DEPENDS WHERE YOU COME  DOWN ON THE TRUMP QUESTION. IF YOU'RE FOR HIM, YOU LIKE THAT HE SAID POSITIVE THINGS ABOUT  PLANNED PARENTHOOD BECAUSE YOU  THINK IT SIGNALS SOME  FLEXIBILITY. IF YOU'RE AGAINST HIM, YOU  PROJECT ONTO HIM YOUR WORST  FEARS ABOUT WHERE HE'S GOING TO  LAND.  >> IF I SAY MUSLIMS RIGHT NOW,  HOW WOULD YOU ARTICULATE WHERE  HE STANDS? >> I THINK WHERE HE LANDED WAS  IN FAVOR OF EXTREME VETTING FROM PEOPLE OF COUNTRIES WHERE  TERRORISM IS A THREAT. THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF HIS  CURRENT POSITION, RIGHT.  >> I THINK THAT'S A FAIR WAY. BUT WHAT I KEEP PICKING UP  TODAY, ESPECIALLY AGAIN, THE  INFORMATION DIVIDE. >> YES.  >> THERE'S SUCH APOCALYPTIC  LANGUAGE RIGHT NOW USED TO  DESCRIBE EACH POLITICAL SIDE  THAT YOU CAN HEAR WHAT'S AMAZING IS THAT THIS IS THE DAMAGE THAT  THIS I THINK APOCALYPTIC  LANGUAGE THAT IS USED BY LEFT  AND RIGHT TO DESCRIBE THE OTHER  SIDE IS THAT THE SUPPORTERS ECHO IT BACK. THEY'RE PARROTING SORT OF THE  MOST DISTORTED STEREOTYPE OF THE OTHER SIDE. AND THIS TO ME, THIS IS THE  INFORMATION DIVIDE THAT HAS  HELPED FRANKLY MAKE IT EASIER TO POLARIZE.  >> WELL, WHEN THE PRESIDENT GOES BY THIS PARTICULAR STRETCH OF  PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE, HE'LL SEE  TAMRON HALL THERE AS WELL AS HIS NEW HOTEL WITH A BIG SIGN. TAMRON, SET THE SCENE FOR US  THERE.  >> SO HERE'S WHAT WE'VE SEEN  HAPPEN IN THE LAST TEN MINUTES. PEOPLE THAT WE BELIEVE ARE  EMPLOYEES OF THIS TRUMP HOTEL,  WHICH OPENED SEPTEMBER 2016,  HAVE WALKED OUT. THEY HAVE A HUGE SIGN SAYING  THANK YOU TO THE NEW PRESIDENT. IT'S BELIEVED, LESTER, THAT THE  PRESIDENT WILL STOP HERE  POSSIBLY IN FRONT OF HIS HOTEL. NOW, TO MY LEFT NOT VERY FAR  AWAY, A DECENT-SIZE GROUP OF  PROTESTERS AND FOR A MINUTE OR  TWO THERE WAS A CHANT GOING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THESE  PROTESTERS AND SOME OF THESE  PEOPLE, AGAIN, WHO APPEAR TO  WORK AT TRUMP INTERNATIONAL. THIS HOTEL WILL LATER ALSO BE A  PART OF THE DISCUSSION OF  CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. THIS PARTICULAR HOTEL IS LEASED  BY THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION. THEY PAY $3 MILLION A MONTH FOR  THIS HOTEL. BUT ACCORDING TO THE LEASE, IT  CANNOT BE OWNED BY AN ELECTED  OFFICIAL. SO THIS POTENTIALLY COULD BE ONE OF THOSE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST  THAT WE'VE TALKED SO MUCH ABOUT  LATER ON. THERE'S ALREADY BEEN AN  ORGANIZATION WHO FILED A  COMPLAINT ABOUT THE PRESIDENT  NOW BEING AN OWNER OR HIS  ORGANIZATION OWNING THIS  PARTICULAR HOTEL. BUT RIGHT NOW THIS COULD BE THE  SCENE OF THE VERY FIRST WALK FOR THE PRESIDENT AND THE NEW FIRST  LADY. THESE EMPLOYEES ARE OUT FRONT. THEY HAVE BEEN ANTICIPATING  SOMETHING. IT'S BEEN VERY QUIET THROUGHOUT  THE DAY AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN WE SAW THESE PEOPLE WALK OUT. THERE ARE ABOUT 260 ROOMS HERE. THE PRESIDENT HAS VISITED NOW  TWICE. THURSDAY NIGHT WAS HIS LATEST  VISIT. THIS COULD ACTUALLY BE THE  SECOND MOST POPULAR PLACE FOR  HIM OUTSIDE OF THE WHITE HOUSE. IT HAPPENS TO, JUST FOR  HISTORICAL PURPOSES, TWICE NOW  BEEN THE TARGET OF DEMOLITION. IT DID NOT COME DOWN. 1914 IS WHEN IT WAS BUILT. IT WAS THE MAIN POST OFFICE FOR  WASHINGTON, D.C. TRUMP TOOK IT OVER. HE SAID IT WAS UNDERBUDGET, THE  RENOVATION PROJECT ITSELF. HERE WE ARE NOW, THIS COULD BE  THE VERY SPOT WHERE HE GETS OUT. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, LESTER, COULD HE HAVE IMAGINED WHEN HE  TOOK ON THIS PROJECT THAT THIS  TIME HE WOULD BE WALKING PAST OR DRIVING PAST IT ON HIS WAY TO  HIS NEW HOME AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. IT IS REMARKABLE AND A PART OF  WHAT WE'VE DISCUSSED FOR 18  MONTHS. >> YEAH, CERTAINLY A SYMBOL OF  HIS SUCCESS AS A BUSINESSPERSON, BUT AS YOU POINT OUT IT MAY BE  ANOTHER COMPLICATION AS HE TRIES TO SEPARATE HIS BUSINESS  INTERESTS FROM HIS JOB AS  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THERE'S A LOT TO EXPLORE. WE DO EXPECT TO SEE THE  PRESIDENT AGAIN SHORTLY. HE'LL BE REVIEWING THE TROOPS  OUTSIDE THE CAPITOL BEFORE THE  INAUGURATION PARADE BEGINS. THEY ARE RUNNING A LITTLE BIT  LATE IN THAT LUNCHEON. THE CAMERAS MAY COME IN AND WE  MAY SEE SOME OF THE END OF THAT  PROGRAM SHORTLY. LET US TAKE A QUICK BREAK. THIS IS NBC NEWS COVERAGE OF THE TRUMP'S NEXT APPEARANCE AT THE  CAPITOL AHEAD OF THE  >> I THINK YOU'RE ALWAYS A  LITTLE NERVOUS BEFORE THAT MANY  PEOPLE BUT IT'S A GREAT  OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO PRAY  AND TO READ GOD'S WORD, SO I WAS THANKFUL FOR THE PRIVILEGE. A GREAT PRIVILEGE.  >> YOU HAVE BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF  THIS PRESIDENT, EVEN DURING SOME OF HIS MORE CHALLENGING TIMES. TALK TO ME ABOUT THE SPEECH AND  HOW DO YOU THINK IT WILL  RESONATE NOT ONLY AMONG THOSE  WHO HAVE SUPPORTED HIM, LIKE  YOURSELF, BUT THOSE WHO HAVE  NOT.  >> FIRST OF ALL, I'M NOT ENDORSE ANY CANDIDATE IN THIS ELECTION. I WENT TO ALL 50 STATE CAPITOLS  AND HELD PRAYER RALLIES ON ALL  50 STATE GROUNDS ON THE CAPITOL  STEPS AND THAT'S WHAT I TRIED TO DO THIS YEAR, TO GET PEOPLE TO  PRAY. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE  JOINED ME TO PRAY FOR THIS  NATION. YOU KNOW, WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HIS SPEECH, HE'S THE PRESIDENT,  WHETHER YOU VOTED FOR HIM OR  NOT, AND HE'S GOING TO BE THE  PRESIDENT FOR THE NEXT FOUR  YEARS. AMERICA NEEDS TO COME TOGETHER. DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN SAYING THE SAME THING SINCE HE FIRST  ENTERED THE RACE. HE HASN'T BACKED UP, HE HASN'T  CHANGED -- HE'S NOT A  POLITICIAN. HE'S SAYING WHAT HE WANTS TO DO. >> IS THAT WHY HE'S HERE,  BECAUSE HE'S NOT A POLITICIAN? >> HE'S NOT A POLITICIAN, JUST  LOOK AT HIM. HE'S A BUSINESSMAN AND HE GETS  HIMSELF IN TROUBLE BY SAYING  THINGS THAT'S IN HIS HEART OR ON HIS MIND. SOMETIMES HE OFFENDS PEOPLE. I DON'T THINK HE TRIES TO DO IT, I THINK HE'S JUST HONEST. IT'S REFRESHING IN SOME WAYS TO  SEE SOMEBODY WHO'S HONEST, WHO  SAYS WHAT HE THINKS AND WHAT  HE'S GOING TO DO. AND IF HE CAN DO HALF OF WHAT HE SAYS HE'S GOING TO DO, HE MIGHT  GO DOWN AS THE GREATEST  PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY.  >> WE SHOWED THERE ARE  PROTESTERS ON THE STREETS HERE. MOST OF THEM HAVE THE BEST OF  INTENTIONS BUT SOME OF THEM HAVE GOTTEN OUT OF HAND AND ARE  THROWING OBJECTS AND LIGHTING  FIRES. HOW DOES HE -- HOW DOES HE SPEAK TO THE SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION THAT JUST FEELS UNCOMFORTABLE  AND AFRAID? WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE HIM? AND IS THERE SOMETHING HE COULD  HAVE SAID TODAY THAT MIGHT HAVE  GONE A LONG WAY? >> WELL, WE CAN ALWAYS NITPICK  HIS SPEECH AND I'M SURE HE DOES  THAT HIMSELF. HE'LL PROBABLY SAY I WISH I SAID THAT OR BEEN A LITTLE MORE  GRACIOUS TO THIS PERSON OR THAT  PERSON. THERE'S A SEGMENT OF THIS  COUNTRY, NO QUESTION, THAT'S  VERY UNHAPPY. THEY LOST. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE  TODAY WITH THE MILLENIALS,  EVERYBODY GETS A TROPHY. YOU PLAY SOCCER, EVEN THE LOSERS GET TROPHIES. PEOPLE ARE NOT USED TO LOSING. SO YOU HAD PEOPLE, THE  DEMOCRATIC PARTY LOST. OKAY, GET OVER IT AND SHARPEN  YOUR MESSAGE UP AND RUN FOUR  YEARS FROM NOW AND WIN. BUT WE GOT TO COME TOGETHER FOR  THE NEXT FOUR YEARS. IF WE DON'T, WE'RE NOT GOING TO  MAKE IT AS A COUNTRY. WE CAN'T CONTINUE LIKE THIS. DONALD TRUMP DID NOT DIVIDE  AMERICA. IT'S BEEN DIVIDED FOR SOME TIME. SO I THINK IT GOES BACK TO  WATERGATE WHEN WE BEGIN TO SEE  THE DIVISION COME INTO OUR  POLITICS. SO I'M GLAD TO SEE DONALD TRUMP  SAY WHAT HE HAS SAID. I HOPE HE CAN DO IT. I'M GOING TO PRAY THAT HE CAN DO IT. IF HE CAN'T, WE'LL ALL BE  LOSERS.  >> REVEREND, HOW DO YOU SQUARE  THE MORALITY QUESTION HERE? THERE HAVE BEEN SOME FOLKS THAT  ARE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH SOME OF  THE PERSONAL BEHAVIORS OR  PERSONAL THINGS THAT DONALD  TRUMP HAS SAID, FEARING THAT  THAT'S NOT A PROPER ROLE MODEL. AS A MAN OF FAITH, HOW DO YOU  SQUARE IT? >> WELL, PRESIDENT CLINTON WAS  SITTING RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME AND HE WASN'T MUCH OF A ROLE MODEL  IN THAT AREA EITHER. BUT HE WAS OUR PRESIDENT,  REGARDLESS. OUR PRESIDENTS ARE HUMAN BEINGS, AND THEY -- THEY HAVE THEIR  WEAKNESSES AND THEY HAVE THEIR  STRENGTHS. WE JUST NEED TO PRAY THAT DONALD TRUMP WILL DO WELL. BECAUSE IF HE DOES WELL, WE'LL  ALL DO WELL AS A NATION.  >> YOU SAID YOU THINK HE REGRETS AND MAYBE GOES BACK AND SAYS I  WISH I'D BEEN MORE GRACIOUS. HAVE YOU EVER HEARD HIM DESCRIBE THAT PRIVATELY? YOU KNOW HIM. HAVE YOU EVER HEARD HIM EXPRESS  REGRET FOR BEING GRACIOUS? >> NO. I'M JUST SAYING FOR ME AS A  SPEAKER --  >> BUT YOU'RE ALWAYS GRACIOUS. >> THANK YOU. BUT I THINK PEOPLE ALWAYS, ANY  OF US FROM TIME TO TIME --  >> DONALD TRUMP YOU THINK  REGRETS NOT BEING GRACIOUS? >> NO. I'M JUST SAYING HE MAY HAVE  SOMETHING IN HIS MIND, WISH HE  HAD DONE THIS OR DONE THAT  BECAUSE WE ALL ARE LIKE THAT. BUT I THINK DONALD TRUMP IS WHO  HE IS. WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET. >> REVEREND GRAHAM, I WAS STRUCK BY TWO THINGS. FIRST OF ALL, WHEN WE HAD  REPRESENTATIVE OF A FAITH AT THE PODIUM OFFERING PRAYERS BEFORE  AND AFTER, IT WAS VERY  ECUMENICAL, EVERYBODY GOT  TOGETHER. DONALD TRUMP IN HIS SPEECH IT  SEEMED TO ME AT LEAST DIDN'T  REACH OUT DELIBERATELY TO OTHER  GROUPS AND SAY I KNOW SOME OF  YOU DIDN'T VOTE FOR ME, BUT I'M  HERE TO HELP YOU AS WELL AS THE  PEOPLE I HAVE BEEN REPRESENTING. COULD HE HAVE BEEN MORE  ECUMENNICAL AND WOULD THAT HAVE  BEEN MORE EFFECTIVE, DO YOU  THINK? >> I DON'T KNOW. I'M SURE HE COULD HAVE. AT THE SAME TIME, I THINK HE  GAVE A VISION FOR AMERICA AND  THAT'S WHAT AMERICA NEEDS RIGHT  NOW, WE NEED A VISION FOR THE  FUTURE, WHERE WE'RE GOING, WHAT  WE'RE GOING TO DO. HE CERTAINLY LAID THAT OUT. HE'S GOING TO BUILD THE  MILITARY, HE'S GOING TO PUT A  LOT OF MONEY INTO THE  INFRASTRUCTURE. WE'RE GOING TO PUT AMERICA  FIRST, WE'RE GOING TO PUT  AMERICAN JOBS FIRST. WHEN YOU THINK OF WHAT HAPPENED  WITH -- IT STARTED WITH BILL  CLINTON AND THE BUSHES AFTER  HIM, WITH NAFTA AND TAKING OUR  BUSINESS OVERSEAS, IT HAS DONE  GREAT HARM TO THIS NATION. DONALD TRUMP HAS SAID WE'RE  GOING TO PUT A STOP TO THIS. I LIVE IN NORTH CAROLINA WHERE  WE HAD THE TEXAS TILL INDUSTRY. TO SEE ALL THOSE TEXTILE MILLS  CLOSED. PEOPLE SAY, WELL, THEY'LL GET  RETRAINED. THEY DON'T WANT TO BE RETRAINED. THEIR FATHERS WORKED IN THOSE  MILLS, THEIR GRANDFATHERS, AND  THEY WERE PROUD OF THE PRODUCTS  THAT THEY MADE. JUST LIKE THE COAL MINERS. COAL MINERS DON'T WANT TO BE A  COMPUTER PROGRAMMER. NOTHING AGAINST COMPUTER  PROGRAMMERS, I DON'T WANT TO GET THEM MAD AT ME, BUT THEY WANT TO WORK IN THE COAL MINES BECAUSE  THAT'S WHERE THEY GREW UP IN  THEIR FAMILIES, THAT'S THEIR  HERITAGE, AND THEY'RE PROUD TO  BE CALLED MINERS. AT SOME POINT THE DEMOCRATIC  PARTY LOST TOUCH WITH THESE  CONSTITUENTS IN AMERICA. DONALD TRUMP CONNECTED WITH  THEM. WHEN I WENT TO ALL 50 STATE  CAPITOLS TO HOLD THESE PRAYER  RALLIES, I COULD SEE THESE WERE  WORKING PEOPLE THAT CAME OUT IN  THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY WITHOUT  JOBS. THEY WERE WANTING SOMEONE TO  SPEAK UP FOR THEM BECAUSE THEIR  PARTY WAS NOT SPEAKING UP FOR  THEM ANYMORE.  >> REVEREND GRAHAM, GREAT TO  HAVE YOU HERE. THANKS SO MUCH FOR TAKING THE  TIME.  >> GOD BLESS YOU ALL.  >> ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU.  >> THANK YOU.  >>> WE ARE KEEPING A VERY CLOSE  EYE ON CAPITOL HILL RIGHT NOW  WHERE I THINK THEY'RE ABOUT TO  TURN THE CAMERAS BACK ON IN THE  LUNCHEON HONORING PRESIDENT  TRUMP AND HIS FAMILY. IN FACT THEY HAVE. THERE'S A LIVE VIEW. >> WE CAN'T LET THE FIRST LADY  AND THE PRESIDENT LEAVE UNTIL WE RECOGNIZE THEM WITH A FEW TOKENS AND MEMENTOS OF THE DAY. I'M CERTAINLY PLEASED THAT THE  HOUSE LEADERS, CONGRESSMAN  PELOSI AND CONGRESSMAN McCARTHY  ARE HERE TO MAKE THAT FIRST  PRESENTATION. >> MR. PRESIDENT, MR. VICE  PRESIDENT, IT IS ONLY FITTING  THAT OUR FIRST MEAL IS HERE IN  STATUARY HALL, BECAUSE THIS IS  THE VERY FIRST CHAMBERS WHEN IT  CAME TO CONGRESS. IT IS TO ME MY FAVORITE ROOM. BECAUSE SITTING RIGHT BACK OVER  THERE BY FATHER CERA WAS A YOUNG CONGRESSMAN WHO SERVED ONE TERM  WHO I BELIEVE WAS OUR FINEST  PRESIDENT, ABRAHAM LINCOLN. I WILL GIVE TOURS, AND WHEN I  GIVE TOURS, PEOPLE COME THROUGH  AND WE'LL GO AND STAND ON THE  TILE. I'LL TELL THEM TO STAND AT THAT  EXACT SPOT OF HIS DESK AND I  TELL THEM TO LOOK BACK AT THAT  CLOCK AND I TELL THEM TO RECITE  THE TIME. I TELL THEM WHAT TIME THAT WAS. THEY ASK ME WHY. AND I SAID BECAUSE THAT'S THE  EXACT SAME VIEW THAT ABRAHAM  LINCOLN HAD AND I WONDER WHAT  HIS IDEAS AND THOUGHTS WERE. THE CHALLENGES THAT HE HAD AT  THAT TIME WERE THE GREATEST TO  OUR CONSTITUTION EVER IN THE  HISTORY. OUR CHALLENGES TODAY ARE  DIFFERENT, BUT WE STILL HAVE BIG CHALLENGES. SO TODAY WE HAVE A GIFT FOR YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. WHILE YOU WERE BEING SWORN IN,  THE FLAG THAT WAS FLOWN OVER THE U.S. CAPITOL. MR. LINCOLN HAD VERY INSPIRING  WORDS. THE TIMES WERE DIFFERENT, BUT IN HIS ANNUAL MESSAGE TO CONGRESS,  I THOUGHT THESE WORDS MEANT THE  MOST. THE DOGMAS OF THE QUIET PAST OR  INADEQUATE TO THE STORMY  PRESENT. THE OCCASION IS PILED HIGH WITH  DIFFICULTY, AND WE MUST RISE  WITH THE OCCASION. AS OUR CASE IS NEW, WE MUST ACT  ANEW AND THINK ANEW. WE MUST DISENTHRALL OURSELVES  AND THEN WE SHALL SAVE OUR  COUNTRY. MR. PRESIDENT, I WISH YOU THE  BEST OF LUCK. [ APPLAUSE ] >> MR. PRESIDENT AND MADAM FIRST LADY, CONGRATULATIONS ON THE  INAUGURATION. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE PRAY FOR  YOUR FAMILY AND FOR THE SUCCESS  OF YOUR ADMINISTRATION. FOLLOWING UP ON THE HISTORY  THEME THAT MR. BLUNT SO  BEAUTIFULLY STARTED US ON THIS  MORNING AND MR. SCHUMER  CONTINUED AND I FOLLOW, OUR  HOUSE REPUBLICAN LEADER, MR.  McCARTHY, YES, IN THIS ROOM THIS WAS THE ORIGINAL CHAMBER. LINCOLN SAT THERE AND HERE WE  ARE GATHERED TODAY IN THAT OLD  HOUSE CHAMBER WHERE LINCOLN  SERVED BENEATH THE SAME CLOCK  THAT LINCOLN HEARD TICKING, BUT  UNDER THE GAZE OF CLEO. MR. PRESIDENT, RIGHT UP THERE  ABOVE THAT DOOR, THE MUSE OF  HISTORY, CLEO. FOR ALMOST TWO CENTURIES, CLEO  AND HER CLOCK HAVE REMINDED THE  MEN AND WOMEN IN THESE HALLOWED  HALLS THAT WE ARE PART OF  HISTORY, THAT OUR WORDS AND  ACTIONS WILL FACE THE JUDGMENT  OF HISTORY AND THAT WE ARE PART  OF THE LONG AND HONORABLE  HERITAGE OF OUR DEMOCRACY. THAT IS CLEO'S ADVICE. WE COME TO THE SACRED  INAUGURATION DAY UNITED IN  RESPECT FOR OUR DEMOCRACY AND  DETERMINED TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE  IN THE LIVES OF HARD-WORKING  AMERICANS. I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF  PRESENTING A FLAG TO THE VICE  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,  MIKE PENCE. ONE OF THE HOUSE OF  REPRESENTATIVES OWN, RIGHT, MR.  SPEAKER? WE KNOW THAT VICE PRESIDENT  PENCE IS STRENGTHENED BY HIS  FAITH, BY HIS FAMILY AND BY THE  FOUNDATION OF EXPERIENCE HE  BUILT HERE IN THESE HALLS. I TOLD HIM, MR. PRESIDENT, HE  KNOWS THE TERRITORY. HE KNOWS THE TERRITORY. IT IS NOW MY HONOR TO PRESENT  ONE OF THE FLAGS THAT FLEW ABOVE THE CAPITOL TODAY TO THE VICE  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,  MIKE PENCE. WE PRAY FOR YOU, FOR YOUR  BELOVED WIFE, KAREN, FOR  MICHAEL, CHARLOTTE AND AUDREY  AND ALL OF YOUR FAMILY. GOD BLESS YOU, MR. VICE  PRESIDENT. REMEMBERING THAT THIS FLAG THAT  WE PLEDGE TO EVERY DAY FOR  LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL IS  OUR CALLING. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH  YOU. NOW IT'S MY HONOR TO PRESENT YOU WITH THIS FLAG. >> WELL, THOSE OF US WHO SERVED  IN THE HOUSE OR STILL SERVE IN  THE HOUSE THINK THE SENATE IS  NEVER QUITE AS QUICK AS THE  HOUSE, BUT MAYBE WHEN IT COMES  TO PHOTOGRAPHS WE ARE. MY GOOD FRIEND, CHUCK SCHUMER,  IS GOING TO COME AND MAKE THAT  PRESENTATION. >> WELL, THANK YOU, ROY. FIRST, LET'S HAVE A HAND FOR  ROY. HE DID A GREAT JOB, HE AND HIS  STAFF, ON THIS INAUGURATION. [ APPLAUSE ] NOW, MR. PRESIDENT, EARLIER THIS YEAR IRIS AND I WERE TRULY  BLESSED. WE WATCHED OUR OLDER DAUGHTER,  JESSICA, MARRY THE BOY OF HER  DREAMS. WE ARE SO HAPPY. THAT'S WHEN I LEARNED, THOUGH,  THAT NOTHING IS OFFICIAL UNTIL  THERE'S A PHOTO OF IT. SO, MR. PRESIDENT, NOW IT'S  OFFICIAL. I PRESENT TO YOU THE PHOTOGRAPH  OF YOUR INAUGURATION. [ APPLAUSE ] >> SO, MR. PRESIDENT AND MR.  VICE PRESIDENT AND MRS. TRUMP  AND MRS. PENCE, A GIFT THAT  YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A CHANCE TO LOOK AT MORE LATER AND A LOT  MORE OVER THE YEARS IS SOMETHING THAT REALLY A TRADITION STARTED, NOW THIS IS THE EIGHTH  INAUGURATION WHERE THE LENOX  COMPANY HAS MADE A SPECIAL  PRESENTATION OF A GIFT MADE  UNIQUELY FOR EACH OF YOU AND  UNIQUELY FOR THIS EVENT. THIS YEAR THE COMPANY PROPOSED  AND THE COMMITTEE DETERMINED  THAT THE BOWL THEY HAD IN MIND  WAS SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD  VALUE FOR A LONG TIME. THE ONE THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS  AND THE FIRST LADY HAS IS AN  ETCHING OF THE WHITE HOUSE  LOOKING ACROSS, DIRECTLY ACROSS  AT THE JEFFERSON MEMORIAL. AND THE ONE THAT THE PENCES WILL BE PRESENTED WITH AND HAVE AT  THEIR HOME WOULD BE THE CAPITOL  LOOKING DOWN AT THE LINCOLN  MEMORIAL. THE ARTIST WHO WAS WITH US THE  OTHER DAY TALKED ABOUT TRYING TO CAPTURE LA FONT'S DESIGN FOR THE CITY AS WELL AS HOW THIS CITY  CAME TOGETHER. TIMOTHY CARTER WAS THE DESIGNER. THE GLASS MASTER, PETER O'RORK,  MADE THESE. THEY ALSO HAVE A COMPASS IN THE  BOTTOM OF THEM, OR AN ETCHED-IN  COMPASS, AND REMEMBERING, MR.  PRESIDENT, AS THE VICE PRESIDENT ALREADY KNOWS, THAT THE CENTER  OF WASHINGTON IS NOT AT THE  WHITE HOUSE, IT'S ACTUALLY RIGHT HERE IN THE CENTER OF THE  CAPITOL BUILDING. THE CITY IS THEN LAID OUT  NORTHWEST, NORTHEAST, SOUTHWEST, SOUTHEAST, FROM THAT PLACE. THE OTHER -- THE OTHER UNIQUE  THING -- THE OTHER UNIQUE THING  FOR THE FIRST LADY AND HER  PARENTS THAT WOULD NEVER HAVE  BEEN SUCH AN IMPORTANT THING  BEFORE, THE GLASS CAME FROM  SLOVENIA. [ APPLAUSE ] THE DESIGNER THOUGHT THAT THE  BEST GLASS IN THE WORLD FOR THIS PARTICULAR DESIGN WHICH HE BEGAN TO WORK ON LAST SUMMER WAS GLASS FROM SLOVENIA. MAYBE HE KNEW SOMETHING THAT  NONE OF US QUITE KNEW FOR SURE  AT THAT TIME. I'D NOW LIKE TO HAVE THE TOAST  TO THE VICE PRESIDENT AND THE  PRESIDENT. THE SPEAKER AND I BOTH SERVED  WITH MIKE PENCE, SO IT WAS A  CHALLENGE FOR ME TO GIVE UP THIS MOMENT, BUT MIKE PENCE, A MAN OF THE HOUSE, THE SPEAKER OF THE  HOUSE WILL BRING THAT TOAST, AND THEN THE MAJORITY LEADER WILL  COME AND TOAST TO THE PRESIDENT. MR. PRESIDENT, IF YOU HAVE  ANYTHING TO SAY AT THE END OF  THOSE REMARKS, I'D ALSO LIKE TO  SAY SO I DON'T FORGET TO DO IT,  THANKS SO MUCH TO THE STAFF THAT MADE ALL THIS EFFORT HAPPEN  TODAY. [ APPLAUSE ] STACY McBRIDE, THE STAFF  DIRECTOR OF THE RULES COMMITTEE  AND THE STAFF DIRECTOR FOR THE  JOINT COMMITTEE ON THE  INAUGURATION, MARIA LOHMEYER WHO CAME ON BOARD TO DO THIS. HER LAST EVENT WAS THE POPE'S  VISIT, SO THAT JUST GOT HER  READY FOR YOUR VISIT. THE GREAT WORK OF THE CAPITOL  POLICE, THE SERGEANT AT ARMS OF  THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE, THE  COOPERATIVE EFFORT OF THE D.C.  POLICE. OUR GOAL TODAY WAS FOR THIS  EVENT TO BE AN EVENT WHERE  PEOPLE CAME AND WHEN THEY LEFT  THE EVENT OUTSIDE, THEY FELT  LIKE THEY HAD ALL THE FREEDOM  THAT YOU COULD POSSIBLY HAVE AND STILL HAVE ALL THE SECURITY YOU  NEEDED. I HOPE PEOPLE LEFT FEELING THAT  WAY. IF THEY DID, IT WAS THE GREAT  WORK OF SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE. MR. SPEAKER. >> THANK YOU, ROY. THIS IS A GREAT HONOR AND  PRIVILEGE, TO TOAST MY DEAR  FRIEND AND FORMER COLLEAGUE,  VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE. I JUST REALLY ENJOY SAYING THAT. I THINK ABOUT THE TIMES THAT  WE'VE WALKED BACK AND FORTH JUST DOWN THIS HALL ON THE WAY TO A  VOTE. BUT IF MEMORY SERVES, MORE OFTEN THAN NOT, WE WALKED THAT WAY  BECAUSE WE WERE BEING HAULED  INTO THE SPEAKER'S OFFICE FOR  BEING ADMONISHED FOR BEING  RABBLE ROUSERS IN THE REPUBLICAN STUDY COMMITTEE. WE'VE HAD SO MANY GREAT MEMORIES HERE. I KNOW THIS JOB MAKES YOU AN  OFFICER OF THE SENATE, BUT YOU,  MIKE PENCE, WILL ALWAYS BE A  PART OF THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE. [ APPLAUSE ] WE TALK ABOUT OUR TWO BODIES  QUITE A BIT, AND IF I HAD TO USE A SPORTS ANALOGY, I WOULD SAY WE PLAY RUGBY, THEY PLAY GOLF. JUST SAYING. I'M REMINDED OF SOMETHING,  THOUGH, THAT I THINK IS PRETTY  PROFOUND. THAT MAKES ME THINK OF MIKE  PENCE. I'M REMINDED OF THE WORDS OF  MIKE'S FAVORITE AUTHOR, MARK  HALPERIN. AS LONG AS YOU HAVE LIFE AND  BREATH, BELIEVE. AS LONG AS YOU HAVE LIFE AND  BREATH, BELIEVE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THERE WAS  NO ONE THAT I HAVE SERVED WITH  WHO BRINGS MORE BELIEF TO HIS  WORK THAN MIKE PENCE. NO ONE BELIEVES MORE DEEPLY IN  OUR COUNTRY AND HER PEOPLE, NO  ONE BELIEVES MORE DEEPLY IN OUR  CAPACITY TO DO GREAT THINGS. HE IS A HAPPY WARRIOR. THE PRESIDENT COULD NOT HAVE  CHOSEN A BETTER PARTNER FOR THIS WORK THAN MIKE PENCE. SO, MR. PRESIDENT, MR. VICE  PRESIDENT, WE RAISE OUR GLASSES  TO YOU, TO KAREN AND TO YOUR  BEAUTIFUL FAMILY. MAY YOU HAVE EVERY BLESSING AND  SUCCESS AS THE 48th VICE  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  OF AMERICA. >> WELL, THE THEME OF TODAY'S  INAUGURATION IS UNIQUELY  AMERICA. THERE ARE SOME WORDS THAT COME  TO MIND WHEN YOU HEAR THAT  PHRASE. BIG, BOLD, ENERGETIC,  ENTERPRISING, AND RESILIENT. ALWAYS LOOKING TO THE NEXT  HORIZON. IT SURE SOUNDS LIKE OUR COUNTRY  AND IT SURE SOUNDS LIKE DONALD  TRUMP. [ APPLAUSE ] OUR PRESIDENT HAS SURMOUNTED  FORMIDABLE CHALLENGES GETTING TO THIS MOMENT. HE'S BEEN UNDERESTIMATED OFTEN  BUT HE NEVER LET IT STOP HIM  FROM SUCCEEDING. WE'RE WISHING HIM SIMILAR  SUCCESS AS HE TURNS TO THE  CHARGE OF GOVERNING. WE FACE MANY CHALLENGES BUT  WE'VE EMERGED STRONGER. SOME THINGS ENDURE AND WE  CELEBRATE ONE OF THEM TODAY. THIS INAUGURATION IS A REMINDER  OF OUR COMMON STORY AS  AMERICANS, AND ON THIS MOST  UNIQUELY AMERICAN OF OCCASIONS,  I ASK YOU TO STAND AND JOIN ME  IN RAISING A GLASS. MR. PRESIDENT, MAY YOU FIND  EVERY SUCCESS IN THE YEARS  AHEAD. MAY YOU UNITE OUR COUNTRY BEHIND A COMMON VISION AND RENEW THE  PROMISE THAT MAKES OUR COUNTRY  SO GREAT. HEAR, HEAR. . .  >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MITCH,  AND PAUL AND OUR GREAT VICE  PRESIDENT. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WANTS TO  SO WE'LL CUT IT SHORT. BUT WE HAVE SO MANY OF OUR  CABINET MEMBERS HERE. I SEE MY GENERALS THAT ARE GOING TO KEEP US SO SAFE. THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF  PROBLEMS, THE OTHER SIDE. THEY'RE GOING TO LOOK AT A  COUPLE OF THEM. IF I'M DOING A MOVIE, I PICK  YOU, GENERAL. GENERAL MATTIS IS DOING REALLY  WELL. EVEN CHUCK LIKES GENERAL MATTIS  AND GENERAL KELLY. WE HAD A VERY INTERESTING TALK. KIDDINGLY, HE THINKS WE'RE DOING GREAT AT THE CABINET LEVEL, BUT  WE'RE GOING TO DO JUST FINE. WE'RE GOING TO DO JUST FINE. I TELL YOU, THERE IS SOMETHING  THAT I WANTED TO SAY, BECAUSE I  WAS VERY HONORED, VERY, VERY  HONORED WHEN I HEARD THAT  PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON AND  SECRETARY HILLARY CLINTON WAS  COMING TODAY, AND I THINK IT'S  APPROPRIATE TO SAY, AND I'D LIKE YOU TO STAND UP. I'D LIKE YOU TO STAND UP. AND HONESTLY, THERE IS NOTHING  MORE I CAN SAY BECAUSE I HAVE A  LOT OF RESPECT FOR THOSE TWO  PEOPLE. SO THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE, AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE FOUR  GREAT YEARS, HOPEFULLY OF PEACE  AND PROSPERITY. I WILL BE WORKING VERY, VERY  HARD. OUR CABINET IS LINED UP AND  READY. I KNOW EVENTUALLY CHUCK IS GOING TO APPROVE THEM, I'M SURE. I REALLY BELIEVE THAT. WE'RE ALL DEALING TOGETHER, WE  ALL WANT THE SAME THING. WHETHER YOU'RE REPUBLICAN OR  DEMOCRAT, IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY  DIFFERENCE. WE'RE GOING TO GET ALONG. AGAIN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IT'S AN HONOR, AND ROY, YOU HAVE DONE A SPECTACULAR JOB. YOU AND TOM BARRETT. I WANT TO THANK YOU. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> TWO QUICK FINAL THINGS. TWO QUICK FINAL THINGS. YOU CAN REMAIN STANDING IF YOU  WANT TO. TWO THINGS WE NEED TO DO AS WE  LEAVE. ONE, JUST TO MENTION THE GIFTS,  THE MEMENTOS OF THIS EVENT. THERE IS SOME NOTE CARDS AND A  REALLY GREAT BOX PUT TOGETHER BY THE GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE,  BUT THE NOTE CARDS REPRESENTING  ALL THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT AND IDENTIFIED WITH THIS EVENT  THIS DAY WERE DONE BY ST. LOUIS  ARTISTS, A FRIEND OF MINE, ED  FISHER. >> WE'RE WATCHING THE END OF A  LUNCHEON IN HONOR OF PRESIDENT  TRUMP. HE WILL GO INTO A HOLDING AREA  AND WE'LL SEE HIM EMERGE  SHORTLY. WE JUST OBSERVED ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE MOMENTS OF THE DAY,  SOMETHING HE DID NOT DO IN HIS  SPEECH. PRESIDENT TRUMP ACKNOWLEDGED  HILLARY CLINTON AND PRESIDENT  CLINTON WHO WERE IN THE ROOM AND INVITED THE AUDIENCE TO STAND  FOR A LONG ROUND OF APPLAUSE AND SAID HE HAS RESPECT FOR THESE  TWO PEOPLE. NOT QUITE THE EMBRACE WHEN THEY  SHOOK HANDS AT THE BEGINNING OF  THIS EVENT, BUT THAT WAS THE  FIRST ACKNOWLEDGMENT. >> WE GIVE THANKS TO YOU, OH  LORD, FOR THE MEAL WE HAVE  SHARED AND TO THOSE WHO HAVE  WORKED HARD TO PREPARE AND  DELIVER IT TO US. MAY WE ALWAYS BE GRATEFUL FOR  THE KINDNESSES WE RECEIVE. WE THANK YOU AS WELL FOR THE  CELEBRATION OF THIS DAY WHEN OUR NATION ONCE AGAIN MODELS FOR THE WORLD THE GREATNESS OF PEACEFUL  TRANSITION OF POWER. WE ASK A SPECIAL BLESSING UPON  OUR NEW PRESIDENT, DONALD TRUMP. GIVE HIM AN UNDERSTANDING HEART  TO DISCERN BETWEEN GOOD AND  EVIL. MAY HE BE STRENGTHENED IN HIS  WORK AND GROW IN UNDERSTANDING  AS HE PROVES EVER ATTENTIVE TO  THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE PRAY THAT HE MIGHT BECOME HIS BEST SELF. BLESS AS WELL ALL THOSE WHO ARE  IN PLACE TO EXERCISE POWER IN  OUR NATION. SAVE THEM FROM SEEKING THOSE  THINGS ESCHEWED BY SOLOMON. LONG LIFE, RICHES FOR SELF AND  THE LIVES OF ENEMIES AND IMPEL  THEM TO SEEK THE GIFT OF  DISCERNMENT SO AS TO UNDERSTAND  JUSTICE. LORD, MAY THE PEOPLE OF THIS  NATION STAND WITH OUR PRESIDENT  AND ALL OUR LEADERS TO FACE ANY  CHALLENGE, ENDURE ANY DIFFICULTY WITHOUT FEAR, LEARN HOW TO  ACCEPT EVERY SUCCESS AND EVERY  FAILURE WITH GRACE AND SUPPORT  OUR PRESIDENT AND LEADERS WITH  ENCOURAGEMENT AND PRAYER. AS WE MOVE FORWARD THIS DAY AND  THROUGH ALL DAYS, MAY ALL THAT  IS DONE BE FOR YOUR GREATER  HONOR AND GLORY. AMEN. >> Announcer: LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN, PLEASE REMAIN AT YOUR SEATS AS PRESIDENT TRUMP, VICE  PRESIDENT PENCE, THE JOINT  CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE ON  INAUGURAL CEREMONIES AND THE  OFFICIAL PARTY DEPART. >> AS WE WATCH THEM MAKE THEIR  EXIT, LET ME BRING BACK NICOLE  ANSHUK ON THIS. I'M CURIOUS, AS WE NOTED, HE  CALLED FOR AN OVATION FOR  HILLARY CLINTON. HE TOOK KIND OF A BEATING ON  SOCIAL MEDIA FOR NOT MENTIONING  HER EARLIER. >> YES. ABSOLUTELY. IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT HE DID IT. IT WAS, I THINK, AN OMISSION  DURING THE INAUGURAL, A MISSED  OPPORTUNITY. BUT YES, I THINK HE DID AS BEST  HE COULD TO MAKE UP FOR WHAT I  THINK WAS AN OMISSION AT THE  TIME. >> HE'S A GUY WHO IS ALWAYS  SCREWING THE WINGS ON AT 50,000  FEET, AND THIS IS WHAT HIS  SUPPORTERS GET AND HIS  DETRACTORS DON'T. HE MAY HAVE CHECKED TWITTER, HE  MAY HAVE ASKED SOMEONE, HOW IS  THE COVERAGE, BECAUSE HE'S  DEEPLY INTERESTED IN HOW  EVERYTHING HE DOES AND SAYS IS  RECEIVED. BUT I THINK THE WARMTH IS  GENUINE. THEY KNOW EACH OTHER. >> THERE WAS CLEARLY A DECISION  NOT TO INCLUDE IT IN THE  ORIGINAL SPEECH. >> CLEARLY. YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE IT CAME UP,  BUT MAYBE HE DIDN'T FOCUS ON IT. SO AS THE DAY ROLLED ON, MAYBE  HE'S FEELING GOOD, MAYBE HE'S  FEELING, YOU KNOW, WOW, IT  REALLY IS NICE. I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD HAVE  DONE IT. WHO KNOWS WHAT WENT THROUGH HIS  MIND. BUT IT IS A GENUINE MOMENT. >> THAT'S THE THING ABOUT IT,  THAT SEEMED VERY GENUINE. THAT IS THE DONALD TRUMP THAT  MANY OF US HAVE SPOKEN WITH  BEHIND THE SCENES, THAT HAS THIS SORT OF, YOU KNOW -- HE CAN BE  IN A GOOD MOOD, ENTHUSIASTIC,  UPBEAT, AND THAT'S WHAT HE  SOUNDED LIKE THERE TALKING ABOUT THE CLINTONS. >> I'M NOT SO SURE I AGREE WITH  YOU. WITH THE BIG SPEECH HE WANTED TO SOLIDIFY AND REACH OUT TO HIS  CONSTITUENCY AND SEND A SIGNAL. THIS IS WHO I AM AND GET READY. AND THEN WHEN HE CAME IN HERE,  THIS WAS A MUCH SMALLER MOMENT,  AND THAT SPEECH WAS, FRANKLY,  AND HE WAS ABLE TO PAY TRIBUTE  TO THEM WHICH I THINK WAS  GENUINE. THEY WENT TO HIS WEDDING. HE GAVE MONEY TO THE CAMPAIGN  WHEN HE WAS A DEMOCRAT. HE'S KNOWN THEM A LONG, LONG  TIME. I THINK THAT FIRST SPEECH THAT  HE MADE WAS A SPEECH THAT HE  CAME TO THIS TOWN INTENDING TO  GIVE. AND BASED ON THE MOFs, THE WORD  ON THE STREETS, THEY LIKED IT. THAT'S WHAT THEY WANTED FROM  HIM. THAT'S HOW HE GOT THERE. >> I STILL THINK THE BIKERS  WOULD HAVE BEEN OFFENDED IF  THERE HAD BEEN 20 WORDS IN THE  SPEECH THAT SAID, I APPRECIATE  THAT MY OPPONENT WAS HERE. >> UNFORTUNATELY, NOT AS MANY  PEOPLE ARE WATCHING THIS AS --  >> BUT TOM'S POINT IS THAT WAS  BY DESIGN. >> RIGHT, THEY WERE WATCHING THE INAUGURAL, AND IT STILL FEELS  LIKE A MISSED OPPORTUNITY. >> TO NOTE THAT THEY DID SHAKE  HANDS AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS. >> I THINK IN THE INAUGURAL  ADDRESS, HE WAS SENDING A  SIGNAL. THERE IS NOT A DIFFERENT DONALD  TRUMP. I'M THE ONE WHO GOT HERE ON  THESE TERMS AND THESE ARE THE  TERMS IN WHICH I'M GOING TO  GOVERN. >> YOU'RE PUTTING IT IN A  POLITICAL CALCULATION OF SAYING, THIS IS HOW WE'RE GOING TO  GOVERN. WE'RE GOING TO GOVERN IN A  CONFRONTATIONAL WAY. THIS IS GOING TO BE A  CONFRONTATIONAL ADMINISTRATION  BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE --  THAT'S THE MESSAGE, THAT'S THE  MANDATE THEY BELIEVE THEY GOT. GET OUT THERE AND GET 'EM. >> HE LIVES FOR THE CONSTANT  FEEDBACK MOVE, AND I THINK IT'S  ALSO POSSIBLE HE HEARD SOME OF  THE FEEDBACK WAS THAT HE HADN'T  BEEN PARTICULARLY GRACIOUS TO  THEM, THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO BE  THERE. I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE HE HEARD  THAT AND THOUGHT, OH, I AM GLAD  THEY'RE HERE, SO LET ME GET UP  AND SAY SO. >> THAT PIECE OF IT COULD BE  TRUE, I'M JUST SAYING ABOUT THE  SPEECH, THAT HE KNEW WHERE HE  WANTED TO GO AND HOW TO GET  THERE AND HE DIDN'T WANT TO  DIMINISH THE CENTRALITY OF HIS  MESSAGE. >> THERE'S FORMER PRESIDENT DAN  QUAYLE. >> TALKING TO DAN PRICE. >> IT LOOKS LIKE TIFFANY TRUMP  AND DONALD JR. >> YOU GET TO SEE THE THICKNESS  OF THE DOORS. LOOK AT THE THICKNESS. IT'S AN INTERESTING SHOT. >> HERMETICALLY SEALED. >> IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S A VAULT. >> SOMETHING OUT OF ""GET SMART""  WITH THE CONE OF SILENCE. UP TO THIS POINT HE'S BEEN  RIDING AROUND IN AN ARMORED SUV, BUT THE FIRST FAMILY WILL BE IN  THESE PRESIDENTIAL LIMOUSINES  FOR THE TRIP BACK. I DON'T KNOW, OBVIOUSLY THE  PRESIDENT AND FIRST LADY WILL BE RIDING FOR MOST OF THE JOURNEY  ALONG PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE AND  THEY'LL GO TO THE WHITE HOUSE  AND THEN COME BACK OUT TO THE  REVIEWING STAND. BUT THE PARADE WILL BE GETTING  UNDER WAY HERE QUITE SHORTLY. THE PRESIDENT RIGHT NOW IN A  HOLDING AREA THERE IN THE  CAPITOL. BUT WHEN THEY GET TO THE WHITE  HOUSE THIS TIME, IT WILL BE FOR  GOOD, FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS,  AT LEAST, AS THE NEW FIRST  FAMILY. WERE YOU GOING TO SAY SOMETHING, CHUCK? >> NO, I'M JUST WATCHING THE  BEAST. YOU DON'T NORMALLY GET A SHOT  LIKE THAT, I'M TELLING YOU. >> HERE'S THE CLINTONS BACK  THERE. >> THEY HAVE A RESIDENCY HERE AS WELL AS NEW YORK. >> HE GETS SECRET SERVICE  PROTECTION, OR SHE DOES AS WELL. >> AND THERE IS PRESIDENT  CLINTON. IT'S BEEN A DAY FULL OF EMOTION  FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE AND  CERTAINLY THAT COUPLE. >> IN FRONT OF CLINTON'S CHIEF  OF STAFF FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS AS FORMER PRESIDENT. >> WHAT'S IN HILLARY CLINTON'S  FUTURE? >> I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH OF A  PUBLIC FIGURE SHE WANTS TO BE OR IS GOING TO BE. I THINK THAT THAT IS A QUESTION. DOES SHE HAVE ANOTHER BOOK IN  HER? DOES SHE WANT TO? >> WILL SHE BE ACTIVE AS FAR AS  THE PARTY IS CONCERNED? >> HONESTLY, I THINK SHE WILL  BE. WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THERE'S  BEEN A GROWING, BUT STILL QUIET, SENTIMENT AMONG DEMOCRATS WHERE  THEY LOOK AT RUSSIA AND ALL  THESE THINGS, BUT THERE IS MORE  AND MORE OF A RELUCTANT  ACCEPTANCE THAT A LOT OF THIS  LOSS DOES BELONG TO HER. AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, WHAT  LESSON? I THINK THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE  PARTY STILL COMING TO GRIPS WITH THAT. THOSE THAT ARE VERY LOYAL TO THE CLINTONS NOT READY TO FULLY  EMBRACE THAT EXPLANATION BECAUSE OF THE OTHER CLOUDS THAT HANG  OUT THERE. WHAT IT WILL DO IS YOU WILL NOT  SEE A LOT OF DEMOCRATS RIGHT  NOW. >> I THINK THE WOMEN'S MARCH  TOMORROW, THAT'S STILL A CROWD  VERY EAGER TO HAVE HER VOICE  HEARD. I THINK THERE ARE WOMEN WHO  BELIEVE THAT SEXISM PLAYED A  PART. IT'S NOT TO BLAME FOR HER  DEFEAT, BUT IT PLAYED A PART,  THIS SORT OF, YOU KNOW, HIDDEN  DISTRUST OF HER. LOTS OF PEOPLE SAID THAT WHAT  SHE DID WAS WORSE THAN WHAT HE  SAID. A LOT OF WOMEN, LIBERAL WOMEN,  FEMINISTS, PEOPLE WHO CONSIDER  THEMSELVES FEMINISTS, HEAR SOME  SEXISM IN THOSE EXPLANATIONS AND JUSTIFICATIONS, AND I THINK  SHE'LL BE VERY WELCOME IN SORT  OF FIGHTING FOR PLANNED  PARENTHOOD OR FIGHTING TO HELP  REDEFINE FEMINISM OR LENDING HER VOICE TO THOSE CAUSES. IN THOSE CIRCLES, SHE REMAINS  VERY INFLUENTIAL. >> LET ME BRING IN ANITA  MCBRIDE, FORMER ASSISTANT TO  GEORGE W. BUSH AND FIRST LADY  LAURA BUSH. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. >> GOOD TO BE HERE. >> HOW DO YOU FORGET ABOUT THE  FIRST FAMILY? YOU SUDDENLY MOVE INTO THE WHITE HOUSE, THERE'S A FAMOUS ADDRESS. HOW DO YOU DO THIS? >> YOU'VE GOT ONE OF THE MOST  FAMOUS HISTORIANS HERE WHO HAS  RESEARCHED ALL THESE PEOPLE TO  TRY TO EXPLAIN THIS. NOBODY CAN COMPLETELY PREPARE  YOU FOR WALKING INTO SOMETHING  LIKE THAT AND WALKING INTO THE  WHITE HOUSE AND HAVING THESE  EXPECTATIONS THAT EVERYONE HAS  OF YOU ON WHAT YOU SHOULD DO. >> BUT IS THERE A CAREER  EMPLOYEE WHO SITS YOU DOWN AND  SAYS, THIS IS THE WAY IT WORKS,  YOU'RE GOING TO MEET THIS  PERSON, YOU'RE GOING TO MEET  THAT PERSON? >> MY FIRST JOB IN THE WHITE  HOUSE WAS READING RONALD  REAGAN'S MAIL, AND THE WOMAN WHO TAUGHT ME TO READ MAIL AND  ANALYZE IT WAS SOMEONE WHO WAS  HIRED IN THE LAST DAYS OF  FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT. I'LL NEVER FORGET IT. SHE HAD DONE THAT JOB FOR YEARS. BUT THERE IS NO ONE REALLY LIKE  THAT. THAT'S AN OPERATIONAL SIDE OF  THE WHITE HOUSE. THERE IS NO ONE LIKE THAT,  REALLY, ON THE POLITICAL SIDE. I MEAN, THERE IS NO ONE THAT  TOLD YOU WHAT TO DO, YOU JUST -- THERE IS AN EXPECTATION THAT YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT WHAT TO DO. BUT FOR SOMEONE LIKE LAURA BUSH  WHO I WORKED FOR, SHE HAD BEEN  THE FIRST LADY OF A STATE, SO  SHE HAD SOMEWHAT OF A FRAMEWORK. SHE ALSO HAD THE EXAMPLE OF HER  MOTHER-IN-LAW, AND THAT SORT OF  HELPED. SHE WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST PREPARED OF THE FIRST LADIES TO  GO INTO THE WHITE HOUSE. BUT I THINK FOR THIS FAMILY,  THEY'RE NOT ONLY JUST A NEW  FIRST FAMILY, THEY'RE NEW TO  POLITICS ENTIRELY AND HAVE  REALLY NOT LIVED A LIFE IN THE  PUBLIC EYE AS POLITICIANS. SO THIS WILL BE -- IT WILL  DEFINITELY BE DIFFERENT. >> BUT THEY HAD BEEN IN THE  PUBLIC EYE. THAT DOES HELP A LITTLE BIT,  RIGHT? >> IT DOES HELP. >> YOU THINK ABOUT MICHELLE  OBAMA. SHE HADN'T BEEN IN THE PUBLIC  EYE OR EVEN IN THAT WAY, SO THAT MUST HELP SOME. >> DEFINITELY, AND THEY'RE  CERTAINLY USED TO BEING  PHOTOGRAPHED AND CERTAINLY USED  TO BEING FOLLOWED AROUND, AND  YOU'RE RIGHT, THAT DOES HELP. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU ARE NOW  MOVING INTO A SITUATION WHERE  EVERYBODY HAS AN EXPECTATION. THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOUR LIFE IS LIKE BEHIND THOSE WALLS OF  THE WHITE HOUSE. AND THAT'S VERY HARD TO DO, TO  MAKE THAT PIVOT FROM TRYING TO  MANAGE A PRIVATE LIFE IN THE  PUBLIC EYE. BUT THEY'LL MEET A STAFF. WE HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN  ANNOUNCEMENTS ABOUT THE STAFF  FOR MRS. TRUMP YET, AND ONE OF  THE MOST IMPORTANT POSITIONS, I  THINK, CHIEF OF STAFF ASIDE, IS  THE PRESS SECRETARY. >> SHE'S BEING SELF-DEPRACATING. >> WE ALL HAD GREAT PEOPLE TO  WORK WITH AND ALL SORT OF HELPED EACH OTHER, AS NICOLLE KNOWS. IT'S A VERY SPECIAL PLACE TO BE  AND IT REALLY IS SORT OF THE  HEART OF THE COMPLEX, DON'T YOU  THINK? >> THE MOST JADED PEOPLE WALK IN THERE AND SUDDENLY NOT SO JADED. LARGER THAN POLITICS IS THE  PRESIDENCY. >> IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW YOU'RE  CUSTODIAN OF THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE. >> THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST  INTERESTING THINGS. I'VE BEEN THERE WHEN PRESIDENTS  HAVE WALKED INTO THE HOUSE FOR  THE FIRST TIME AND ALSO WHEN  THEY'VE LEFT FOR THE LAST TIME,  BUT WHEN YOU WALK IN FOR THE  FIRST TIME AND YOU'RE BEING  WELCOMED BY THE CHIEF USHER. MR. PRESIDENT, WELCOME TO YOUR  NEW HOME. AND YOU'RE SURROUNDED BY ALL THE FORMER PRESIDENTS, INCLUDING  GEORGE WASHINGTON AND MARTHA  WASHINGTON, THAT IS A  BREATH-TAKING-AWAY EXPERIENCE,  NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. >> THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME FOR US. WE'RE LOOKING AT THE EASTERN  SIDE OF THE CAPITOL WHERE WE'LL  SEE THE PRESIDENT APPEAR  SHORTLY. HE'LL REVIEW THE TROOPS BEFORE  HE BEGINS HIS JOURNEY TO HIS NEW HOME. WE'LL TAKE A BREAK AND SHOW YOU  ♪♪ >> JANUARY 20, 2017 WILL BE  BECAME THE RULERS OF THIS NATION YOUR FAMILY AND THIS COUNTRY  WILL BE FORGOTTEN NO LONGER. >> WITH THOSE WORDS, IT IS TRUMP ERA HAS BEGUN HERE IN  WASHINGTON, THE SWEARING IN, THE INAUGURAL ADDRESS. NOW WE HAVE THE PARADE ROUTE  FROM THE U.S. CAPITOL TO THE  WHITE HOUSE. FROM THE CAPITOL SHORTLY, THE  PROCESSION WILL MAKE ITS WAY  DOWN CONSTITUTION AVENUE TO  PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE. THAT'S WHEN THE PRESIDENT AND  FIRST LADY WILL PASS BY THE  HOTEL ON THEIR RIGHT. THEY'LL PASS BY THE PLAZA BEFORE THEY ARRIVE AT THEIR NEW HOME  FOR THE FIRST TIME AS PRESIDENT  AND FIRST LADY. WE'RE WAITING FOR THAT TO START, BUT WHILE WE DO, LET'S GO TO THE EAST FRONT OF THE CAPITOL. THERE'S A GREAT LIVE PICTURE  RIGHT NOW OF THE PARADE ROUTE. YOU CAN SEE THE POLICE UP FRONT  AND LOTS OF FOLKS. SOME AMERICAN FLAGS ON THE SIDES THERE, PEOPLE PERCHED AMONG THE  MEDIA. IT IS A SPECTACLE TO BEHOLD AS  PART OF THE TRADITION OF  BRINGING IN A NEW PRESIDENCY FOR A NEW TERM. LET'S GO TO CHRIS JANSING ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE CAPITOL WHERE  THE PRESIDENT WILL BE EMERGING. WHAT'S NEXT THERE? >> THE TRADITIONAL REVIEW OF THE TROOPS. THEY HAVE BEEN WAITING HERE  PATIENTLY, LESTER, FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR NOW. THIS PROGRAM RUNNING A LITTLE  BIT BEHIND. REPRESENTATIVES FROM ALL FIVE  BRANCHES, THE ARMY, THE NAVY,  THE AIR FORCE, THE MARINES, THE  COAST GUARD. YOU LOOK AT THEM, AS I HAVE  BEEN, STANDING AT ATTENTION FOR  THE LAST HOUR-PLUS, AND IT  REALLY DOES INSPIRE A SENSE OF  PRIDE AND APPRECIATION FOR ALL  THAT THEY DO, AND YOU HAVE TO  BELIEVE THAT WHEN THE NEWLY  MINTED PRESIDENT TRUMP COMES OUT HERE AND SEES THEM PARADING PAST HIM, THERE HAS TO BE AN AWESOME  SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY THAT HE  IS THE ONE THAT MAKES DECISIONS  TO SEND THEM IN HARM'S WAY AS  THEY HAVE VOLUNTEERED TO DEFEND  AND PROTECT OUR COUNTRY AND OUR  CONSTITUTION. ALSO WORTH NOTING THAT WE SAW  HIM SIGNING THOSE MANY PAPERS  RIGHT BEFORE HE WENT INTO THE  LUNCH AND AFTER THE INAUGURAL  ADDRESS. ONE OF THEM WAS A WAIVER THAT  WOULD ALLOW GENERAL JAMES MATTIS TO RUN THE PENTAGON AS THE  SECRETARY OF DEFENSE SHOULD THE  SENATE APPROVE HIM. I WILL SAY ONE MORE THING, THIS  WILL START THE PARADE. I SPOKE YESTERDAY TO THE CEO OF  THE INAUGURAL COMMITTEE, SARA  ARMSTRONG. SHE SAID ONE OF THE DIRECTIVES  FROM THEN PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP  WAS THAT HE DIDN'T WANT THIS  PARADE TO GO ON AND ON. SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN FOUR  HOURS LONG. SHE SAID IT WILL LAST ABOUT 90  MINUTES, AND TWO REASONS WHY. ONE, HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT PEOPLE STANDING IN THE COLD OR THE  INCLEMENT WEATHER, AND I CAN  TELL YOU THE RAIN HAS BEEN  COMING ON AND OFF. WE'VE BEEN SEEING THE DRIVERS OF THE LIMOUSINES TRYING TO POLISH  THEM EVERY TIME THE RAIN LETS  UP, AND THEN IT STARTS TO RAIN  AGAIN. AND HE WAS ALSO WORRIED ABOUT IT GETTING DARK. AND SO SUNSET HERE IS AT 5:16,  AND AS I CHECK MY WATCH, IF IT'S A 90-MINUTE PARADE, THEY'RE  GETTING CLOSE TO WHAT THE NEW  PRESIDENT CONSIDERS THE CUTOFF  TIME. LESTER? >> ALL RIGHT. CHRIS JANSING, AND KATE SNOW IS  ALONG THE PARADE ROUTE. PEOPLE THERE HAVE BEEN WAITING  NOT AT ATTENTION BUT CERTAINLY  THEY'VE BEEN WAITING IN THE COLD AS WELL. WHAT'S IT LIKE THERE, KATE? >> YEAH, A LOT OF PEOPLE GOT  HERE AROUND 6:00 THIS MORNING TO GET THROUGH THE SECRET SERVICE,  SO YEAH, THEY'VE BEEN WAITING A  LONG TIME FOR THIS. LESTER, LET ME SHOW YOU RIGHT  BEHIND ME, THAT'S THE BEGINNING  OF THE PARADE. YOU CAN SEE SEVERAL MARCHING  BANDS LINED UP IN FORMATION  THERE. YOU SEE THE ARMY WELL  REPRESENTED. THAT'S BECAUSE THIS PARADE WILL  BE KIND OF ORGANIZED INTO FIVE  DIVISIONS BY BRANCH OF MILITARY, BEGINNING WITH THE ARMY, THEN  YOU'LL SEE THE MARINES, THE  NAVY, THE AIR FORCE, AND THE  COAST GUARD. AND WE'RE TOLD THAT AFTER EACH  DIVISION WE'LL ALSO SEE THE BOY  SCOUTS OF AMERICA. THE GIRL SCOUTS ARE HERE AS  WELL. THE TRADITION OF THIS REALLY  DATES BACK ALL THE WAY TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. REMEMBER, HE WENT FROM MT.  VERNON ALL THE WAY UP TO NEW  YORK CITY FOR HIS INAUGURATION. I GUESS WHAT HAPPENED WAS ALONG  THE WAY, ARMIES STARTED TO  FOLLOW HIM AND SORT OF PARADE  ALONGSIDE. SO THAT BECAME SORT OF THE  BEGINNING OF THIS TRADITION. IT WASN'T REALLY FORMAL UNTIL  MADISON, AND NOW HERE WE ARE  WAITING FOR THIS ONE TO BEGIN  VERY ANXIOUSLY HERE, SURROUNDED  BY A LOT OF PEOPLE. >> KATE SNOW, THANK YOU. STEPHANIE GOSK IS AT ONE OF THE  CHECKPOINTS WE SHOWED YOU A  WHILE AGO, THE NAVY MEMORIAL. STEPHANIE, WHEN WE SAW THE  HIGHER SHOT, WE SAW KIND OF A  LINE OF POLICE. WILL PEOPLE HAVE A PRETTY GOOD  VIEW WHEN THEY GO BY? >> Reporter: THEY WILL. THEY'LL HAVE A REASONABLY GOOD  VIEW. WHAT YOU CAN'T SEE IS THAT NAVY  MEMORIAL IS ACTUALLY ELEVATED A  LITTLE BIT, SO THE PEOPLE  GATHERING THERE WILL BE ABLE TO  SEE. THIS IS THE LARGEST PROTEST  ALONG THE PARADE ROUTE. THE ORGANIZERS TOLD US THEY WERE HOPING TO GET 20,000. I CAN TELL YOU THEY'RE CERTAINLY NOWHERE NEAR 20,000 OUT HERE  RIGHT NOW, BUT THEY DO HAVE  THOUSANDS. AND THEY HAVE BEEN INCREASING IN NUMBERS ALL DAY LONG. THE RAIN NOT A DETERRENT FOR  THEM, AND IT IS GETTING LOUDER  AND LOUDER. AND WE DO SEE A LARGER PRESENCE  OF POLICE HERE OUTSIDE THESE  BARRICADES THAN PERHAPS ON THE  OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET WHERE  THERE ARE STANDS FOR SUPPORTERS. NOW, I DO WANT TO ANTICIPATE  PRESIDENT TRUMP POSSIBLY GETTING OUT OF THE MOTORCADE AT SOME  POINT AND WALKING ALONG THE  PARADE ROUTE. IT WOULD SEEM THAT WOULD BE VERY UNLIKELY IN THIS PARTICULAR  SPOT. LESTER? >> ALL RIGHT. STEPHANIE GOSK, THANK YOU VERY  MUCH. AL ROKER IS PART OF OUR COVERAGE TODAY. WE GIVE HIM ONE ASSIGNMENT EVERY INAUGURATION AND WE HOPE HE  COMES THROUGH. WE POSITIONED AL BY THE WHITE  HOUSE, AND WE ASKED ONE THING,  SIMPLY GET A SOUND BITE BY THE  PRESIDENT OR VICE PRESIDENT. IT WORKED IN 2013 BY VICE  PRESIDENT BIDEN. HE CAME OVER TO SHAKE HIS HAND. YOU GOT TO DELIVER. >> WELL, LESTER, I DON'T KNOW. WE'VE GOT A LIGHT DRIZZLE RIGHT  NOW, SO I DON'T KNOW IF THE  PRESIDENT OR THE VICE PRESIDENT  WILL BE GETTING OUT OF THE CAR. BUT IT'S VERY LIGHT, SO WE'RE  BEING VERY HOPEFUL. WE'RE BEING VERY HOPEFUL. WE WILL ENDEAVOR TO GET SOME  SORT OF REACTION FROM PRESIDENT  TRUMP AND VICE PRESIDENT PENCE  AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS. WHO KNOWS? BUT I'M ALWAYS OPTIMISTIC. I'M ALWAYS OPTIMISTIC, AND I  HAVE CANDY WITH ME. SO THAT MAY ALSO BE SOMETHING  THAT THEY -- YOU NEVER KNOW. A NICE SNACK BETWEEN THE LUNCH  AND THE REVIEWING STAND. YOU DON'T KNOW HOW THAT MIGHT  GO. >> THE PRESIDENT LIKES HIS  McDONALD'S. MAYBE YOU SHOULD SNEAK OVER AND  GET McDONALD'S. >> I ACTUALLY HAVE A TACO BELL  TACO IN MY POCKET. >> WHERE ARE YOU IN RELATION TO  THE WHITE HOUSE? >> WE ARE ALMOST DAGONALLY --  IF WE COULD SPIN OVER THIS WAY. HERE'S THE WHITE HOUSE OVER HERE AND THE REVIEWING STAND JUST A  LITTLE FURTHER DOWN. WE'RE IN PRIME POSITION RIGHT  HERE. AGAIN, I'VE GOT SNICKERS BARS. THAT'S ALSO A GOOD THING. >> YOU ALSO HAVE A BIG POLICE  OFFICER THERE BEHIND YOU SO  BEHAVE. >> I DO. HE'S BEEN MOVING WITH ME. HE OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T TRUST ME. WHERE I GO, HE'S GOING. I DON'T KNOW. IT'S LIKE -- HE'S LIKE A HUMAN  BLOCKADE, SO I MAY HAVE  PROBLEMS. >> WASHINGTON'S FINEST DOING A  GREAT JOB OUT THERE. THANK YOU, AL. WE'LL LOOK FOR YOU. HOPEFULLY WE'LL WELCOME YOU BACK WITH A SOUND BITE. >>> WE CONTINUE TO WATCH THAT  PARADE. THEY WILL BE KICKING OFF VERY  SHORTLY. AS WE NOTED, THOSE TROOPS THERE. LET'S GO TO A SHOT ON THE EAST  FRONT. THERE IS THE PRESIDENT AND THE  FIRST LADY AND THE VICE  PRESIDENT AND MRS. PENCE. THEY WILL REVIEW THE TROOPS. >> IT IS GREAT, AGAIN, THAT THE  WEATHER IS SOMEWHAT WARM. I'M THINKING ABOUT THIS FOR ALL  THOSE FOLKS IN THE PARADE, THE  TROOPS, AND AGAIN, THOSE GREAT  HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS PLAYING  THOSE INSTRUMENTS. THEY'LL NOT HAVE THOSE  MOUTHPIECES STICK TO THEIR LIPS. >> BAND GUY, PTSD. 3 INSTRUMENTOS  ♪♪ ♪♪ 3 ♪♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ >> PRESIDENT TRUMP IS REVIEWING  THE TROOPS BEFORE HE BEGINS TO  MAKE HIS WAY TO THE INAUGURAL  PARADE. SERVICE PEOPLE IN HARM'S WAY  EVEN AS WE SPEAK. AFGHANISTAN, IRAQ, FIGHTING AIR  MISSIONS OVER TARGETS IN SYRIA,  JUST TO MENTION A FEW IN THE  WORLD. >> UNINTERRUPTED TODAY. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THIS. UNINTERRUPTED. THAT'S THE AMAZING ASPECT OF  THIS.  >> AND KNOWING THEIR LIVES ARE  IN YOUR HANDS AS WE SET THIS IN  MOTION. HIS FIRST REMINDER OF THAT WITH  THIS CEREMONIAL REVIEWING OF THE TROOPS. THE PRESIDENT AND FIRST LADY NOW WILL MAKE THEIR WAY OUT OF THE  CAPITOL ON INDEPENDENCE -- OR  CONSTITUTION AVENUE? CONSTITUTION. CONSTITUTION AVENUE, YEAH, THEN  ON TO PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE. >> OF COURSE, THANKS TO ANDREW  JACKSON, IT'S NOT A STRAIGHT  SHOT. >> THERE IS A STORY BEHIND THAT. >> THERE IS A STORY. >> GO RIGHT AHEAD. >> DONALD TRUMP IS JACKSONIAN. HE WOULD APPRECIATE IT, RIGHT? HE HATED CONGRESS SO MUCH? >> HE DID NOT WANT IT TO BE A  STRAIGHT SHOT. >> AND HE BUILT TREASURY. HE WANTED HIS VIEW BLOCKED. HOW ABOUT THAT? >> I KNEW I'D LEARN SOMETHING  SITTING BETWEEN YOU TWO. >> WE'RE TRYING. >> WE'LL GIVE YOU ONE MORE. HOW ABOUT THE BLAIR HOUSE AND  ANDREW JACKSON? >> BLAIR WAS FRANCIS BLAIR WHO  WAS ANDREW JACKSON'S CLOSE  FRIEND AND POLITICAL ADVISER,  AND AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS THE  PUBLISHER OF THE WASHINGTON  GLOBE, WHICH WAS THE OFFICIAL  DEMOCRATIC NEWSPAPER, AND  BASICALLY SORT OF -- THAT DAY'S  VERSION OF STATE-RUN TELEVISION  OR STATE-RUN NEWSPAPER, AND HE  ALSO KEPT A MILK COW IN THE  GARDEN AND BROUGHT MILK TO  JACKSON EVERY DAY WHICH HELPED  TO KEEP UP THE FRIENDSHIP. >> BLAIR BOUGHT THAT HOUSE AND  THEN GAVE IT TO HIM. >> I FEEL LIKE MY HOUSE WAS  BEING CRAFTED RIGHT HERE. >> HERE'S ALL I HAD TO LEARN  FROM MICHAEL. >> WHEN WAS THE FIRST TIME A  PRESIDENT RODE FOR A WHILE IN AN ARMORED LIMOUSINE? >> RODE FOR --  >> IN OTHER WORDS, STARTED  RIDING REGULARLY IN AN ARMORED  LIMOUSINE? IT WAS ACTUALLY AFTER PEARL  HARBOR, BECAUSE AFTER THE PEARL  HARBOR ATTACK IN 1941, FRANKLIN  ROOSEVELT'S SECURITY PEOPLE SAID THIS CAR THAT YOU HAVE, WHICH IS OFTENTIMES OPEN, MAY PUT YOU IN  DANGER. SO THEY LOOKED FOR A CAR QUICKLY THAT WAS ARMORED. THE ONLY ONE THEY COULD FIND WAS A CAR THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD  CONFISCATED FROM, OF ALL PEOPLE, AL CAPONE. SO ROOSEVELT RODE UP TO HIS  FIRST CONGRESS IN AL CAPONE'S  CAR. >> I FLUNKED ""JEOPARDY"" THE  WORST. >> I LOVE THE AL CAPONE  CONNECTION. >> THIS IS NOT THE PARADE  ITSELF, BUT THEY'RE MAKING THEIR WAY OFF THE CAPITOL GROUNDS. HE'S GOT A LITTLE COMPANY THERE  AS HE MAKES HIS WAY AWAY FROM  THE CAPITOL. IT'S BEEN A TRADITION THE LAST  SEVERAL -- THIS IS WHERE YOU CAN HELP ME -- THE LAST SEVERAL  INAUGURATIONS WHERE THE  PRESIDENT AND FIRST LADY COME  OUT FOR A WHILE. WHO STARTED THAT? >> STARTED WALKING? >> YEAH. >> IN RECENT TIMES, THOMAS  JEFFERSON DID IN DAYS OF YORE,  BUT 1977, JIMMY CARTER AND  ROSLYN CARTER WALKED NOT IN THE  WAY WE'VE SEEN IN RECENT YEARS  BECAUSE OF SECURITY FOR A SHORT  DISTANCE NEAR THE WHITE HOUSE. THEY WALKED ALMOST THE ENTIRE  ROUTE, OVER A MILE, AND CARTER  LATER ON SAID THIS WAS MY WAY OF EXPRESSING THE FACT THAT I HAD  FAITH IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE  THAT NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN TO ME  AND THAT I WAS BEGINNING A NEW  OPEN --  >> AS THE THREAT OF ENVIRONMENT  HAS CHANGED OVER THE YEARS, ARE  WE BECOMING MORE AND MORE  PERSONALLY DISCONNECTED FROM OUR PRESIDENT? >> CERTAINLY SO. AS CHUCK WAS MENTIONING, JOHN  KENNEDY, BEFORE THE TRAGEDY OF  DALLAS, WOULD RIDE IN THESE OPEN CARS FOR 20 MILES, AND PEOPLE  WOULD COME UP TO HIM AND SHAKE  HANDS, AND KENNEDY SAID,  ACTUALLY, JUST BEFORE DALLAS TO  THE SECRET SERVICE AGENTS, I  DON'T EVEN WANT YOU WALKING  AROUND MY CAR OR STANDING ON THE RUNNING BOARDS BECAUSE IT MAKES  ME SEEM INACCESSIBLE. I HAVE TO BE ACCESSIBLE TO THE  PEOPLE, HE SAID, ESPECIALLY  BECAUSE I'M RUNNING FOR  REELECTION. >> THIS IS THE PICTURE, YOU'RE  RIGHT, I REMEMBER THIS NOW, THE  CARTERS WALKING VIRTUALLY THE  WHOLE WAY, RIGHT? >> AND THAT WAS A RISK. THIS WOULD NEVER HAPPEN NOWADAYS FOR OBVIOUS REASONS, BUT EVEN IN 1977, THAT WAS TWO YEARS AFTER  TWO VERY NEAR MISS ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS AGAINST GERALD FORD. >> I THOUGHT I HEARD THE VOICE  OF JOHN CHANCELLOR. ALWAYS NICE TO HEAR THAT. >> YEAH. >> AND SPEAKING OF THE CAR,  LYNDON JOHNSON AFTER DALLAS, FOR REASONS MAINLY OF THE ECONOMY,  TOOK PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S CAR  THAT HAD BEEN IN DALLAS, QUIETLY REFURBISHED, HAD AN ARMORED HARD TOP PUT ON IT AND IT WAS THE  SAME CAR. SO THE CAR LBJ RODE IN IN 1965,  NO ONE KNEW IT, BUT THAT WAS  THAT SAME CONTINENTAL CAR FROM  DALLAS. >> ON THE ""TODAY"" SHOW, WE WENT  TO A SECRET SERVICE TRAINING  SHOW -- I BELIEVE IT WAS IN  MARYLAND. THEY HAVE AN OLD BEAST AND THEY  HAVE A MOCKUP OF A JET AND THEY  DO THE WHOLE THING WHERE I'M THE PROTECTEE AND SOMETHING HAPPENS, AND THEY SHOVE YOU IN THE BACK. IT ALL HAPPENED SO FLUIDLY, BUT  YOU CAN SEE THE PHALANX OF  SECURITY THERE FOR THE NEW  PRESIDENT, AND THIS HAS BECOME  STANDARD. >> IT HAS, IF YOU THINK ABOUT  IT. WE TALK ABOUT PENNSYLVANIA  AVENUE, WE TALK ABOUT TREASURY. WHEN I FIRST GOT HERE IN BILL  CLINTON'S FIRST TERM, YOU GOT  STUCK IN TRAFFIC IN FRONT OF  PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE IN FRONT OF  THE WHITE HOUSE, BOTH SIDES. NOW THERE ARE NO CIVILIAN CARS  THAT ARE ALLOWED, REALLY, TO  DRIVE ON EITHER SIDE OF THE  WHITE HOUSE ANYMORE. >> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. >> SINCE WE'RE DOING TRIVIA, LET ME JUST, OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD, I REMEMBER THIS PICTURE FROM  1953. THFLS THE FIRST-- THIS WAS THE  FIRST NBC VEHICLE TO COVER THE  INAUGURATION. IT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE A HEARSE. THAT'S HOW WE USED TO GET IN  FRONT OF THE PARADE TO SHOOT IT. AND LET ME SHOW YOU HOW WE DO IT IN 2017. BETTER YET, LET'S LET KRISTEN  WELKER SHOW US WHAT IT LOOKS  LIKE. HI, KRISTEN. >> Reporter: HI, LESTER. WE'RE ABOUT TO SET OFF. WE'RE RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE  CAPITOL ABOUT TO TURN ONTO  CONSTITUTION. WE'RE AT THE CENTER OF  CONSTITUTION AND DELAWARE. YOU'RE TALKING SO MUCH HISTORY. A LOT OF FOLKS HAVE BEEN  BRINGING UP JIMMY CARTER TODAY,  THE FACT HE WALKED THE ENTIRE  LENGTH OF THE PARADE ROUTE,  REALLY THE ONLY PRESIDENT TO DO  THAT. WE WERE THINKING ABOUT HIM  BECAUSE OF THE RAIN AND  WONDERING WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO SEE PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AT  ALL, WHETHER THEY'LL GET OUT AND WALK A PORTION OF THE PARADE  ROUTE. IF HE DOES, WE'RE LOOKING AT  TRUMP HOTEL TO SEE IF POSSIBLY  THAT'S A PLACE WHERE HE GETS OUT AND WAVES TO PEOPLE AND THEN  WALKS THE REST OF THE LENGTH TO  THE WHITE HOUSE. WE'LL HAVE TO SEE IF THAT  HAPPENS. BUT WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE HAVE  BEEN LINED UP SINCE 6:00 A.M.  THIS MORNING. A LOT OF ANTICIPATION. THIS IS ALWAYS ONE OF THE MORE  EXCITING PARTS OF THE INAUGURAL  CELEBRATIONS. AND BECAUSE YOU'RE TALKING  HISTORY, I'LL GIVE YOU A FEW  MORE HISTORICAL NUGGETS ABOUT  THIS GREAT PARADE. ONE IS THAT THE FIRST TIME  AFRICAN-AMERICANS PARTICIPATED  IN THIS PARADE WAS UNDER  PRESIDENT LINCOLN IN 1865, AND  THE FIRST TIME THAT WOMEN  PARTICIPATED IN THE PARADE WAS  1917 UNDER PRESIDENT WOODROW  WILSON. SO A LITTLE BIT MORE HISTORY TO  CHEW ON AS WE AWAIT PRESIDENT  TRUMP AND THE FIRST LADY MELANIA TAKING THEIR RIDE DOWN THIS  HISTORIC ROUTE. LESTER? >> KRISTEN, THANKS. I THINK WE HAVE THIS WE CAN POP  UP. IT'S A REMARKABLE PICTURE FROM  PETE SOUZA, THE PROFESSIONAL  PHOTOGRAPHER THAT WAS TAKEN --  DO WE HAVE THE PICTURE FROM  MARINE I? ACTUALLY, FROM EXECUTIVE I? IT WAS PUT UP A SHORT TIME AGO. >> IT'S PROBABLY ON INSTAGRAM. >> I'LL BRING IT UP IN A BIT. IT'S A GREAT PICTURE OF  PRESIDENT OBAMA LOOKING DOWN AT  THE WHITE HOUSE FROM THE  CHOPPER. >> IT WAS INAUGURAL TRIVIA FROM  A THOUSAND. >> THIS PAGEANTRY OF THIS DAY,  EVEN AT THE LUNCHEON, WE HEARD  DONALD TRUMP TALKING ABOUT  HIS --  >> THERE IT IS. THERE'S THAT PICTURE NOT FROM  MARINE I, BUT EXECUTIVE I, AND  YOU SEE THE REVIEWING STAND  THERE IN THE FOREGROUND. EIGHT YEARS THAT THEY WERE THE  OCCUPANTS. >> IT'S A GREAT TRADITION THAT  AS THE PRESIDENTS LEAVE, THEY  GIVE THEM THIS FINAL SORT OF  CIRCLE OF THE MALL, RIGHT,  MICHAEL, THEY ALL GET TO VIEW -- TALK ABOUT RARE, NOT A LOT OF  PEOPLE GET TO SEE THAT VIEW. >> RONALD REAGAN IN 1989 WAS  TAKING EXACTLY THIS TRIP WITH  NANCY, AND JUST AT THE SAME  MOMENT OF THE SNAPSHOT WE JUST  SAW, RONALD REAGAN SAID TO  NANCY, HONEY, THERE IS OUR  LITTLE SHACK. MADE THE TURN AND WENT ON TO  ANDREWS. >> I LOVE WHAT FORMER PRESIDENT  OBAMA SAID THE OTHER DAY IN HIS  NEWS CONFERENCE ABOUT BEING AN  EX-PRESIDENT. HE SAID, I WON'T MISS HEARING MY VOICE, OR SOMETHING TO THAT  EFFECT. >> BUT THEY ALL MISS MARINE I  AND AIR FORCE I, EVERY LAST ONE  OF THEM. I WAS THINKING FOR THE IMAGERY  OF THIS DAY, DONALD TRUMP IS  FROM OUTSIDE OF POLITICS, BUT  JUST AN HOUR AGO AT HIS  LUNCHEON, HE WAS TALKING ABOUT  GENERAL MATTIS LOOKING LIKE HE  WAS FROM CENTRAL CASTING. I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW HOW HE'S  EXPERIENCING THIS DAY. I DON'T KNOW THAT HE'S EVEN BEEN TO AN INAUGURATION BEFORE, DO  YOU? DOES ANYONE KNOW? >> I THINK WE WOULD KNOW IF THAT HAPPENED. >> IT'S INTERESTING, THOUGH, HE  DOES THINK VISUALLY, VERY MUCH  SO. >> JUST LIKE CHOOSING A  SECRETARY OF STATE. >> EXACTLY. AND A VICE PRESIDENT. >> IT SUPPOSEDLY WASN'T HELPFUL  TO BOB CORKER THAT HE DIDN'T  AND LOOK, THE FACT IS HE GETS  IT. HE GETS IT. HE KNOWS HOW TO CONNECT. >> HE KNOWS OUR BUSINESS VERY  WELL. HE KNOWS HOW THE CAMERA WORKS. EVERY TIME I SAT DOWN WITH HIM,  HE HAS MADE SOME COMMENT ABOUT  THE ARRANGEMENT. HE GOES, OKAY, WE GOT A CAMERA  THERE, WE GOT A CAMERA THERE. >> I'VE DONE INTERVIEWS WHERE  AFTER WE'RE DONE, HE WANTS TO  TAKE A LOOK AT IT. HE'S MINDFULLY -- HE'S A BRAIN,  AND HE HAS HIS BRAIN. HE'S ALWAYS REPRESENTED THE  EXACT SAME WAY. >> BEHIND THAT THICK GLASS IS  THE END OF THE NEW PRESIDENT AND THE FIRST LADY AS THIS  PROFESSION IS FORMALLY UNDER  WAY. WE DON'T BELIEVE THEY HAVE MADE  THEIR WAY IN FRONT OF ANY CROWDS YET, BUT THEY SOON WILL MAKE THE TURN HERE. IT LOOKS LIKE MAINLY STAFF  MILITARY. >> IT FEELS LIKE THE PARADE AS  THEY MERGE WITH EVERYTHING. >> WE CAN SEE THEM OUT OUR  WINDOW. >> WE'RE ALL PEEKING OUT OUR  WINDOW TO SEE IF WE CAN SEE IT. >> YEAH, WE CAN SEE IT. >> WE DO. IT IS BEHIND US. WE HAVE A PRETTY GOOD VIEW HERE. >> YEAH. >> BUT YOU GUYS ON WATCHING HAVE A BETTER VIEW, WE PROMISE. WE ARE GIVING YOU THE BEST VIEW. >> I WAS GOING TO SAY THESE  THINGS ARE NOT QUITE AS MILITARY AS THEY SOMETIMES WERE DURING  THE COLD WAR. KENNEDYS IN 1961, YOU SAW NIKE  MISSILES AND OTHER ARMY --  >> WE HEARD -- THEY WERE  SCUTTLEBUTT, NOBODY WAS SURE IF  THE TRUMP TRANSITION KNEW  WHETHER THERE SHOULD BE MORE  MILITARY PRESENCE, BUT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WASN'T SO KEEN ON IT. >> WE HEARD HIS SPEECH WHERE HE  WASN'T SO CRITICAL OF THE  TRADITIONS. NOW HE'S IN WASHINGTON, AND FOR  THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE, HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO REPORT TO  SOMEONE. HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE  ACCOUNTABLE TO THIS THING CALLED CONGRESS, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WHAT'S THAT GOING TO BE LIKE? WE'VE SEEN HIM TRY TO USE HIS  PERSONALITY WITH COMPANIES,  BOEING AND CARRIER AND THAT SORT OF THING. IS THAT GOING TO PLAY? >> I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE  UNEVEN. I THINK HE WILL HAVE IMPULSES TO WORK WITH PEOPLE LIKE CHUCK  SCHUMER, A NEW YORKER, WHO HE'S  KNOWN A VERY LONG TIME ON THINGS THEY BOTH CARE ABOUT, LIKE  INFRASTRUCTURE. BUT THERE WILL BE LIMITS, I  THINK, EVEN ON HIS OWN STAFF IN  TERMS OF HOW MUCH RUNNING ROOM  THEY'LL GIVE HIM TO WORK WITH  DEMOCRATS. THERE ARE SOME VERY IDEALOGICAL  PEOPLE INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE,  AND THERE ARE NON-IDEALOGICAL  PEOPLE INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE. BUT FOR A WHILE, MOST OF THE  STRUGGLES THAT BREAK OUT AND YOU READ ABOUT IN THE PRESS COVERAGE WILL BE IN THE TRUMP WING AND  PEOPLE AFRAID TO WEIGH IN ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER ON PUTIN AND  RUSSIA AND HOW AGGRESSIVE THEY  SHOULD BE. I THINK THE WHITE HOUSE STAFF  MAY BREAK DOWN JUST HOW GENEROUS TO BE IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH THEY  SPEND ON INFRASTRUCTURE TO GET  SOMETHING DONE. I THINK DONALD TRUMP'S IMPULSE  WILL BE TO GET DEALS DONE, BUT I THINK HE WILL FEEL HEMMED IN BY  THE STRUCTURE OF THE WHITE HOUSE AND BY SOME OF THE PEOPLE AROUND HIM. >> HE IS, BUT I TELL YOU, HE  REALLY -- TALK ABOUT SOMEBODY  THAT YOU CAN TELL LOVES THE IDEA THAT IT IS A BULLY PULPIT, EVERY NEW PRESIDENT COMES IN THINKING, HOW AM I GOING TO USE IT? I THINK SOME USE IT BETTER THAN  OTHERS, BUT BOY, DONALD TRUMP  PLANS ON USING IT IN WAYS WE  HAVEN'T SEEN IN QUITE SOME TIME. RONALD REAGAN USED IT AND WOULD  TALK OVER WASHINGTON A LITTLE  BIT, OVER THE PRESS, BUT IT WAS  ALWAYS IN VERY ELEGANT TONES. THIS IS DIFFERENT. THIS IS GOING TO BE A VERY  CONFRONTATIONAL LEADER, AND HOW  HE DOES IT, I THINK HE'S BEEN  VERY SHREWD. >> YOU KNOW HOW MOM AND DAD USED TO SAY, BECAUSE I SAID SO. HE USES A LOT OF THAT. HE MAKES A DECLARATION AND IT IS THEREFORE SO, BUT IT'S A  DIFFERENT THING RUNNING UP  AGAINST THE POLITICAL --  >> NICOLLE, WE TALK ABOUT THE  SPEECH WHERE HE WENT WITH A  DIVISIVE TONE INSTEAD OF A  UNIFYING TONE. AT THE SAME TIME, IT IS  REMARKABLE, ACTUALLY, HOW  IDEALOGICALLY DIVERSE THE STAFF  IS. THERE REALLY IS -- HE BROUGHT  INTENTION INTO HIS OWN WHITE  HOUSE OF THE IDEALOGICALS, THE  MIKE PENCE WING OF THE PARTY. MIKE PENCE/PAUL RYAN WING OF THE PARTY IN ONE PLACE AND THEN  SIMULTANEOUSLY HAVING THE  LIBERTARIAN STREAK, THE OUTSIDER STREAK, THE POPULIST OUT THERE. AND IDEALOGICALLY NEUTRAL  DEMOCRATICALLY JARED KUSHNER OR  GARY KOHN. THAT'S A HEALTHY THING TO DO,  RIGHT? >> IT'S A VERY HEALTHY THING TO  DO AS LONG AS YOU HAVE THE  PRESIDENT INVOLVED MANAGING THE  COMPETITION. IF THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN, THEY ALL BASICALLY KILL EACH OTHER BY THE CONSTANT WARFARE. ONE GREAT EXAMPLE OF THIS WAS  DURING REAGAN, YOU HAD GEORGE  SCHULTZ WHO WAS IN FAVOR OF  TRYING TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE  SOVIETS AS THEY THEN WERE, AND  CASPER WEINBERGER WHO WAS  BUILDING UP DEFENSE TO BE AS  TOUGH AS POSSIBLE. IT WAS A GRAND SERVICE TO RONALD REAGAN THAT YOU HAD THOSE TWO  PEOPLE PRESENTING DIFFERENT  POINTS OF VIEW AND DEBAING ALL  THE TIME AND REAGAN COULD  CHOOSE. EVEN REAGAN FINALLY GOT TIRED OF IT AND GOT RID OF WEINBERGER AND GOT A DEFENSE SECRETARY WHO WAS  A LITTLE BIT MORE --  >> BUT I DON'T THINK TRUMP WILL  TIRED OF IT. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HIS TEAM FOR A MINUTE. KELLYANNE CONWAY IS THE FACE OF  THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY, AND SHE  WENT TO WAR WITH MITT ROMNEY AT  THE VERY MOMENT THAT MITT ROMNEY WAS BELIEVED TO BE A CANDIDATE  FOR SECRETARY OF STATE. THERE WERE NO --  >> ASSUMING THAT SHE WAS NOT  ASKED TO DO THAT. >> WE'LL NEVER KNOW. BUT IT PLAYED OUT IN PUBLIC VIEW ON TELEVISION, WHICH WE KNOW  DONALD TRUMP WATCHES A WHOLE LOT OF. SO I'M NOT SURE THAT DONALD  TRUMP WILL EVER TIRE OF THE  SPECTACLE OF THESE PROXY FIGHTS  PLAYING OUT. AND THAT WILL BE RIVETING, BUT  IT'S NOT CLEAR HOW MUCH OF IT  WILL BE REAL. >> IT'S INTERESTING, THERE IS A  RECENT EXAMPLE OF SOMEONE LIKE  TRUMP ASCENDING TO POWER LIKE  THIS AND IT'S ARNOLD  SCHWARZENEGGER IN CALIFORNIA. THE L.A. TIMES HAS DONE SOME  TREMENDOUS WORK SHOWING THERE'S  A LOT MORE PARALLELS. ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER CAME IN  WITH SORT OF THE SAME SPLIT  PERSONALITY. ROCK-RIBBED CONSERVATIVES AROUND HIM FOR CALIFORNIA, BUT THEN AT  THE SAME TIME, YOU KNOW, THERE  WAS SORT OF -- YOU COULD ARGUE  MAYBE IT WAS THE MARIA SHRIVER  WING OF HIM, AND HE SHIFTED. HE BASICALLY WAS A LITTLE MORE  IDEALOGICAL AT THE BEGINNING. IT DIDN'T WORK. AND HE LITERALLY HIRED A  DEMOCRAT AS HIS CHIEF OF STAFF  AND SHIFTED AND SORT OF MOVED  WITH THE WINDS A LITTLE BIT SO  HE COULD GET A FEW THINGS DONE,  AND HE HAD TROUBLES IN THE FIRST FEW YEARS WHEN IT WAS MORE  IDEALOGICAL, AND HE ACTUALLY HAD SOME WINS TOWARD THE END. >> HERE'S SOME OF THE VIEW THAT  THE PRESIDENT WILL SEE, AND THAT VIEW LOOKING BACK AT THE  MOTORCADE, THAT'S THE SAME ONE  THAT KRISTEN WELKER HAS BECAUSE  I BELIEVE SHE'S ON THAT VEHICLE. KRISTEN, HAS THE PROCESSION  REACHED THE CROWDS YET? >> Reporter: WE HAVE JUST  REACHED THE CROWDS, LESTER, AND  I CAN TELL YOU WE'VE JUST  STARTED TO HEAR THEM CHANTING  AND CHEERING, AND WE'RE JUST  PASSING SOMEONE HOLDING A TRUMP  2016 SIGN. RIGHT NOW A LOT OF FOLKS HAVE  THEIR MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN  HATS ON. MOST PEOPLE HAVE THEIR CELL  PHONES OUT AND THEY ARE TAKING  PICTURES, TRYING TO CAPTURE THIS HISTORIC MOMENT. WE ARE TRAVELING NOW WHAT SEEMS  LIKE A FAIRLY LOW RATE OF SPEED  THROUGH THIS PARADE ROUTE. AND THAT'S GIVING THE FOLKS TIME TO REALLY ABSORB IT, REALLY TAKE ALL OF THIS IN. WE JUST PASSED THE TAFT MEMORIAL A FEW MOMENTS AGO. YOU HAVE PEOPLE ACTUALLY LOOKING OUT AT THE PARADE FROM THEIR  WINDOWS WAVING, TRYING TO GET A  GLIMPSE OF THE 45th PRESIDENT. OF COURSE, THIS IS A TRADITION  THAT DATES ALL THE WAY BACK TO  THE FIRST PRESIDENT, GEORGE  WASHINGTON, OF COURSE, HIS  PARADE ROUTE LOOKED VERY  DIFFERENT. HE WENT FROM MT. VERNON TO NEW  YORK WHERE HE TOOK HIS OATH OF  OFFICE, AND HE WAS FOLLOWED BY  TROOPS ALONG THE WAY. AND THAT IS PART OF WHY WE HAVE  THIS MILITARY PRESENCE HERE, AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT THERE ARE  MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY LINED UP ALL ALONG THE PARADE ROUTE AS  WELL AS WE CONTINUE TO TRAVEL  TOWARD THE WHITE HOUSE. SO A LOT OF EXCITEMENT HERE, A  LOT OF PEOPLE CHEERING,  CHANTING. WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY PROTESTERS  YET, BUT OF COURSE WE HAVE  GOTTEN REPORTS OF THEM A LITTLE  BIT FURTHER ALONG THE PARADE  ROUTE, SO WE'LL LOOK FOR THOSE. BUT AS OF RIGHT NOW, A LOT OF  FOLKS CHEERING, A LOT OF MAKE  AMERICA GREAT AGAIN HATS AND  TRUMP SIGNS ON THE SIDE. LESTER? >> ALL RIGHT, KRISTEN. CHUCK, I'LL ASK YOU ABOUT THIS  SINCE YOU LIVE HERE. THIS ISN'T LOST, THOUGH, AS WE  SEE THOSE CROWDS. I THINK 91% OF PEOPLE IN THE  DISTRICT VOTED FOR HILLARY  CLINTON. >> I'M GOING TO GIVE AWAY A  LITTLE SOMETHING YOU'LL SEE ON  SUNDAY, BUT IT IS INTERESTING,  OVER THE LAST 25 YEARS, WHEN YOU LOOK AT REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTS,  WHEN RONALD REAGAN WAS  INAUGERATED IN 1991, HE ONLY HAD TO GO ACROSS THE DISTRICTS  BORDER TO GO TO A COUNTY THAT  VOTED FOR HIM. RIGHT THERE, THE SUBURBAN. IN 1988, GEORGE W. BUSH HAD TO  GO ABOUT 25 MILES FROM  WASHINGTON, D.C. TO FIND THE  FIRST PLACE WHERE HE CARRIED. DONALD TRUMP, WE BELIEVE, HAS TO GO 50 MILES TO FIND A COUNTY IN  EITHER DIRECTION, CALVERT  COUNTY, MARYLAND, OR I BELIEVE  IT'S FOLKIER COUNTY, VIRGINIA. WHY DOES THAT MATTER? I BELIEVE IT CONTRIBUTES TO THE  CROWD SIZE. HERE'S WHY IT ALSO MATTERS. PEOPLE IN THAT 50-MILE RADIUS,  THERE ARE A LOT OF FEDERAL  WORKERS. A LOT OF THEM WORK FOR DONALD  TRUMP TODAY, THE EXECUTIVE  BRANCH. THIS IS AN INTERESTING TENSION. THESE PEOPLE WORK FOR DONALD  TRUMP AND DONALD TRUMP IS THEIR  BOSS, AND FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO  FUNCTION WELL, HE NEEDS TO HAVE  A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS  EMPLOYEES. AND THIS IS GOING TO BE AN  INTERESTING TENSION THAT IS  THERE WHEN YOU KNOW YOUR WORK  FORCE DIDN'T VOTE FOR YOU. >> AND HE CAME OUT WITH A FAIR  AMOUNT OF CONTEMPT FOR  WASHINGTON, AS WE KNOW, IN HIS  SPEECH. >> BY THE WAY, TRUMP SUPPORTERS  LOVE THAT FACT THAT THERE IS  THAT TENSION. >> WE SAW STEVE BANNON A BIT  EARLIER IN THE DAY. HOW MUCH OF THAT SPEECH DO YOU  THINK WAS REFLECTED IN HIM AS AN ARCHITECT? >> MY SENSE IS THAT WAS BANNON'S MESSAGE. THAT WAS BANNON-ESQUE. IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN A REINCE  PRIEBUS SPEECH, WHO IS CHIEF OF  STAFF. STEVE BANNON AND DONALD TRUMP  HAVE CHANNELLED EACH OTHER, I  THINK, IN SOME WAYS. >> YEAH. THE BEST ADVISERS ALWAYS DO. >> WE GOT HIM BACK IN THE GAME  IN MANY WAYS. >> HE DID, AND STEVE BANNON HAS  TAPPED INTO, AND HE BELIEVES IN  THIS NATIONALIST MOVEMENT THAT  HE BELIEVES IS SPREADING  INTERNATIONALLY, PARTICULARLY  STRONG RIGHT NOW IN EUROPE. WE SEE IT. AND HE DOES WANT TO TAP INTO  THAT AROUND THE WORLD. >> WE SEE THE CROWDS WAVING NOW  AS THE PRESIDENT'S LIMOUSINE  COMES INTO VIEW. ONE CARRYING THE PRESIDENT AND  FIRST LADY, THE OTHER THE VICE  PRESIDENT AND HIS WIFE. >> WE KNOW NUMBER 1 IS THE  PRESIDENT THERE. WHAT DO YOU THINK? LICENSE PLATE NUMBER 1? >> WE'RE GOING TO GO WITH THAT. >> YEAH. YOU TALKED EARLIER ABOUT THE  VIEW FROM INSIDE THE BEAST, THE  PRESIDENTIAL LIMO. I TOOK A LOT OF RIDES WITH  PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH AND YOU CAN SEE EVERYTHING. GEORGE BUSH HAD A PRACTICE OF -- EVERYONE GOT A THUMBS UP WHETHER THEY WERE THERE TO PROTEST THE  IRAQ WAR OR WHETHER THEY WERE  THERE TO SHOW THEIR SUPPORT. I THINK IT WILL BE INTERESTING  TO SEE IF HE CAN GROW SOME THICK SKIN BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A LOT  YOU CAN DO FROM INSIDE THE  MOTORCADE. IT'S SORT OF SYMBOLIC, BUT FROM  INSIDE --  >> DO YOU THINK ANYBODY COMES IN THAT JOB, THOUGH, WITH A THICK  SKIN? >> SOME PEOPLE MORE THAN OTHERS. I THINK THAT NO DRAMA OBAMA WAS  MUCH MORE FOCUSED ON THE  CRITIQUE OF HIM AT THE  BEGINNING. HE TALKED A LOT ABOUT FOX NEWS  AT THE BEGINNING OF HIS  PRESIDENCY AND HE SEEMED TO GROW A LITTLE LESS MOLESTED BY THINGS THEY SAID. GEORGE W. BUSH NEVER CARED. SOMEONE VERY CLOSE TO HIM, MAYBE IN HIS FAMILY, SAID KEITH OVERN  IS THE WORST PERSON IN THE  WORLD. AND I SAID, PLEASE, HE DOESN'T  EVEN KNOW HIM. >> HE OBVIOUSLY CARES ABOUT HIS  MEDIA. >> DONALD TRUMP CARES VERY MUCH. >> I THINK IT WAS LIKE, STOP,  TELL SENATOR McCAIN TO STOP  TURNING ON THE TELEVISION IN HIS HOTEL ROOM EVERY NIGHT. >> WE HAD A WHOLE SCAM, MARK  SALTER AND I, WITH SENATOR  McCAIN. WE USED TO TRY TO GET THE GAMES, FIVE BASEBALL GAMES, AND WE  WOULD TRY TO GET THE GAMES UP  BEFORE HE COULD START FLIPPING  AROUND THE CHANNELS AND HIDE THE REMOTE. I DON'T KNOW IF PRESIDENT TRUMP  IS BOTHERED BY IT, I KNOW HE'S  AFFECTED BY IT, BUT IT CAN  BECOME AN IMPEDIMENT. >> LET ME GO TO KATE SNOW  BECAUSE I THINK THE MOTORCADE IS NOW REACHING HER LOCATION. >> Reporter: IT IS. IT IS, LESTER, AND IF YOU LOOK  AT OUR SHOT, WHAT YOU SEE ARE  THE PRESS VEHICLES RIGHT NOW  JUST AHEAD OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S  LIMOUSINE. I CAN SEE THE LIMO COMING INTO  VIEW. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN HEAR THE CROWD AROUND ME, BUT THEY'RE  SHOUTING TRUMP, TRUMP, TRUMP. >> I THINK THEY'RE SAFE. >> Reporter: A LOT OF EXCITEMENT HERE. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR  HOURS. A LOT OF FOLKS HAD TO SPEND A  LONG TIME GOING THROUGH  SECURITY. IT'S BEEN RAINING OFF AND ON. IT'S IN THE 40s. IT'S NOT PARTICULARLY WARM  TODAY. SINGLE PERSON I HAVE TALKED TO SAID THEY HAD  TO BE HERE TODAY. I TALKED TO FAMILIES WHO CAME IN FROM FAR AND WIDE, ONE FAMILY, A GRANDMOTHER, A MOTHER AND TWO  DAUGHTERS PACKED INTO A CAR FROM MINNESOTA AND CAME ALL ACROSS  THE COUNTRY, THEY HAVE NEVER  BEEN TO ANOTHER INAUGURATION AND THEY FELT STRONGLY ABOUT SEEING  PRESIDENT TRUMP. >> IT'S A SLOW MOVING  PROCESSION, BUT THAT'S GREAT, SO EVERYBODY GETS A CHANCE TO SEE  THE PRESIDENT AND EXTEND THEIR  GREETINGS AS HE COMES BY. >> REALLY THE PARADE GETS  STARTED AFTER IT GETS TO HIS  REVIEWING STAND. >> THIS IS MORE THE PROCESSION  AND HE WILL GO IN WITH THE  FAMILY FROM THE VIEWING STAND  AND WATCH. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE  RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THIS  PRESIDENT AND THE MEDIA, HUGH  HUET IS BACK WITH US, THERE'S  BEEN A LOT SAID ABOUT TRUMP'S  RELATIONSHIP WITH THE MEDIA, IS  THAT IMPORTANT? >> I THOUGHT IT WAS THE MOST  TRUMPIAN THING OF THE DAY. A LOT OF ONE-ON-ONES WITH THE  NEW PRESIDENT, HE CAN BE QUITE  CHARMING, HE CAN BE QUITE  GRACIOUS, IT WASN'T IN THE  OFFICIAL SPEECH, BUT HE CALLED  FOR THE AUDIENCE TO RECOGNIZE  FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA AND  SECRETARY OF STATE CLINTON. BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN OFFERED  JOBS, HE'S DOMINATING THE ROOM  AND COMPLETELY IN COMMAND OF  THIS TRANSITION PROCESSION,  WHICH IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT  FROM THE FORMER DONALD. I THINK A LITTLE BIT OF  SPEECHWRITER TOOK OVER A LITTLE  BIT TODAY. >> YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THICK  SKIN, THIN SKINNED, HE TENDS TO  REACT TO EVERYTHING THAT IS SAID AS NEGATIVE AS UNFAIR. DOES THAT BY NECESSITY CHANGE  WHEN YOU BECOME THE PRESIDENT  AND YOU TAKE A LOT OF GRIEF? >> I WENT TO WORK FOR RICHARD  NIXON AND HE NEVER WATCHED ANY  COVERAGE OF HIMSELF. AND I THINK THE TWITTER AGE HAS  MADE THE INCOMING RELENTLESS  24/7, AND MUCH MORE THAN YOU  WOULD HAVE GOTTEN FROM THE  NETWORKS, YOU COULD HIT PRETTY  HARD IF YOU WERE SAM DONALDSON,  BUT ALL OF US GET HIT ON  TWITTER. IF YOU JUST SNEAK A PEEK, THE  INCOMING IS AWFUL. >> HE KNOWS, YOU CONTINUE TO DO  THIS, YOU BEAT UP MAYBE AN  INDIVIDUAL MEMBER OF THE PRESS  AND YOU KEEP DOING IT. AND MAYBE THAT MEMBER OF THE  PRESS SAYS MAYBE I DON'T WANT TO SAY THIS TODAY BECAUSE I DON'T  WANT TO HAVE A FIGHT WITH HIM. HE'S DONE THIS FOR YEARS, DONE  THIS IN THE TABLOIDS AND ALL  THIS SORT OF STUFF, THIS IS A  STRATEGY. THIS IS ONE OF HIS TACTICS AND  IT HAS WORKED FOR HIM. >> I KNOW THE CAMPAIGN WAS NOT  PARTICULARLY SATISFIED WITH HIS  PRESS COVERAGE.  >> HE DIDN'T WIN BECAUSE HE  BULLIED KATY TUR AT THOSE  RALLIES, HE WON DESPITE THOSE  THINGS. THEY AT MIRE THAT HE'S COMBATIVE WITH THE MEDIA, BECAUSE THEY  THINK HE'S STICKING UP FOR  HIMSELF. BUT I HAVEN'T MET ANYBODY THAT  LIKES OR APPROVES OF THE  PERSONAL HARASSMENT OF  INDIVIDUALS. IF YOU ARE A HOME TEAM AND YOU  SINGLE OUT FEMALE REPORTERS,  EVEN IF THEY VOTED FOR HIM. >> IT'S JUST THE -- LOOK, I HAVE HAD THIS CONVERSATION WITH HIM,  I WAS LIKE BASH US COLLECTIVELY, NOT INDIVIDUALLY. YOU'RE CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT  THAT'S UNNECESSARY FOR THAT  PERSON,BASH UP SELECTIVELY AND  HE STILL GETS HIS POINT ACROSS. EVEN HIS SUPPORTERS SAY THEY  DON'T LIKE THE INDIVIDUAL  ATTACKS, BUT IT SENDS THE  COLLECTIVE MESSAGE THAT I GO  BACK TO WHAT A TRUMP SUPPORTER  SAID IN IOWA RIGHT AFTER THE  STATE FAIR. HE SAID YOU KNOW WHAT? HE'S MY MIDDLE FINGER TO ALL OF  YOU. AND SO DONALD TRUMP IS WILLING  TO DO THAT, SO HIM GETTING MAD  AT ME, IT'S LIKE HEY, RIGHT ON. HE'S IZED FOR TWO YEARS. >> I WILL TELL YOU SEVERAL YEARS AGO, I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO  MODERATE A PANEL DISCUSSION WITH WALTER CRONKITE. I REMEMBER HIM TELLING A STORY  THAT A OF STAFFER CAME IN AND  SAID THAT LINDEN JOHNSON IS ON  PHONE. >> BUT YOU BROUGHT UP THE EXACT  PRESIDENT THAT WHEN IT COMES TO  MEDIA OBSESSION, LBJ COULDN'T  STOP WATCHING TELEVISION, YOU  SAID NIXON NEVER WANTED TO SEE  IT, HE GOT THE TELEVISIONS  RIPPED OUT, PROBABLY DAY ONE. GUESS WHO'S PROBABLY GETTING  THEM INSTALLED IN THAT SIDE  OFFICE, AND PROBABLY MULTIPLE  TVs. >> WHAT DID NIXON TELL YOU IN  HIS FINAL ADDRESS? THOSE WHO HATE YOU DON'T WIN  UNLESS YOU HATE THEM. THEN YOU DESTROY THEM. WHAT NIXON WAS SAYING I GOT IN  TOO MANY OF THESE FIGHTS THAT I  DID NOT NEED TO AND WERE NOT IN  MY INTERESTS. >> THAT'S WHY A LOT OF PEOPLE  WERE FRUSTRATED WITH HIM. INCLUDING MANY DEMOCRATS, WHY  GET INTO A FIGHT WITH JOHN  LEWIS, THERE WERE SOME DEMOCRATS THAT WEREN'T HAPPY WITH WHAT HE  SAID, BUT WHY ELEVATE THE FIGHT? >> GEORGE W. BUSH WOULD NEVER  HAVE ENGAGED IN A WAR OF WORDS  WITH --  >> WOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT BECAUSE THAT'S HIS WAY, ALSO BECAUSE HE  KNEW YOU ENGAGE AND IT PROBABLY  MULTIPLIES THE NUMBER OF  DEMOCRATS THAT ARE NOT GOING TO  COME TO THE INAUGURATION. >> GEORGE W. BUSH NEVER  ATTACKED, IT WAS NOT IN HIS  STYLE. >> THE PRESIDENT HAS APPARENTLY  REACHED A POINT WHERE HE'S IN  SIGHT OF SOME OF THE PROTESTERS, WHAT WOULD HE BE SEEING RIGHT  NOW? >> Reporter: WE'RE SEEING OUR  FIRST SIGNS AGAINST PRESIDENT  TRUMP, ONE SAYING DEFEAT  FASHIONISM, BLACK LIGHTS MATTER, AND ANOTHER ONE THAT SAYS TRUMP, YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF YOU. SOME PEOPLE CHANTING TRUMP, SOME PEOPLE BOOING, THIS IS WHAT  DEMOCRY SOUNDS LIKE ALONG THE  PARADE ROUTE, THE CROWD HAS  GOTTEN ABOUT FIVE DEEP RIGHT  NOW. WE'RE REALLY IN THE THICK OF IT  NOW AND YOU CAN HEAR THEM BOOING AS WE PASS. SO PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GETTING TO THE PROTESTERS, BUT AS FAR AS I  CAN SEE, THESE ARE PEACEFUL  PROTESTERS THAT WE KNEW WAS  COMING, AND YOU HAVE A WHOLE  GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING  TO DROWN THEM OUT BY CHANTING  USA, WE'RE NOT TOO FAR AWAY FROM THE WHITE HOUSE, BUT PRESIDENT  TRUMP AGAIN TAKING THIS HISTORIC ROUTE THAT THE FIRST PRESIDENT  TOOK, OF COURSE THE FIRST  PRESIDENT TOOK A VERY DIFFERENT  PATH, HE WENT TO NEW YORK, HE  WAS SWORN IN IN NEW YORK AND  THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT LOOKING PARADE. BUT AGAIN, PRESIDENT TRUMP, YOU  CAN HEAR THE CROWD SHOUTING AS  HE PASSES AND WE'RE PASSING THE  NATIONAL ARCHIVES RIGHT NOW,  LESTER. SO YOU CAN HEAR THE CROWD  GETTING A LOT BIGGER AND A LOT  MORE ENERGIZED. >> VERY INTERESTING AS YOU SPOKE AND WE HEARD THE CROWD SWELL, WE SAW MORE SECRET SERVICE KIND OF  RUSH UP TO THE SIDE OF THE  VEHICLE, WE DON'T KNOW IF THIS  SUGGESTS HE'S GOING TO COME OUT. MAYBE NOT. BUT CERTAINLY THE CROWD IS --  WELL, LET'S LISTEN. >> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  MICHAEL PENCE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] [ CHANTING ] >> A BIG BARRICADE BETWEEN  SPECTATORS AND THE PRESIDENTIAL  MOTORCADE PROCESSION, YOU CAN  SEE LOTS OF MEMBERS OF MILITARY  POLICE THERE AND THEN THE STEEL  BARRICADES AND THEN FOLKS, AND  YOU CAN SEE THE VARIOUS SIGNS  THERE, THIS IS AROUND THE NAVY  MEMORIAL, THERE ARE SOME SIGNS  AND PROTESTS, BUT AS YOU HEAR,  THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE  CHANTING, TRUMP, TRUMP. >> THIS IS THE SOUND OF  DEMOCRACY. >> A LOT OF VOICES. >> THE PRESIDENT GETS INTO  BUBBLES, THEY'RE EXPOSE TO THIS, NOT EVERY HOUR OF EVERY DAY, BUT PRIME. >> YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THE SIGNS AND SEE WHERE PEOPLE STAND. >> THAT WOULD BE THE NAVAL  MEMORIAL AREA THEY'RE PASSING BY RIGHT NOW, SHOULD BE COMING UP  FAIRLY SHORTLY ON THE HOTEL. >> THEY ARE GETTING THERE, YEAH. >> AT SOME POINT, THERE WILL  CROWD SIZE, THEY HAVE VARIED  ANYWHERE FROM 1.1 MILLION WHEN  BARACK OBAMA WAS INAUGURATED. >> YOU MAY SEE A SWELL. >> IN THIS TOWN, IN THIS REGION, WE'RE NOT INCREDIBLY SUPPORTIVE. >> AND YOU HEAR A LOT OF THINGS  ABOUT PROTESTS, I KNOW IN  CLEVELAND THERE WAS A LOT OF  COVERAGE ABOUT PROTESTS, AND IT  WAS A LOVELY TIME IN CLEVELAND,  VERY, VERY SAFE. BUT IF YOU'RE AFRAID THERE ARE  GOING TO BE PROTESTS AND YOU'VE  GOT KIDS. >> I FLEW INTO REAGAN LAST  NIGHT, AND THE MEMORIAL BRIDGE  WAS CLOSED AND SO WE CAME  DOWNTOWN AND YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH THIS ANYMORE. >> I MAY HAVE VENTED A BIT. BUT WHEN THERE'S A LOT OF  TRAFFIC. >> YOU WERE DRIVING ENRAGED. >> I WAS NOT MOVING.  >> AND YOU WERE STOPPED IN  TRAFFIC AND THERE WERE UPDATES  AT EVERY INTERSECTION. >> I DO THINK THERE'S SOMETHING  TO THAT, THIS POST-9/11  SECURITY. WE SECURE THESE EVENTS SO MUCH,  IT ACTUALLY DOES, I THINK  DISCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GO TO BIG  EVENTS. >> I THINK THAT'S FAIR, WE COVER A LOT OF BIG EVENTS AND EVEN  WITH THE PRESS CREDENTIALS, THE  HASSLE FACTOR IS HIGH.  >> AND WE HAVE QUICKER WAYS TO  GET IN. >> AND I'M NOT SEEING IN THIS  SHOT, PORT-A-POTTIES. >> THERE WERE MORE ON THE MALL  THAT WERE VISIBLE THAN ON THIS  PARADE. >> IT SEEMS LIKE THE MARINE  CORPS MARATHON WAS MORE HEAVILY  ATTENDED THAN THIS. YOU COULD PARK ON THE ROAD, YOU  COULD GO ANYWHERE. AND THE CITY'S GOT IT HARD TO  NAVIGATE AROUND. >> THERE WE GO. SOMEONE'S GETTING OUT. OR THEY THINK SOMEONE'S GETTING  OUT. OR THEY'RE PREPARING. >> THEY'RE GETTING NEAR THE  HOTEL. >> IS THAT PENCE'S? >> I'M NOT SURE. >> THE MOST IMPORTANT THING, IS  ROKER READY? >> I FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD HAVE  SWEETENED THE POT FOR HIM. >> THERE'S A SUGGESTION HERE WE  MAY SEE THE PRESIDENT. LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] >> LET'S TAKE IN THIS MOMENT, IF WE CAN. . [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] . >> IT'S NICE TO SEE THEIR  SMILES. THEY'RE TAKING IT IN. >> THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO WAS A CANDIDATE, HE MADE IT CLEAR HE  LOVED BIG CROWDS. AND THEY DON'T GET MUCH BIGGER  THAN THIS, OR THEY HAVEN'T  GOTTEN MUCH BIGGER THAN THIS FOR HIM. HIS SON BARRON. FIRST LADY MELANIA TRUMP. >> IT'S SO IMPRESSIVE WHEN THE  KIDS GET IN ON IT AND SEEM TO  KNOW WHAT TO DO. >> HE'S BEEN TERRIFIC TODAY. I MEAN THIS IS NOT EASY FOR  ANYBODY, ADOLESCENCE AND ALL  THOSE THINGS. >> KRISTEN WELKER, ARE YOU  SEEING THIS FROM WHERE YOU ARE? >> Reporter: YES, I AM, AND THIS IS THE SIGHT SO MANY PEOPLE IN  THIS CROWD WERE WAITING FOR AND  THEY GOT THEIR MOMENT. SO WE ARE JUST PAST TRUMP HOTEL. SO HE GOT OUT JUST BEFORE THE  HOTEL. THE CROWD JUST ERUPTED WHEN THE  FIRST FAMILY GOT OUT AND STARTED WAVING. AS YOU POINT OUT, PRESIDENT  DONALD TRUMP LOVES THESE  MOMENTS. YOU COULD FEEL HOW ENERGIZED  THEY WERE WHEN THEY GOT OUT OF  THE CAR. SO AMOUNT OF EXCITEMENT. AND AS I JUST MENTIONED, WE JUST PASSED PROTESTERS, AND SO WE  HEAR PEOPLE CHEERING FOR THE  PRESIDENT. WHEN HE GETS IN OFFICE, HE'S  GOING TO BE FOCUSED ON THINGS  LIKE TRADE, IMMIGRATION AND  HEALTH CARE, AS A PART OF THE  FIRST ACTIONS HE TAKES, WE MAY  SEE SOME OF THAT UNFOLD AS EARLY AS MONDAY, BUT RIGHT NOW, HE'S  SOAKING UP THE ENERGY OF ALL  THESE SUPPORTERS THAT HAVE COME  OUT TO CHEER HIM ON, TO HELP  CELEBRATE THE FACT THAT HE'S NOW THE 45th PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. >> IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S GOING BACK TO THE CAR, BUT TAMRON HALL IS  IN THE FRONT OF THE HOTEL, WERE  FOLKS EXPECTED TO BEING ABLE TO  VISIT THAT HOTEL? >> Reporter: WE WERE SITTING  HERE AND THE PRESIDENT STOPPED  FOR A SECOND, HE SEEMED TO  SIGNAL TO THE FIRST LADY THAT WE WERE GETTING BACK IN THE CAR. AND HERE'S THE THING HERE, WE  ARE RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE HOTEL, THERE'S A HUGE GROUP  OF PROTESTERS COMBINED WITH  SUPPORTERS AND THEY HAVE BEEN  VERY VOCAL AND SO WE'RE NOT SURE WHAT'S GOING ON, WE'RE NOT CLEAR IF THIS WAS THE PLAN TO GET BACK IN THE CAR, IF YOU LOOK AT THE  BODY LANGUAGE OF THE SECRET  SERVICE AROUND HIM, HIS  EMPLOYEES AT TRUMP INTERNATIONAL HOTEL ARE ALSO SURPRISED, THEY  HAD THEIR SIGNS, THEY STARTED  CHANTING USA, THEY WERE MOVING  IN A WAY THEY WERE READY TO BE  GREETED BY THE PRESIDENT. AND THERE IS A CHANGE OF PLANS  NOW, I BELIEVE. HE'S BACK IN HIS VEHICLE, HE  EVEN WALKED TOWARD WHERE THE  MEDIA STAND IS RIGHT NOW, GIVING A THUMBS-UP. IT'S NOT CLEAR IF THE PRESIDENT  HAD PLANNED TO WALK A LONGER  DISTANCE. WE'RE ABOUT 50 YARDS AWAY FROM  WHERE HE ORIGINALLY GOT OUT OF  THE VEHICLE, THEY WALKED A VERY  SHORT DISTANCE AND THEN SEEMED  TO ABRUPTLY GET BACK INSIDE. SO WE MAY LEARN MORE ABOUT WHAT  THE PLAN WAS OR IF IT CHANGED. BUT YOU SEE THE VEHICLE HERE,  THE PRESIDENT NOW IS PASSING,  AGAIN, THIS SIZABLE -- LISTEN TO THE BOOS A LITTLE BIT. SO THERE'S A LARGE GROUP OF  PROTESTERS HE'S PASSING RIGHT  NOW, A NUMBER OF SIGNS THAT WE  HAVE SEEN, FAMILIAR SIGNS, DUMP  TRUMP, ET CETERA, BUT NOW HE'S  PAST HIS HOTEL, AND NOW HE'S  GOING PAST THIS HUGE GROUP OF  PROTESTERS THAT ARE ASSEMBLED. >> THEY DID SEEM TO GET BACK  INTO THEIR CAR AFTER JUST A  SHORT TIME WALKING, BUT THE  CROWD OBVIOUSLY TAKING IN THAT  MOMENT AND GETTING A GOOD LOOK  AT THE PRESIDENT AS HE MAKES HIS WAY PAST --  >> THEY MAY HAVE TO GET INTO H  CAR WHERE HE GETS AROUND  TREASURY. BUT THAT TURN IS STILL TO COME,  AND THEN HE GETS BACK OUT.  >> A BROKER CORNER. >> YOU MAY CALL IT PENNSYLVANIA  AVENUE. WE CALL IT ROKER CORNER. >> HE'S NOT STANDING THERE FOR  NOTHING. >> BUT IT IS QUITE A SITE. WHAT AN AMAZING DAY THIS HAS  BEEN, A NEW PRESIDENT TAKING THE OATH OF OFFICE, HIS SPEECH, THE  LUNCHEON AND NOW THIS PARADE. WE KNOW THIS IS MORE OF A  PROCESSION THAN THE PARADE, ONCE THEY GET TO THE WHITE HOUSE, THE FIRST FAMILY WILL RE-EMERGE IN  THE VIEWING STAND AND THEN WATCH THE ACTUAL PARADE GO BY AND IT  IS CONSIDERABLY SHORTER THAN  SOME WE HAVE SEEN IN PAST  INAUGURATIONS, SO HOPEFULLY  BEFORE SUNSET IT WILL BE OVER. >> THERE'S ACTUALLY SOME  ACTIVITY GOING ON AT THE WHITE  HOUSE, RIGHT? >> THEY ARE FEVERISHLY WORKING. >> JACKIE SAID THAT THE FIRST  COUPLE OF DAYS THAT SHE AND JOHN WERE IN THE WHITE HOUSE, THEY  THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO  SUFFOCATE FROM THE PAINT. >> AND THE STAFF IS PROBABLY  MOVING INTO THEIR OFFICES, THE  LIGHTS GETTING TURNED ON, E-MAIL ACCOUNTS GETTING ACTIVATED. >> IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU WALK  BY AND SOMEONE IS STILL PACKING? >> I THINK THEY HAVE GOT SOME  GOOD PROTOCOLS IN PLACE SO THAT  THE OBAMA STAFF IS OUT BEFORE  THE CEREMONY. THE STAFF GETS THEIR BLACKBERRYS TODAY. SO THE STAFF IS -- WHEN I WORKED FOR GEORGE W. BUSH, I DIDN'T  WATCH THE PARADE, I WAS IN THE  WEST WING WORKING.  >> AND THE PERMANENT STAFF  DOWNSTAIRS, THE CLERK, THE WEST  WING STAFF, THEY'RE PERMANENTLY  THERE, THEY ARE THE ONES THAT  ARE ACTUALLY SHOULDERING THE  BURDEN OF THIS TRANSITION, NOT  THE POLITICAL PEOPLE WHO CAN'T  FIND THE BATHROOMS YET. >> IT'S LIKE THAT FOR A MONTH. >> FOR A MONTH. >> AND EVEN WHITEHOUSE.GOV IS  ACTIVE. >> THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO  OBVIOUSLY ADORES HIS PENTHOUSE  AS TRUMP TOWER IN NEW YORK AND  HAS ENJOYED THE PARADE OF  VISITORS GOING UP AND DOWN THE  ELEVATOR. >> I IMAGINE HE'LL GO BACK. A LOT OF PEOPLE COME HERE  THINKING, YEAH, I'LL GO HOME A  LOT. >> PRESIDENT OBAMA THOUGHT HE  WOULD. >> HE WENT ONCE, REALIZED WHAT  AN ORDEAL HE WAS CAUSING ALL HIS NEIGHBORS AND BASICALLY NEVER, I DON'T THINK SPENT ANOTHER NIGHT  THERE. >> NOT OVERNIGHT. >> DO YOU EXPECT THEM TO BE A  CAMP DAVID PRESIDENT, MICHAEL? >> I THINK YOU HEARD DONALD  TRUMP'S QUOTE ON CAMP DAVID,  IT'S VERY NICE BUT ONLY FOR  ABOUT 30 MINUTES. SO MY GUESS IS THIS IS A CITY  GUY WHO'S NOT GOING IS TO BE  VERY HAPPY. >> YOU MIGHT GET MIKE PENCE. >> KRISTEN WELKER, HAS THE  MOTORCADE REACHED YOU? CRAIG, CRAIG MELVIN. WELL, CRAIG IS TAKING IT IN AS  WELL. WE'LL GET BACK TO HIM A LITTLE  BIT LATER. YOU SEE SOME MORE OF THE VIEW,  WE HAVE SOME STANDS ALONG THE  SIDE IS THICKER. >> THE REASON WHY ALL OF THIS  LOOKS QUITE NICE, BACK TO THE  KENNEDYS, WHEN THEY WERE COMING  DOWN PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE AFTER  JOHN KENNEDY WAS SWORN IN IN  1961, ALONG A LOT OF  PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE, YOU SAW  SLEAZY ESTABLISHMENTS AND SIOUX  NEAR STORES AND IT WAS QUITE  UGLY AND BOTH JOHN AND  JACQUELINE SAID THIS IS NOT  REALLY AN AVENUE THAT'S FIT FOR  A NEW PRESIDENT, SO THEY WORKED  VERY HARD TO BEGIN THE  REDEVELOPMENT THAT LED TO WHAT  YOU SEE HERE. >> A GOVERNMENT ENTITY TOOK IT  OVER. >> SOMETIMES GOVERNMENTS WORKS. >> ALL OF DOWNTOWN D.C., THE  TRANSFORMATION THAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST 25 YEARS TO BE  HONEST, FIRST IT WAS JUST  PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE THAT WAS  FIXED, BUT THE WHOLE SURROUNDING AREA, IT'S BEEN TRANSFORMED WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE CITY I MOVED  TO IN 1990 AND WHAT IT LOOKS  LIKE TODAY.  >> I BELIEVE THAT'S THE VISITOR  CENTER FOR THE WHITE HOUSE. >> I BELIEVE IT IS. >> NOW THERE'S A TURN THAT TAKES THEM ON --  >> IT WILL BE 15th. >> THEY'LL GO BY THE TREASURY  DEPARTMENT. >> CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE UNITED  STATES JOHN G. ROBERTS. THE HONORABLE JUSTICE ANTHONY M. KENNEDY. >> WE'RE HEAR THE HOWEVER. I ASSUME IT'S FOR PEOPLE SITTING IN THE REVIEWING STAND.  >> YEAH, I THINK THAT'S THE  REVIEWING STAND WE'RE HEARING. >> KRISTEN WELKER CAN GIVE US A  LITTLE BIT BETTER VIEW, SHE'S IN ONE OF THE FLATBED VEHICLES  RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE  PRESIDENT'S VEHICLE. KRISTEN? >> Reporter: LESTER, WE'RE JUST  ABOUT TO PASS THE TREASURY  BUILDING, AND I CAN TELL YOU  THAT THE CROWDS CONTINUE TO  CHEER AS WE GET MUCH CLOSER TO  THE WHITE HOUSE. WE'RE ALMOST THERE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT STRUCK ME WHEN WE CONTINUE TO PASS  PROTESTERS, HOW MANY OF THEM ARE HOLDING SIGNS ABOUT RUSSIA IN  PARTICULAR, IT'S CLEAR THAT THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE CONTINUES TO  RESONATE WITH PEOPLE, THERE'S  ALLEGATIONS THAT RUSSIA TRIED TO MEDDLE IN THIS ELECTION, YOU  HAVE PRESIDENT TRUMP MAKING WHAT SOME SAY ARE VERY PRAISE WORTHY  COMMENTS ABOUT PRESIDENT PUTIN. SO THIS IS SOMETHING CLEARLY  HE'S GOING TO BE DEALING WITH IN THE FIRST DAYS OF HIS  PRESIDENCY, CLEARLY GOING TO BE  ANSWERING A LOT OF TOUGH  QUESTIONS ABOUT, THE PROTESTERS  VERY MUCH A PART OF THIS PARADE  ROUTE, AND AS WE'RE GETTING  CLOSER TO THE WHITE HOUSE, WE'RE SEEING MORE OF HIS SUPPORTERS  AND THE PROTESTERS FADING OFF  INTO THE BACKGROUND. THE CROWD FALLING MORE SILENT AS THEY LISTEN TO THE ANNOUNCER  WELCOME THEM AS WE'RE JUST A FEW BLOCKS AWAY FROM THE WHITE HOUSE RIGHT NOW.  >> AND WHEN THEY ENTER THE WHITE HOUSE, THEY WILL RE-EMERGE,  CORRECT? >> Reporter: THE UNDERSTANDING  IS ONCE THEY GET TO THE WHITE  HOUSE, THEY MAY GET OUT AND WALK THOSE FINAL STEPS, WE'LL SEE IF  THEY'LL DO THAT, BUT ONCE HE  GOES TO THE WHITE HOUSE, HE WILL LIKELY WALK THROUGH THE WHITE  HOUSE, AND THEN COME OUT AGAIN,  WALK ALONG THE LAWN THERE AND  THEN GO TO THE REVIEWING STAND  AND THAT IS WHERE HE WILL WATCH  THE REST OF THE PARADE AND THE  FESTIVITIES THIS AFTERNOON. IT IS ONE OF THE GREAT  TRADITIONS. FOUR YEARS AGO, OF COURSE,  PRESIDENT OBAMA AND THE FIRST  FAMILY DID THE SAME THING AND  YOU'LL RECALL, THEY'RE ALL OF  THOSE MEMORABLE MOMENTS SNAPPED  BETWEEN MALIA AND SASHA AND NOW  A NEW FAMILY WITH KIDS AND  GRANDKIDS WILL BE WITNESSING ALL OF THAT FROM THE REVIEWING  STAND, LESTER. >> WE CONTINUE TO WATCH THIS  MOTORCADE, THIS PROCESSION AND  IT WILL BE FOLLOWED BY THE  PARADE, AS WE WATCH THIS, LET'S  TALK ABOUT THE FIRST ORDER OF  BUSINESS. WE KNOW THE PRESIDENT ON MONDAY  IS GOING TO SIGN SOME EXECUTIVE  ORDERS IN HIS FIRST FEW DAYS. AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, HOW QUICKLY WILL HE MOVE ON THERE? >> THAT'S GOING TO BE MORE OF A  CONGRESSIONAL ACT. BUT HEALTH CARE IS SORT OF THE  IMMEDIATE CONGRESSIONAL  CHALLENGE. IT'S ON IMMIGRATION, I THINK  EVEN A FEW POTENTIAL TRADE  THINGS, THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE  GOING TO SEE THE FIRST, SORT OF  ACTIONABLE ITEMS THAT THEY DO ON DAY ONE. >> WE SHOWED YOU A PROTEST THAT  GOT A BIT OUT OF HAND A FEW  BLOCKS AWAY FROM THIS, BUT THIS  IS A LIMO THAT'S BEEN SET ON  FIRE. POLICE DID HAVE TO USE PEPPER  SPRAY TO TRY TO CONTAIN THE  CROWD, THEY WERE USING FLASH  BANG GRENADES, WE SHOWED SOME OF THAT TO YOU LIVE, BUT THIS WAS  SOME TAPE FROM A SHORT WHILE AGO OF THE FIRE DEPARTMENT  RESPONDING TO A VEHICLE FIRE,  APPARENTLY RELATED TO SOME OF  THE PROTESTS. UP TO 95 PEOPLE, MAYBE MORE NOW, THERE WERE SOME POLICE OFFICERS  THAT MAY HAVE RECEIVED INJURIES. WE CAN TELL YOU THE PROTESTS  THAT WE AND OUR CORRESPONDENTS  ALONG THIS ROUTE HAVE BEEN VOCAL BUT MOSTLY PEACEFUL. AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL REMAIN SO AS THE MOTORCADE GETS CLOSER  TO THE FIRST FAMILY'S NEW HOME,  THE WHITE HOUSE. >> WE GOT SOME COMPLAINTS ABOUT  SOME OF THE EMPTY BLEACHERS, BUT THEY BELIEVE IT'S BECAUSE THE  LUNCHEON RAN LATE AND IT CAUSED  SOME INVITED GUESTS NOT TO GET  THERE ON TIME. THERE ARE A WHOLE LOT OF  REASONS. >> IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A  MEASURE OF THE SUCCESS OF THIS  PRESIDENT. >> THE TURN. >> THERE IS THE TURN. THAT'S TREASURY BEHIND YOU  THERE. ON TO PENNSYLVANIA. >> ALL RIGHT, DOES HE GET OUT  ONE MORE TIME? BECAUSE WE ARE ON ROKER CORNER. >> THAT'S RIGHT. >> THIS IS THE STANDARD PLACE IN MODERN TIMES THAT PRESIDENTS GET OUT TO WALK. >> IT'S A LITTLE MORE SECURE  HERE. >> AND HERE WE GO. THE CAR IS --  >> AND ALSO AL IS THERE. >> WITH SNICKERS. >> THEY SLOWED DOWN A LITTLE  BIT. >> YEAH. >> AND THERE'S AL ROKER, WAITING FOR HIS MOMENT. HELLO, AL. >> Reporter: HEY, GUYS. >> NO PRESSURE. >> Reporter: BY THE WAY, I'M  PREPARED. I'M READY. >> WHO COULD PASS YOU? >> I THINK YOU GOT A GOOD SHOT  WITH PENCE, FOR SURE. I THINK HE'S GOT A LITTLE  CHOCOLATE ADDICTION. HERE WE GO. >> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE  PRESIDENT'S MOTORCADE HAS MADE  THE TURN ON TO PENNSYLVANIA  AVENUE. >> CROWD REACTING. 3 C3 ESTOY REACCIONANDO  >> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE  45th OF THE UNITED STATES,  DONALD J. TRUMP, AND THE FIRST  LADY, MELANIA TRUMP. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] . [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] >> THERE WILL BE RARE  OPPORTUNITIES IN THE NEXT FOUR  YEARS FOR THEY AS A FAMILY TO  TAKE A STROLL, WITHOUT THIS KIND OF COMMOTION. >> THOSE DAYS OF STROLLING  WITHOUT COMMOTION ARE OVER FOR  THIS FAMILY. THAT'S ONE THING YOU GIVE UP. >> THE REST OF THE TRUMP  CHILDREN NOW HAVE JOINED, ALONG  WITH BARRON. >> SHOULD WE LOWER THE BALL FOR  ROKER AND SAY IF YOU CAN GET ANY TRUMP? I UNDERSTAND IT'S HARD TO GET  THE PRESIDENT TO COME OVER. >> LOWER THE DEGREE OF  DIFFICULTY. >>.  >> Reporter: NICE. >> I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU OUT. >> Reporter: NICE, CHUCK, WITH  FRIENDS LIKE YOU --  >> I THINK ANY FAMILY MEMBER IS  A HOME RUN. >> TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP! >> THE KIDS ARE SO IMPRESSED,  THEY DON'T RUN FOR OFFICE. >> ESPECIALLY THE LITTLE ONES,  THE GRANDCHILDREN AND BARRON,  THEY'RE JUST HANDLING THEMSELVES SO WELL. >> IN BACK. >> I'M JUST NOTICING DON JR.  CARRYING HIS LITTLE GIRL. THAT'S EXTRA DUTY. >> DONE WALKING, MAN, THAT'S IT. >> I CAN'T TELL IF THEY'RE GOING BACK TO THEIR VEHICLE OR IF  THEY'RE GOING BACK TO THE CROWD. >> IS KRISTEN STILL IN FRONT OF  THEM? >> KRISTEN ARE YOU ON THAT SITE? CAN YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING? >> Reporter: I CAN'T SEE THAT  FAR BACK, LESTER. BUT IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THEY'RE  STILL GREETING THE CROWD, THAT'S MY SENSE OF IT. AT THIS POINT IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THE CARS HAVE COME TO A COMPLETE STOP AND THAT THEY HAVE PAUSED. SO BY MY COUNT, AL ROKER HAS A  VERY GOOD SHOT, MY MONEY'S ON  AL. IT IS WORTH NOTING, LESTER,  THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SEATS THAT ARE EMPTY HERE AND THEY ARE  SAYING IT'S BECAUSE OF THE  LUNCHEON, BUT CERTAINLY NOT THE  CROWD THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS  HOPING FOR, LESTER. >> I CAN'T REALLY SEE NOW ON  THIS SHOT WHETHER THEY'RE BACK  IN THE VEHICLE. I SEE SOME CAR DOORS OPENING. BUT I CAN'T SEE THE PRESIDENT. >> I THOUGHT THEY GOT BACK IN,  BUT I'M WITH YOU, IT LOOKED LIKE THEY DID GO BACK IN. >> AL, I KNOW THEY STOPPED SHORT OF WHERE YOU ARE. >> Reporter: WE CAN'T QUITE SEE  IT. WE THOUGHT MAYBE THEY WERE GOING OVER TO THE CROWD. BUT AT THIS MOMENT, I DON'T HAVE EYES ON THE PRESIDENT OR THE  FIRST LADY. BUT THE VEHICLES ARE STILL  STOPPED RIGHT WHERE WE ARE. THEY'RE STARTING TO MOVE NOW  VERY SLOWLY. BUT I CAN'T TELL WHETHER THEY'RE INSIDE OR NOT. >> WE'RE LOOKING AT, I BELIEVE  THAT ONE WAS THE ONE THAT WAS  CARRYING THE PRESIDENT. I'LL KNOW WHEN I SEE THE LICENSE PLATE. THAT'S NUMBER ONE. SO THAT'S IT. >> THE PRESIDENT WILL NOW  PROCEED TO THE PRESIDENTIAL  VIEWING STAND. HE'S ALMOST HERE, KEEP YOUR EYES PEELED. >> STILL GOT MIKE PENCE TO COME. SO AL'S DAY IS NOT DONE. >> USED TO BE ABLE TO DRIVE DOWN THAT STREET. BUT HOW MANY YEARS AGO THAT THEY TURNED IT INTO A --  >> THEY FIRST CLOSED IT AFTER  THE FIRST YEAR AT CHRISTMAS  TIME, THERE WERE THREATS FROM  LIBYA. >> OH, NO. >> I THINK HE WAS POINTING TO  YOU, AL. >> Reporter: I DON'T THINK SO. I WOULD LOVE TO THINK SO, OR HE  WANTED THE CANDY, I'M NOT SURE,  BUT NO SIGHTING. >> WELL, IF HE'S NOT WALKING  PAST YOU, YOU ACTUALLY GET A  PASS. HE'S COME OUT OF THE VEHICLE  TWICE FOR VERY BRIEF WALKS  BEFORE GETTING BACK INTO THE  VEHICLE HERE, THEY WILL MAKE  THEIR WAY INTO THE WHITE HOUSE,  PERHAPS FRESHEN UP A BIT. PROBABLY WANT TO TALK AMONG  THEMSELVES A LITTLE BIT AS A  FAMILY. >> OR WALK INTO THE OVAL OFFICE. AT THIS POINT IN 2001, THIS WAS  WHEN GEORGE W. BUSH AND GEORGE  H.W. BUSH FIRST WALKED INTO THE  OVAL OFFICE TOGETHER AND THE SON WAS THE PRESIDENT AND HE WAS IN  THERE. SO THAT WAS BETWEEN THE  INAUGURATION AND THE PARADE  VIEWING. SO IT'S THE FIRST CHANCE THEY  GET TO CHECK OUT THEIR NEW BIGS. >> AND HE GETS THE BUSTS THAT HE WANTS, AND THE PORTRAITS THAT HE WANTS. >> HE CAN PUT DOWN ANY RUG THAT  HE WANTS. >> WILL HE KEEP THE RESOLUTE  DESK? MOST PRESIDENTS STICKING WITH  IT. >> MOST HAVE. AND HE SAID HE WILL HANG THE  LETTER FROM RICHARD NIXON SAYING THAT IN THE LATE 1980s, MRS.  NIXON PREDICTING THAT DONALD  TRUMP WOULD HAVE A SUCCESSFUL  POLITICAL CAREER.  >> AND CHURCHILL IS BACK, PRETTY QUICKLY, THE BUST OF CHURCHILL  WILL BE BACK. >> PETER, WHAT ARE YOU SEEING  FROM THERE? >> Reporter: LESTER, WE'RE  LOOKING RIGHT DOWN AT THE  PRESIDENT'S VEHICLE RIGHT NOW,  IT'S ALMOST IN FRONT OF THE  VIEWING STAND, OVER THE COURSE  OF THE LAST 30, 45 MINUTES, WE  HAVE SEEN A LOT OF MEMBERS OF  HIS CABINET ARRIVING, AS THE  DOORS OPEN, THE SECRET SERVICE  SURROUND THE BEAST ONE MORE  TIME, A CHANCE TO WALK AND TO  SMILE. WE SAW BEN CARSON, TOM PRICE,  THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES  NOMINEE ARRIVE, AND RICK PERRY  AND SO MANY OTHERS. THESE CROWDS HAVE BEEN WAITING  AND WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT  HOW THEY HAVE BEEN GETTING  SPARSE IN PLACES, BUT IN THE  LAST HALF HOUR, IT'S BEEN  FILLING UP. HE'S COMING OUT TO GREET THESE  INDIVIDUALS, WAVING FOR THE  FIRST TIME, HIS SON BARRON BY  HIS SIDE. AND AS HE LOOKS TO THE LEFT,  HE'LL BE LOOKING AT THE VIEWING  STAND, WHERE SO MANY MEMBERS OF  HIS OWN TEAM ARE THERE TO GREET  HIM AND A SMILE OUT OF HIM AS  WELL. LESTER, WHAT'S STRIKING ABOUT  THIS IS AS THEY'RE ARRIING BACK TODAY THEY HAD SIX HOURS. WHEN I HAVE SPOKEN TO CHIEF  USHERS IN THE PAST, WHEN THE  PRESIDENT WALKS INSIDE, HE'LL  HAVE SNACKS WAITING FOR HIM,  HE'LL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO  PREPARE WITH HIS FAMILY FOR THE  BALLS THAT TAKE PLACE LATER THIS AFTERNOON AND ALSO SEE THE  RESIDENCE FOR THE FIRST TIME AS  THIS PROCESS FINALLY COMPLETES  HIMSELF. LAST NIGHT HE SPENT THE NIGHT AT THE BLAIR HOUSE, TONIGHT HE WILL SLEEP IN THE RESIDENCE, THERE'S  BEEN SOME MISHAPS, IF YOU LOOK  AT MELANIA TRUMP, WHEN HILLARY  CLINTON COULDN'T FIND HER SHOES  FOR INAUGURATION NIGHT. THEY FOUND THEM AT THE LAST  MINUTE IN CHELSEA'S ROOM. >> I CAN PICTURE SOMEONE IN THE  WHITE HOUSE IS, THEY'RE ALMOST  HERE, YOU HAVE TO HURRY. >> THEY ARE PROS, THEY ARE  READY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] >> HE IS NOT MOVING TOWARD THE  CROWD, BUT SIMPLY WALKING ALONG  AND ACKNOWLEDGING PEOPLE WAVING. THIS IS BY THE REVIEWING STAND,  WHICH IS RIGHT OUTSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE. IT'S A GLASSED IN AREA, I THINK  HEATED. AND THAT'S WHERE THE FIRST  FAMILY WILL JOIN SOME OF THEIR  CABINET PICKS, THE MILITARY  LEADERSHIP AND OTHERS TO WATCH  THE PARADE, WHICH WILL BE  GETTING UNDER WAY SHORTLY. IT'S QUITE A STRUCTURE THEY PUT  UP EVERY FOUR YEARS.  >> AND IT'S ALWAYS INTERESTING  TO WATCH WHEN IT STARTS GOING UP SOMEWHERE AROUND NOVEMBER. USUALLY TAKES ALMOST, SOMETIMES  IT'S MARCH BEFORE IT FEELS LIKE  EVERYTHING IS COMPLETELY DOWN  AND --  >> IT'S NOT THAT LONG. >> IT SEEMS LIKE IT.  >> MORE THAN A COUPLE WEEKS.  >> AND THEY USED TO BE DIFFERENT SIZES AND SHAPES, 80 YEARS AGO  TODAY FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT SAID I  WANT MY VIEWING STAND TO BE  BUILT IN HERMITAGE, TENNESSEE  AND SO IT WAS. >> THEY'RE ALL STOPPING HERE  NOW, I GUESS THEY'RE WAITING UP  AT THE REVIEWING STAND ITSELF. THAT'S DR. BEN CARSON. LOOKS LIKE THEY'LL BE DRIVEN  INTO THE WHITE HOUSE ITSELF. IT'S JUST A SHORT DRIVE. MAYBE WE CAN PUT UP A MAP AND  SHOW YOU HOW THEY WILL ENTER THE WHITE HOUSE. THEY WILL HAVE A LITTLE PERSONAL TIME BEFORE COMING BACK TO WATCH THE PARADE ITSELF. WHICH WILL FOLLOW THE SAME ROUTE THEY DID. BUT A LOT OF FOLKS BRAVING KIND  OF A BONE-CHILLING, DAMP DAY  HERE IN WASHINGTON, D.C. TO  WITNESS THIS CHAPTER OF HISTORY, THE NEXT CHAPTER FOR THE UNITED  STATES. . THE INAUGURATION ON A FRIDAY, SO THEY HAVE A NICE WEEKEND. >> THINK FOR SOMEONE LIKE DONALD TRUMP WHO'S SO EAGER TO GET  GOING, IT'S NICE TO HAVE THE  WEEKEND, BUT HE'S PROBABLY EAGER TO GET STARTED. >> I'M SURPRISED HE WANTS TO  TAKE THE WEEKEND. I GOT TO THINK YOU'VE GOT THAT  ANXIOUSNESS. >> I THINK MOST PEOPLE CAN  RELATE TO THAT. GIVE ME A WEEKEND TO --  >> THE WHOLE FAMILY'S HERE, THE  WHOLE FAMILY ISN'T MOVING DOWN  HERE, JUST IVANKA AND JARED. >> THEY'RE COMING IN. >> THAT'S RIGHT THERE AT 17th  AND PENNSYLVANIA, SO THEY'RE  PROBABLY GOING BEHIND -- THEY  HAVE BUILT THIS GIANT, IT LOOKS  MORE LIKE A WAREHOUSE THAN A  GARAGE, WHERE THEY NOW KEEP THE  BEAST. IT'S A GIANT STRUCTURE, YOU  DON'T SEE IT UNTIL ALL OF A  SUDDEN YOU'RE LIKE, HOW DID  THIGH HIDE THAT BEHIND THE WHO  IS -- WHITE HOUSE? >> THEY'RE GOING TO LOOP AROUND  AND COME BACK BEHIND THE WHITE  HOUSE.  >> THE NORTHWEST GATE MUST BE  BLOCKED BY --  >> THEY'LL BE ENTERING THE WEST  WING. AND MAKE THEIR WAY TO THE EAST  WING. THE RESIDENCE --  >> AND THE SCRUM OF  GRANDCHILDREN, I DON'T KNOW HOW  MANY GRANDCHILDREN THERE ARE,  BUT IT LOOKS LIKE A HALF DOZEN  OR EIGHT. H.W. BROUGHT QUITE A LOT OF  GRANDCHILDREN WITH HIM WHEN HE  ARRIVED. BUT IT WILL BE A LOT OF FUN.  >> AND IT'S THEIR HOUSE NOW. THEY WILL BE TOTALLY WELCOME AND INVITED TO DO AS THEY PLEASE. >> THERE'S THE WELCOMING  COMMITTEE OF SERVICE MEMBERS  THERE. >> AND THAT WOODEN PATH HAS BEEN BUILT THAT WAY FOR DECADES,  MAINLY IN CASE IT SNOWS, BUT  THERE'S NOT BEEN THAT MUCH SNOW  AT INAUGURALS THE LAST COUPLE OF DECADES. >> AS WE SAW, MANY OF THE  PROTESTERS ARE HOLDING UP SIGNS  AS IT RELATES TO RUSSIA, AND  THAT WILL CONTINUE TO HOVER  OVER, LIKE A CLOUD OVER THIS  ADMINISTRATION. SO WE HAVE BROUGHT ON AMBASSADOR MICHAEL McPHAUL. GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE. >> THANKS FOR HAVING ME HERE ON  THIS HISTORIC DAY. >> JOHN LEWIS WAS THE FIRST  NOTABLE PERSON TO SUGGEST THERE  WAS A LEGITIMACY QUESTION WITH  THE ELECTION BECAUSE OF RUSSIA. A NUMBER OF PEOPLE OF CONGRESS  BOYCOTTED TODAY BECAUSE OF IT. HOW COMPLICATED ARE THINGS GOING TO BE? THE PRESIDENT OBVIOUSLY IS  CONCERNED ABOUT QUESTIONS ABOUT  HIS LEGITIMACY, BUT HOW  COMPLICATED WILL THE DAY TO DAY  BUSINESS BE WITH RUSSIA? >> YOU HAVE TWO BIG DRAMAS  COMING UP. NUMBER ONE, THERE'S AN ONGOING  INVESTIGATION, IT'S STILL  ONGOING, THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE A NEW CHIEF ADMINISTRATION,  THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEW  ADMINISTRATION THAT'S GOING TO  OVERSEE IT BUT YOU CAN'T STOP  THE INVESTIGATION. AND THE SECOND IS ABOUT POLICY. THERE IS A BIG SET OF  DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN TRUMP AND  SOME OF THE CABINET MEMBERS HAVE VERY DIFFERENT VIEWS OF RUSSIA. LIKE GENERAL MATTIS, HE  DOESN'T -- THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WORK OUT POLICY IN ADDITION  TO THIS SCANDAL THAT IS  LINGERING.  >> SO ANYTHING THAT COULD BE  VIEWED IN RUSSIA'S FAVOR THAT'S  GOING TO BE VIEWED WITH AN EYE  OF SUSPICION? >> THERE'S STILL MANY PEOPLE  THAT STILL BELIEVE THE  CONSPIRACY, AND BELIEVE THAT THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO DO FAVORS  FOR MR. PUTIN. I ACTUALLY BELIEVE IN THE  INTERAGENCY PROCESS, AFTER THEY  SETTLE IN THEIR JOBS, THEY SIT  DOWN IN THE WHITE HOUSE  SITUATION ROOM, AS WE DID. I JOINED THE OBAMA  ADMINISTRATION, THE DAY AFTER  THIS DAY, AFTER SIGNING UP, WE  DID AN INTERAGENCY REVIEW  PROCESS OF RUSSIA AND I SUSPECT  THE OUTCOME OF THAT WILL NOT BE  AS EXTREME IN TERMS OF MR. TRUMP HAS SAID AS A CANDIDATE AND AS  PRESIDENT-ELECT. >> I'M GOING TO READ YOU A LINE  FROM THE INAUGURAL SPEECH. WE WILL SEEK FRIENDSHIP WITH THE NATIONS OF THE WORLD. BUT WE MUST COME TO AN  UNDERSTANDING THAT IT IS THE  RIGHT OF ALL NATIONS TO PUT  THEIR INTERESTS FIRST.  >> WHEN YOU'VE GOT PUTIN, AND  HE'S NOT ALONE, I THINK CHINA  FEELS THIS WAY TOO. WE HAVE OUR SPHERE OF INFLUENCE, YOU'VE GOT YOURS, YOU STAY OUT  OF OUR BUSINESS AND WE'LL STAY  OUT OF YOUR BUSINESS. >> IF YOU ADDED THAT PARAGRAPH  TO THE SPEECH, VLADIMIR PUTIN  WOULD LIKE THAT. IF HE SAID YOU'VE GOT YOUR  SPHERE, I'VE GOT MY SPHERE,  THAT'S WHAT PUTIN WOULD WANT.  >> THE SAME IMPLICATION YOU  DREW, I DREW, WHICH IS A MESSAGE TO THE WORLD THAT IF WE STAY OUT OF EACH OTHER'S WAY, WE'LL BE  FINE. BUT IT DOESN'T PLAY WELL WITH  WHAT WAS SAID ABOUT THE SOUTH  CHINA SEA AND THE ASIAN BUILT  ISLANDS.  >> YOU MEAN SUBSIDIZING FOREIGN  MILITARIES, DOES THAT SEND A  SIGNAL ABOUT NATO.  >> THAT'S NOT GOING TO GO DOWN  WELL AT NATO OR JAPAN OR KOREA. THEY SEE THAT THERE'S BURDEN  SHARING AND THAT LINE IS GOING  TO MAKE THEM NERVOUS. >> BUT HE DID SAY HE WANTED TO  STRENGTHEN SOME ALLIANCES. SO IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR COMFORT THAT HE WON'T SORT OF SCRAMBLE  THE NATO ALLIANCE, YOU CAN GRAB  ON TO THAT. IF YOU'RE NERVOUS ABOUT IT, YOU  GRAB ON TO THE OTHER LINE. >> IF YOU WATCH GENERAL MATTIS  AND HIS CONFIRMATION HEAR, HE  WAS CONFIRMED TODAY.  >> WITHIN A MINUTE OR TWO, HE  AND JOHN KELLY WILL BE  CONFIRMED. >> WHEN DO YOU THINK THE RUBBER  MEETS THE ROAD BETWEEN GENERAL  MATTIS AND DONALD TRUMP? >> VERY, VERY SOON. GENERAL MATTIS IS FROM STANFORD  WHERE I TEACH M WE'RE LOSING HIM FOR A WHILE, BUT I'M SURE HE'LL  COME BACK. YOU HAVE HEARD HIS TESTIMONY,  HIS VIEWS ARE VERY DIFFERENT  THAN WHAT CANDIDATE AND  PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP HAVE BEEN  TALKING ABOUT. BUT I THINK IT HAPPENS IN THAT  FIRST NSC MEETING, WHEN THEY  TALK ABOUT WHAT ARE WE GOING TO  DO, VIS-A-VIS RUSSIA. SO FAR ALL THE PRESIDENT HAS  SAID IS I WANT A GOOD  RELATIONSHIP WITH PUTIN. YOU NEED TO SAY TO DO WHAT? WHAT DO WE WANT OUT OF THIS  RELATIONSHIP? >> WHEN ASKED ABOUT PUTIN  KILLING JOURNALISTS, HE SAYS  WE'RE NOT ALL THAT GREAT EITHER. HE'S GONE OUT OF HIS WAY TO BE  GENEROUS TO PUTIN.  >> I HOPE THAT ALL WILL CHANGE  WHEN HE SITS DOWN IN THE  SITUATION ROOM WITH ALL THOSE  PEOPLE. >> THEY WERE WALKING AT LEAST AS EARLY AS 15th STREET, AND NOW  MAKING THEIR WAY TOWARD THE  WHITE HOUSE ON FOOT. AND MAYBE, JUST MAYBE IN RANGE  OF AL ROKER. >> I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY. >> I THINK HE'S GOT A SHOT. >> Reporter: I CAN SEE HIM IN  THE DISTANCE, HE'S IN THE MIDDLE OF PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE RIGHT  NOW, THEY'RE STILL WALKING. >> I'M GOING TO TEXT MARK RIGHT  NOW. >> HE'S WALKING. >> Reporter: WE HAVE A LOT OF  CHOCOLATE BECAUSE I KNOW THE  VICE PRESIDENT LIKES CHOCOLATE  SO WE'RE GOING WITH THAT. HE'S STILL OUT THERE. >> YOU CAN SEE THE CROWD  SWELLING A LITTLE BIT AS HE  COMES BY. >> Reporter: HE'S WALKING A FAIR BIT, SO HE MAY HAVE WORKED UP AN APPETITE. >> ALL PART OF YOUR PLAN. >> GOT TO HAVE A LITTLE ENERGY. >> Reporter: YEAH. ALL RIGHT, HE'S GETTING CLOSE. YEP. HOLDING HANDS WITH MRS. PENCE,  WALKING WITH THEIR KIDS. >> THERE HE IS, WE SEE HIM ON  YOUR CAMERA NOW. >> Reporter: HE'S GETTING CLOSE. HERE HE COMES. >> LET'S HOPE HE CAN APPRECIATE  INAUGURATION --  >> Reporter: MR. VICE PRESIDENT! MR. VICE PRESIDENT! VICE PRESIDENT PENCE! MR. VICE PRESIDENT! I GOT CANDY! I GOT A SNACK! >> HE GOT HIM. HE'S LOOKING. >> NOTHING, I GUESS I HAD THE  WRONG CANDY. >> HE PAUSED, AL. >> Reporter: HE DIDN'T EVEN  BREAK STRIDE, A COMPLETE BLOW  OFF. >> ONCE AGAIN, THEY CONTINUE TO  BUCK TRADITION. >> Reporter: GIVE ME A BREAK. GIVE ME A BREAK FOR A KITKAT  BAR. >> THANKS FOR TRYING, AL. >> Reporter: ANY TIME. >> IT WAS A UNIQUE MOMENT WHEN  PAUL RYAN TOASTED MIKE PENCE. HE WAS SO WARM AND I THINK HE'LL BE A SIGNIFICANT PLAYER IN THE  NEXT FOUR YEARS. >> WHERE DO YOU SEE MIKE PENCE  FITTING IN? >> EVERYTHING THAT GOES ON THAT  WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED WILL BE  DONE ON THAT RAILROAD RUNNING  BETWEEN PAUL RYAN'S OFFICE --  THE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA RUNS  THROUGH THE VICE PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE. HE'S THAT WELL CONNECTED AND  MUCH BELOVED. >> I THINK EVERYWHERE WHERE A  GENTLE NUDGE HAS BEEN NEEDED FOR DONALD TRUMP TO DIG INTO  SOMETHING DEEPER AND MORE  SUBSTANTIVE, HE'S THE ONE THAT  CAN GO TO HIM AND GET HIM TO  FOCUS ON A KEY APPOINTMENT. I THINK THE ROLE IS BIGGER. AND I THINK IT SURPRISED EVEN  PRESIDENT TRUMP FROM MY  UNDERSTANDING, THAT HE WAS  PICKED FOR SOME OF THE  SUPERFICIAL REASONS THAT WERE IN THE NEWS AT THE TIME, THAT THE  FAMILY FELT VERY COMFORTABLE  WITH HIM. HE LOOKED THE PART. BUT I THINK THEY HAVE DEVELOPED  A VERY GENUINE RELATIONSHIP I  THINK HE RELIES ON HIM  COMPLETELY AND TRUSTS HIM  ENTIRELY. >> WE SAW HIM IN THE VICE  PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE, HE DEFENDED TRUMP, HE WAS PUT IN SOME  DIFFICULT POSITIONS. >> THAT DEBATE I BELIEVE CAME  AFTER SOME OF THE MORE  INFLAMMATORY MOMENTS AND  DIFFICULT MOMENTS. AND VICE PRESIDENT CHENEY HAD  THAT ROLE, THE VICE PRESIDENT  DEBATE CAME AFTER SHELBY BUSH  HAD HAD A VERY CHALLENGING FIRST DEBATE AGAINST JOHN KERRY. IN SOME CYCLES, THE VICE  PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DOESN'T  MATTER VERY MUCH, BUT IN THIS  CASE, IT MATTERED. >> HE HAS BECOME PART OF THE  SORT OF THE NEW MOVEMENT FOR THE 21st CENTURY. PAUL RYAN AND MIKE PENCE PRETTY  MUCH YOU CAN ARGUE GRABBING THE  BATON FROM MARK KENT. MAYBE MORE CONSERVATIVE THAN  SOME OF THE EVANGELICAL. BUT HE'S GOING TO BE THE KEEPER  OF THAT FLAME. IF YOU'RE A SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE  ACTIVIST, YOU'RE GOING THROUGH  MIKE PENCE'S OFFICE. NOW STEVE BANNON IS THE KEEPER  OF THE POPULIST FLAME. THERE ARE DIFFERENT FLAME  KEEPERS SITTING AROUND THE  PRESIDENT. MR. PENCE WILL BE A BIG ONE. >> WE'RE ALSO KEEPING AN EYE ON  WHAT'S GOING ON IN OTHER PARTS  OF WASHINGTON, PROTESTS AND THE  LIKE, LET'S GO TO MIGUEL  ALMAGUER, HE'S IN A DIFFERENT  LOCATION. MIGUEL, WHAT CAN YOU TELL US? >> Reporter: WE'RE JUST A FEW  BLOCKS AWAY FROM YOUR LOCATION,  I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE SCENE  HERE, IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLY TENSE OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF MINUTES, WE WERE HIT WITH PEPPER SPRAY  NOT A LONG TIME AGO. MY CAMERAMAN IS ACTUALLY  DRIPPING WITH PEPPER SPRAY. WE'RE BACK AND FORTH WITH  POLICE, IT SEEMS TO BE PICKING  UP AGAIN HERE AT THIS HOUR. HERE'S WHAT'S GOING ON. ON ONE SIDE HERE, WE HAVE  HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF  PROTESTERS WHO HAVE AGGRESSIVELY BEEN TRYING TO PUSH UP K STREET  HERE AND ON THE OTHER SIDE HERE, WE HAVE ROWS AND ROWS OF POLICE  OFFICERS, JUST BEYOND THEM A  LIMOUSINE WAS SET ON FIRE A  SHORT TIME AGO, THE TENSION  SEEMS TO COME AND GO HERE IN  SPURTS, WE'RE SEEING A CALM IN  THAT CONFRONTATION BETWEEN  POLICE HERE, WE HAVE SEEN SOME  VIOLENCE JUST BEYOND THE POLICE  OFFICERS HERE, WE HAVE SEEN  SEVERAL BRICKS ON THE GROUND,  THOSE WERE LOBBED AT THEM A  SHORT TIME AGO, WE HAVE SEEN  BOTTLES FLYING THROUGH THE AIR,  THE POLICE, WE HAVE SEEN THEM  USE PEPPER SPRAY AND SOME RUBBER BULLETS TO BACK UP THE CROWD  HERE, SOME TENSE MOMENTS AS THIS CLASH BETWEEN PROTESTERS AND  POLICE CONTINUES, LESTER.  >> WE'LL KEEP A GOOD EYE THERE,  WE HAVE SEEN EARLIER TEAR GAS  BEING LOBBED AND FLASH BANG  AGAIN GRENADES. I DON'T KNOW IF THE PRESIDENT  HAS MADE HIS WAY INTO THE WHITE  HOUSE, BUT THIS IS THE PARADE  ROUTE. THIS IS AGAIN CONSIDERABLY  SHORTER IN LENGTH, WE'RE TOLD  THAN PREVIOUS YEARS. ALL THOUGH TIME WISE, THEY SEEM  TO BE RUNNING FAIRLY LATE. WE'RE APPROACHING THE 5:00 HOUR  HERE IN THE EAST RIGHT NOW. >> TO BE HONEST, I'M HOPING THE  PARADE -- WE GET THIS PARADE  STARTED BECAUSE THE SUN IS GOING DOWN. THIS IS A BIG MOMENT FOR A LOT  OF PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY WHO ARE COMING TO THIS PARADE. WE HAVE DECENT LIGHTS ON  PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE THESE DAYS,  BUT I DON'T THINK WE CAN LIGHT  UP LIKE A STADIUM.  >> WHILE THE WEATHER, WHILE IT  HAS BEEN COOL, IT'S.  >> SUN SET IS IN ABOUT 18  MINUTES HERE IN WASHINGTON. >> OH, LOOK AT THIS. >> INDIANAPOLIS. IT'S ALWAYS WORTH NOTING AT THIS AND PREVIOUS INAUGURATIONS, YOU  HAVE POLICE FROM ALL OVER THE  COUNTRY. I REMEMBER THE OBAMA  INAUGURATION, AND THERE WAS  CHICAGO PD DIRECTING TRAFFIC IN  THE STREETS.  >> AND THEY WANT TO COME. >> I THINK IT'S AN HONOR. >> EVERY AFFILIATE I TALKED TO  TODAY, THEY WERE LEADING IN WITH AND OUR OWN POLICE OFFICERS WILL BE HELPING. >> THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE COURT  OPERATION. >> THEY ALL SORT OF FLEW IN. >> THE SECRET SERVICE HAS THE  RESPONSIBILITY OF PROTECTING THE PRINCIPALS, BUT THESE FRONT  LINES AND JUST THE TRAFFIC  CONTROL IS SOME UNDERTAKING.  >> A LOT OF THEM ARE PROBABLY  WORKING TOMORROW TOO, A BIG  EVENT. >> THE POLICE HERE ARE GOING TO  BE REALLY TAXED, I DON'T KNOW  WHAT THE ESTIMATES ARE, BUT THE  WOMEN'S MARCH IS HAPPENING  TOMORROW.  >> AND FALLING ON A FRIDAY,  ALLOWS FOR PROTEST PLANNING ON  THE WEEKEND AND THAT'S PROBABLY  GOING TO SWELL THE NUMBERS.  >> AND WE HAVE SEEN PROTESTS IN  OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AS  WELL, ALL RELATED TO THIS. PEOPLE WILL BE AS WE HAVE BEEN  DIE SECONDING THE INAUGURAL  SPEECH TODAY, TRYING TO GET A  READ AS TO PRESIDENT AND WHERE  HE PLANS TO TAKE THE COUNTRY,  HOW QUICKLY AND WHETHER OR NOT  HE WILL REACH OUT, YOU KNOW,  BEYOND HIS BASE OF SUPPORT. IT'S A PRETTY INTERESTING  FORMATION THERE. >> IT WAS INTERESTING, CASEY  HUNT, OUR CAPITOL HILL  CORRESPONDENT, SAID THAT DURING  THAT LUNCHEON WHEN THE CAMERAS  WERE OFF, THERE WAS A VERY  LENGTHY CONVERSATION BETWEEN  PRESIDENT TRUMP AND CHUCK  SCHUMER, A REPORT ON THE  CONFIRMATIONS AND TRYING TO DO  THIS, BUT FOR QUITE SOME TIME,  THEY SPENT TIME TALKING TO EACH  OTHER. AND YOU HEARD, WHEN WE GOT TO  SEE THE TOAST, YOU WOULD SEE  THESE NOW, AFTER CASEY'S  REPORTING, THE VEILED  REFERENCES, OH, CHUCK LIKES  THIS, REFERRING TO CHUCK  SCHUMER. AND APPARENTLY THERE ARE TWO  THAT HE HAS PROBLEMS WITH, TOM  PRICE FOR H.H.S., AND MICK  MULVANY, AND BOTH OF THEM HAVE  SOME ETHICS PROBLEMS. >> ABOUT 10 HOURS AGO, WE MADE  SENATOR SCHUMER BLUSH WHEN WE  SAID THAT DONALD TRUMP LIKES YOU A LOT. I DON'T UNCOOL BECAUSE  60 OF THEM ARE BOYCOTTING  TODAY'S INAUGURATION. THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP THERE. YOU NEED THE PRE-EXISTING  RELATIONSHIPS WHEREVER THEY LIE. >> ESPECIALLY TO THE EXTENT THAT HE IS A NEGOTIATOR. HE WANTS TO MAKE A DEAL AND MAY  NOT BE BOUND TO WHATEVER THE  REPUBLICAN ORTHODOX IS. >> BUT THE STRUGGLE FOR CHUCK  SCHUMER IS HE HAS THE BASE OF  THE PARTY WANTING TO GO IN ONE  DIRECTION. RED STATE SENATORS UP FOR  REELECTION IN '18, IN NORTH  DAKOTA, IN WEST VIRGINIA, IN  MICHIGAN, IN PENNSYLVANIA. HE'S GOT TO BE MINDFUL OF THAT  TOO. NOT AN EASY TASK TO BE THE  SENATE DEMOCRATIC LEADER. >> HIS APPETITE FOR DEALS MAY  COME -- HE MAY BE THE ONLY ONE  WHOSE APPETITE COMES CLOSE TO  DONALD TRUMP'S APPETITE TO GET  DEALS DONE.  >> WE BELIEVE THE FIRST FAMILY  IS INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE RIGHT  NOW FRESHENING UP OR DOING WHAT  THEY HAVE TO DO AND MAYBE  GETTING THEIR FIRST LOOK. >> JUMPING ON THE BEDS. >> AT LEAST THE GRAND KIDS MIGHT BE.  >> THIS IS THEIR HOUSE. >> CHECKING THE WET PAINT AND  SEE IF IT'S REALLY WET. >> THEY LIVE NOW THERE. >> THEY USUALLY SLIDE DOWN THE  BANISTER. >> BECAUSE THEY CAN. SO THERE'S A LOT TO TAKE IN  THERE. TO THE EXTENT THEY HAVE VISITED  THE WHITE HOUSE, THEY HAVEN'T  REALLY HAD A CHANCE TO GET A  FULL TOUR, HAVE THEY? TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE  WORKINGS OF THE PLACE? >> YES. I MEAN, MRS. TRUMP WAS THERE AND SAW MRS. OBAMA AND I'M SURE WAS  SHOWN AROUND, BUT NOT IN THE WAY THAT YOU DO WHEN YOU TAKE  POSSESSION AND YOU CAN LOOK  EVERYWHERE. >> NOT THAT TRIP WHERE YOU COME  IN WITH THE SWATCHES.  >> THERE IS THE REVIEWING STAND. BEHIND GRASS. LITTLE WARMER THAN THE CROWD  OUTSIDE. THE FIRST FAMILY WILL JOIN THERE IN JUST A BIT AND REVIEW AS THE  PARADE COMES BY. AND THEN OF COURSE IT WON'T BE  FINISHED AFTER THE PARADE. THERE IS A NIGHT OF MORE  CELEBRATIONS, THE INAUGURAL  BALLS. >> ALTHOUGH ONLY TWO THIS TIME  AS COMPARED TO 14 IN 19 WHEN  BILL CLINTON CAME IN. >> THERE WERE 14? >> 14, APPARENTLY. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ >> THEY ALSO USED TO HAVE  ENORMOUS FLOATS SOMETIMES  RELATING TO DIFFERENT MOMENTS IN THE NEW PRESIDENT'S PAST LIFE  AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS  MUCH LESS OR MAYBE EVEN BY THE  WAYSIDE. >> I CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST  FLOAT. >> THERE WAS A HUGE MODEL OF THE PT 109 AND ON TOP OF THE FLOAT  WERE HIS CREW MEN AND THEY WERE  ALL WAVING AT HIM AND HE THOUGHT THAT WAS JUST GREAT. HE WAS STANDING IN THE REVIEWING STAND.  >> WHAT ENDED THAT TRADITION? >> I THINK JUST COST AND EFFORT  AND PARADES ARE NOT WHAT THEY  USED TO BE. >> TROOPS AWAITING THE ARRIVAL  OF THE FIRST FAMILY TO EXIT THE  WHITE HOUSE AND MAKE THEIR WAY  OVER TO THE REVIEWING STAND. IS THIS THE NORTH LAWN WE'RE  LOOKING AT HERE? >> YES. >> THIS IS THE VIEW THAT YOU  OFTEN SEE NETWORK  CORRESPONDENTS. >> THAT'S THE BACKDROP. >> AND THE SECOND FLOOR ROOMS  JUST UNDER THE PORTICO ARE THE  ROOMS THAT USUALLY THE  PRESIDENT'S CHILDREN LIVE IN. THAT'S WHERE THE OBAMA'S GIRLS  WERE. UPSTAIRS ON THE FAR RIGHT,  THAT'S THE UPSTAIRS KITCHEN. >> I'VE ACTUALLY HAD A VIEWER  ASK ME IF THERE'S FOIL OR  SOMETHING IN THE WINDOW. I BELIEVE THAT'S SIMPLY THE  GLARE. >> I WAS WONDERING THAT MYSELF. >> BUT I SEE WHEN WE HAD A  DIFFERENT ANGLE IT WASN'T THERE, SO I THINK IT'S THE GLARE OF THE WINDOWS. I BELIEVE SOME WINDOWS. >> YOU CAN SEE THERE IN THE WEST WING. I BELIEVE SOME OF THESE WINDOWS  HAVE BEEN FORTIFIED. >> FOR SOUND PENETRATION AS WELL AS BALLISTICS. >> WE SEE MOVEMENT IN THERE. >> THAT IS PROBABLY CHILDREN OR  AT LEAST BARON TRUMP GOING IN  AND SEEING HIS NEW ROOM. >> THAT'S THE SECOND FLOOR. I SEE WHERE YOU'RE LOOKING AT  NOW.  >> AND ON THE THIRD FLOOR ARE A  HUGE NUMBER OF GUEST ROOMS AND  ON A WEEKEND LIKE THIS THE NEW  PRESIDENT'S RELATIVES ARE  PROBABLY STAYING OVER FOR THE  WEEKEND AND PROBABLY THOSE ROOMS ARE FULL. >> I FIND IT FASCINATING,  MICHAEL THAT APPARENTLY THEY CAN CONFIGURE THAT THIRD FLOOR AND  MAKE THEM BIGGER OR SMALLER. ON THE BUSH FAMILY THEY HAD TO  MAKE DOZEN THE AMOUNT OF ROOMS. THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO REMODEL THE WHITE HOUSE. >> EVERY FAMILY CAN DO THE  SECOND FLOOR AND THE THIRD FLOOR IF THEY TRY TO, FOR INSTANCE,  REPAINT THE BLUE ROOM. THAT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE  DIFFICULT. >> FIRST FLOOR THEY CAN'T REALLY TOUCH BUT SECOND AND THIRD.  >> WELL, THEY SHOULDN'T. THERE HAVE BEEN SOME TIFFS IN  THE PAST BUT I THINK THAT WILL  NOT HAPPEN. >> IT WILL CERTAINLY BE A CHANGE FROM A FIFTH AVENUE PENTHOUSE.  >> INDEED. >> MUCH DIFFERENT LIFESTYLE. OF COURSE, HE HAS BEEN LIVING  MUCH LIKE A PRESIDENT SINCE HIS  ELECTION. WE'VE SEEN CERTAINLY THE  BARRICADES AND THE BLOCKED  STREET THERE IS IN MIDTOWN  MANHATTAN AND HIS MOVEMENT HAVE  BEEN VERY RESTRICTED AND SEEING  NEW YORK MOSTLY THROUGH  BULLETPROOF GLASS AND SUVs. >> I'M THINKING OF HARRY HOPKINS KIND OF FIGURE WHO MOVED IN. >> THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE BUT  AT THE BEGINNING OF ROOSEVELT 
D ADMINISTRATION HARRY HOPKINS  DIDN'T DO THAT EITHER.  >> BEFORE THE SUN GOES DOWN, HOW IS KRISTEN WELKER DOING IN THE  TRUCK BED? >> CHUCK, I HAVE MADE MY WAY  FROM THE FLATBED TRUCK TO THE  WHITE HOUSE. WE ARE WAITING FOR PRESIDENT  TRUMP, THE FIRST FAMILY TO  EMERGE AND TO WALK TO THE  REVIEWING STAND. THIS WAS A TRADITION THAT DATES  BACK TO 1873. THAT'S WHEN PRESIDENT GRANT  DECIDED TO REVIEW THE PARADE  FROM THE WHITE HOUSE AFTER HIS  INAUGURAL CEREMONY AND THEN IN  1881 PRESIDENT JAMES GARFIELD  REVIEWED THE PARADE FROM A  ESPECIALLY BUILT BOX. THAT IS WHY YOU HAVE THAT  ENCLOSED BOX. I'M GOING TO COME IN FRONT OF  THE CAMERA NOW. HOPEFULLY WE WON'T MISS HIM  WALKING. THIS IS ALSO A CHANCE FOR  REPORTERS TO GET A QUESTION TO  THE NEW PRESIDENT. HE'S PRETTY CLOSE TO ME SO WE'LL GIVE IT OUR BEST SHOT. FOUR YEARS AGO WE TRIED THAT  WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA. WE GOT A WAVE. SO WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN DO A  LITTLE BIT BETTER THIS TIME. IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING  INSIDE, THIS IS A TIME OF QUIET  AND REFLECTION. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THEY'VE  BEEN IN THE WHITE HOUSE AS A  FAMILY. OF COURSE, THEY'RE JOINED BY ALL OF THEIR NEW STAFFERS, SO PART  OF IT IS GETTING TO KNOW THOSE  FOLKS AS WELL. THEY WERE HERE THIS MORNING WITH THE OBAMAS, BUT IT MUST BE A  VERY DIFFERENT FEELING TO BE  HERE FOR FIRST TIME AND KNOWING  THAT THIS IS THEIR NEW HOME. >> KRISTEN, WHEN DID THE OBAMA  STAFFERS LEAVE? WHAT WAS THE CHANGE OVER LIKE? >> WELL, WE KNOW THAT THE CHANGE OVER OVERALL TAKES ABOUT FIVE  HOURS AND WHAT HAPPENS TYPICALLY IS THE STAFFERS HEARSAY GOODBYE  TO THE OUTGOING FIRST FAMILY AND SPEND THOSE FIVE HOURS GETTING  READY FOR THE INCOMING NEW FIRST FAMILY. AND TYPICALLY MANY OF THE  STAFFERS WHO WORK HERE AT THE  WHITE HOUSE STAY. THEY STAY ON HERE AND CONTINUE  TO WORK WITH THIS NEW FIRST  FAMILY. HOWEVER, IN TERMS OF THE  STAFFERS AT THE WEST WING,  LESTER, THEY HAD PACKED UP  YESTERDAY AND MOVED ALL OF THEIR STUFF OUT OF THEIR OFFICES AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT WAS A  LITTLE BIT SOMBER HERE FOR A LOT OF THE FOLKS WHO HAD BEEN HERE,  PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO HAD BEEN  WITH THE OBAMAS SINCE THE VERY  BEGINNING, A LOT OF THEM ON THE  CAMPAIGN TRAIL BACK IN 2008. SO THE CHANGE OVER IS HISTORIC. IT'S MOMENTOUS FOR SO MANY  REASONS AND FOR SO MANY  DIFFERENT PEOPLE HERE IN THE  NATION'S CAPITAL. AGAIN, FOR THE TRUMP FAMILY  RIGHT NOW PROBABLY A QUIET  MOMENT OF REFLECTION AND TAKING  IN THIS HISTORIC DAY. >> IT IS PRETTY AMAZING WHEN YOU THINK OF HOW MANY PEOPLE HAD TO  BE REPLACED IN A FAIRLY SHORT  TIME SINCE EARLY NOVEMBER UNTIL  NOW. >> ONE OF THE FUN ANEK DOETS IS  THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS SURPRISED  AT HOW FEW STAFF STAY. I THINK HE THOUGHT THE WHITE  HOUSE STAFF WAS -- THAT THE  PERMANENT STAFF WAS MUCH LARGER  THAN WHAT HE FOUND OUT AND THAT  WAS AN EYE OPENING MOMENT FOR  HIM OF NOT REALIZING. ACTUALLY, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT  IT, HE'S NOT SOMEBODY THAT HAD A LOT OF EXPERIENCE IN GOVERNMENT. IF YOU'RE A CEO AND YOU TAKE  OVER A COMPANY, PEOPLE DO STAY. IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE THAT HE HAD  THAT MINDSET GOING IN, BUT I'M  TOLD THAT IT WAS --  >> WE TALK ABOUT HIM BEING AN  OUTSIDER, BUT MIKE, IT'S MORE  THAN THAT. HE IS THE FIRST PRESIDENT WITH  NO PUBLIC SERVICE EXPERIENCE. >> OR MILITARY. >> AND THERE ARE CERTAIN  BENEFITS ABOUT THAT THAT HE HAS  TALKED ABOUT. CERTAIN THINGS YOU DON'T KNOW  AND YOU HAVE TO COME UP TO SPEED EXTREMELY FAST. I THINK THE OTHER THING IS HE'S  BEEN A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMAN,  BUT THIS HAS NOT BEEN A FORTUNE  100 CORPORATION. THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION IS NOT A  LARGE ORGANIZATION OF THAT KIND. SO, YOU KNOW, HE ALSO HAS NOT  REALLY MANAGED ANYTHING WITH A  HUGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE. >> ONE OF THE TRANSITIONS  THAT -- THE TRANSITION THAT  EVERYBODY IS CONCERNED ABOUT,  TALK ABOUT THESE MOMENTS RIGHT  NOW. THERE MUST BE NERVOUS MOMENTS  WHEN YOU'RE THE NEW NATIONAL  SECURITY TEAM REALIZING WE'RE IN CHARGE NOW AND SOMEBODY MAY TEST US RIGHT NOW IF WE'RE NOT  CAREFUL. >> A COUPLE OF THINGS. I ACTUALLY WAS IN TOUCH WITH A  VERY SENIOR WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL RIGHT AS THE SWEARING IN WAS  HAPPENING. BECAUSE RIGHT UP TO THAT MOMENT  SOME PEOPLE HAVE TO BE THINKING  ABOUT NATIONAL SECURITY, AND  THEY WERE. THE SECOND THING, WE DON'T KNOW  THE NAMES EXACTLY OR THE FULL  DETAILS, BUT THE SENSE I GET  FROM THE OUTGOING TEAM IS THE  SENIOR STAFF SENT STAFFED UP. THEY'RE NOT READY AND THEY'RE  NOT COMING IN WITH A BIG GROUP  TOMORROW. WE CAME IN THE DAY AFTER  INAUGURATION AND VIRTUALLY EVERY SENIOR POSITION AT THE WHITE  HOUSE WAS FILLED AND THAT'S  IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY DON'T  HAVE TO BE CONFIRMED. WE WERE NOT CONFIRMED. IT TAKES A LONG TIME FOR THE  GOVERNMENT TO GET UP AND  RUNNING. HAVING SAID THAT, JUST THE TOP  PEOPLE CHANGE. I REMEMBER WHEN I WALKED INTO  THE WHITE HOUSE, EVERY SINGLE  PERSON THAT WAS ON MY STAFF,  JANUARY 21st, 2009 HAD WORKED  FOR PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH THE DAY BEFORE. AND THAT'S A GOOD THING. THOSE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE  THERE, FROM THE PENTAGON, FROM  THE STATE DEPARTMENT, FROM THE  CIA. THEY'LL BE THERE WORKING AND  SHOULD BE WORKING TOMORROW.  >> PETER ALEXANDER, CHECK IN  WITH YOU. TELL US WHAT YOU'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW. >> Reporter: WE'RE IN FRONT OF  THE REVIEWING STAND. PEOPLE HERE WHO WERE WAITING,  THEY GOT TO WAVE TO THE  PRESIDENT AND GOT TO SEE THE  VICE PRESIDENT AND HIS FAMILY. NOW THEY GET TO SIT OUT IN THE  COLD A LITTLE BIT LONGER AND THE PARADE CAN ULTIMATELY COME  THROUGH HERE. YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE  CROWDS HERE. WHERE WE ARE IN SOME OF THE MOST HIGHLY SOUGHT AFTER, MOST  COVETED SEATS, THERE ARE RISERS  THAT GO FROM MOST OF THE BLOCK  FROM 15th WHERE THEY MADE THE  TURN ALREADY -- ALL THE WAY TO  THE REVIEWING STAND. THEY'RE ALMOST EMPTY. THERE'S ALMOST NOBODY IN THEM  RIGHT NOW TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF HOW DIFFERENT THIS SEEN IS THAN  THE ONE DONALD TRUMP TWEETED  ABOUT SAYING THERE WOULD BE  RECORD NUMBERS IN ATTENDANCE. YOU'RE GETTING A LOOK AT IT  RIGHT THERE AND YOU CAN SEE HOW  STUNNING IT IS. NONETHELESS, IT IS A  CELEBRATION. SOME FROM VIRGINIA, OTHERS AS  FAR AS AS TEXAS. IT'S A CELEBRATION AND ONE  THEY'RE PRIVILEGED TO BE A PART. >> CROWDS DO MATTER TO DONALD  TRUMP. THIS IS GOING TO BOTHER HIM,  EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE PLENTY OF  RAPES WHY YOU COULD TURN TO FROM THE WEATHER, THEY'RE BEEN  RUNNING LATE. >> OH, I HAVE A GUESS. THEY'RE VERY THINLY STAFFED. THE AMBASSADOR JUST MENTIONED  HOW THINLY STAFFED THEY ARE. THEY'RE ALSO THINLY STAFFED ON  THE POLITICAL SIDE. YOU KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO  WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THOSE CHAIRS  HAD THEY BEEN INVITED. BUT IF YOU'RE THINLY STAFFED,  YOU CAN'T REACH DOWN TO THAT  LEVEL. THEY DO HAVE TO STAFF UP. IT IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT  ORGANIZATION THAN THE TRUMP  ORGANIZATION WHICH IS LEAN AND  MEAN. THIS IS DEEP. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY DESKS  THERE ARE AT THE NATIONAL  SECURITY COUNCIL, BUT EVERY ONE  OF THEM HAS --  >> HOW MANY OF THEM ARE CAREER  AT THIS POINT? ARE THEY CAREER UNTIL THEY GET  NUDGED OUT? >> DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN BY  THAT? >> YES. THE VAST MAJORITY OF NATIONAL  SECURITY COUNCIL STAFF ARE  CAREER. IT'S JUST THE TOP JOBS THAT ARE  POLITICAL. THOSE PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR  GUIDANCE. THERE'S DECISIONS THAT HAVE TO  BE MADE. THERE'S INCOMING. THERE'S INTELLIGENCE THAT COME  IN. AND THE REST OF THE WORLD  DOESN'T STOP JUST BECAUSE WE'RE  HAVING OUR INAUGURATION TODAY. THE REST OF THE WORLD DOESN'T  STOP ON SATURDAYS EITHER. MOST OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY  STAFF WHEN I WORKED THERE WORKED ON SATURDAYS. SO THE NOTION THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TIME TO SETTLE IN,  THAT'S NOT THE WAY THE SECURITY  WORLD WORKS. THEY'VE GOT TO BE READY  TOMORROW.  >> MICHAEL, WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT  A HANDFUL OF HOLD OVERS THAT  THEY'VE ASKED FOR FRANKLY IT IS  FOR NATIONAL SECURITY REASONS  AND THIS HAPPENS QUITE OFTEN.  >> IT DOES, BUT I THINK WE CAN  BEGIN TO ASK QUESTIONS. DONALD TRUMP IS NOW PRESIDENT. HE'S HAD SINCE EARLY NOVEMBER. HE KNEW HE WAS GOING TO BE  PRESIDENT. GEORGE W BUSH WAS ABLE TO GET  HIS ADMINISTRATION UP AND  RUNNING DURING A PERIOD OF  TRANSITION THAT WAS A LITTLE  MORE THAN A MONTH BECAUSE THE  SUPREME COURT DECIDE. WHAT IS THE REASON THIS HAS  HAPPENED? >> YOU HANDICAP YOURSELF A  LITTLE BIT. IF YOU WERE A REPUBLICAN AND AN  EVER TRUMPER OR IF YOU WERE A  REPUBLICAN WITH EXTENSIVE BUSH  ADMINISTRATION HIGH UP ON THE  LIST. >> IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LONG  TIME FOR THAT TO BURN OFF. THEY ARE TAKING THAT LIST VERY,  VERY SERIOUSLY. >> KRISTEN WELKER, YOU'RE THERE  WAITING TO SEE. WE ARE STARTING TO SEE SOME  MOVEMENT. >> CHUCK, THAT'S RIGHT,  PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS FAMILY,  THE FIRST LADY, MELANIA TRUMP  HAVE JUST EMERGED FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. THEY'RE ABOUT TO WALK DOWN THE  LENGTH OF THIS WALKWAY HERE AND  THEY WILL ENTER THE REVIEWING  STAND. THIS IS, AGAIN, ONE OF THE MORE  EMOTIONAL I THINK MOMENTS OF THE DAY IF YOU ARE THE FIRST FAMILY  AS YOU SORT OF TAKE IN THIS  HISTORIC MOMENT. YOU SEE THERE ERIC TRUMP AND HIS WIFE, BARON TRUMP IS THERE  FOLLOWED BY IVANKA TRUMP AND  JARED KUSHNER WHO'S OF COURSE  GOING TO BE ONE OF THE TOP  ADVISORS IN THE WHITE HOUSE. THAT ANNOUNCEMENT GOT SO MUCH  ATTENTION BECAUSE OF COURSE A  LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER  OR NOT THAT VIOLATED ANY ETHICS  RULES TO HAVE YOUR SON-IN-LAW  SERVING AS ONE OF YOUR TOP  ADVISORS. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION  INSISTING IT DOES NOT. AND HERE WE SEE FOLLOWED BY THE  PRESIDENT'S GRANDCHILDREN,  EXTENDED FAMILY. >> PRESSURE'S ON YOU, THAT  SHOUTED QUESTION. >> WE'RE VERY CLOSE. WE ARE HERE ON THE NORTH LAWN OF THE WHITE HOUSE. SO HE'LL BE ABLE TO HEAR ME. THAT'S FOR SURE. THE QUESTION IS WILL HE DECIDE  TO ANSWER THE QUESTION THAT WE  HAVE FOR HIM THIS EVENING AFTER  HE HAS BEEN SWORN IN, TAKEN THE  OATH OF OFFICE AND IS NOW THE  45th PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED  STATES. WE WILL CERTAINLY DO OUR BEST. I'M ONE OF SEVERAL REPORTERS  HERE SO I KNOW WE'RE ALL GOING  TO GIVE IT A BIG TRY. THIS IS A TRADITION THAT GOES  ALL THE WAY BACK TO PRESIDENT  GRANT. WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE PRESIDENT  YET, BUT WE ANTICIPATE THAT HE  WILL BE WALKING ALONG THIS  WALKWAY MOMENTARILY AS THE REST  OF HIS FAMILY HAS JUST COME OUT. AGAIN, WHAT THEY WERE DOING  INSIDE, ONLY THE FIRST FAMILY  REALLY KNOWS, BUT TYPICALLY IT'S A MOMENT OF QUIET REFLECTION THE FIRST TIME THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE WHITE HOUSE TOGETHER AS A  FAMILY. >> KRISTEN, GET READY, THE VICE  PRESIDENT IS ABOUT TO MAKE THE  WALK DOWN THERE. >> HERE THEY COME. >> GET READY FOR THAT. >> Reporter: HERE COMES VICE  PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE. MR. VICE PRESIDENT, HOW DID IT  FEEL TO BE IN THE WHITE HOUSE? >> VERY HUMBLING. >> Reporter: WHAT ARE YOUR  EMOTIONS AT THIS HOUR, MR. VICE  PRESIDENT? >> HARD TO EXPRESS. VERY GRATEFUL. >> WELL DONE, KRISTEN. >> Reporter: HAVE HUMBLING, HARD TO EXPRESS IN CASE YOU COULDN'T  HEAR IT. THAT WAS HIS RESPONSE. AND WE'RE GOING TO TRY WHEN  PRESIDENT TRUMP COMES ALONG WITH THE FIRST LADY MELANIA. WE'LL GIVE IT ANOTHER GO. AND AGAIN, HE'S VERY CLOSE. WE'RE HERE ALONG THE NORTH LAWN  OF THE WHITE HOUSE. AS LESTER POINTED OUT EARLIER,  THIS IS WHERE TYPICALLY THE  WHITE HOUSE PRESS CORP DOES OUR  LIVE SHOT. THIS IS A SPACE THAT'S VERY  FAMILIAR LIKELY TO ALL OF OUR  VIEWERS, WE HAVE SPENT A LOT OF  TIME OUT HERE. PRESIDENT TRUMP, THE FIRST LADY  LINGERING A LITTLE BIT BEFORE  THEY WALK OUT AND TAKE THIS  FINAL WALK TO THE REVIEWING  STAND WHERE THEY'LL WATCH THE  REST OF THE PARADE. >> WE GOT A LITTLE PREDICTABLE  BREAKING NEWS IS WHAT I'LL CALL  IT. WE NOW HAVE A NEW DEFENSE  SECRETARY. JIM MADDUX HAS JUST BEEN  OFFICIALLY CONFIRMED BY THE  UNITED STATES SENATE. I DON'T HAVE A FULL NUMBER BUT  WE KNEW GOING IN HAD A LOT OF  BIPARTISAN RHETORICAL SUPPORT. WE'LL SEE WHAT THE FINAL VOTE  COUNT IS. LOOKS LIKE SO FAR IT WAS 92-0 AT LAST COUNT. SO I WOULD CALL THAT A SHOW OF  BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. YOU KNOW JAM MADDUX VERY WELL. >> I DO KNOW HIM WELL. I THINK IT'S GREAT HE GOT THAT  VOTE. I THINK HE IS A FANTASTIC CHOICE FOR SECRETARY OF DEFENSE. I HOPE THAT HE WILL DEFINE THE  JOB BIGGER THAN JUST BEING A  I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE HIS  TALENT. I WANT HIM TO WEIGH IN ON  EVERYTHING. >> I HEAR YOU. >> ALL RIGHT, KRISTEN. HERE COMES THE 45th PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. >> WE'RE GOING TO GIVE IT  ANOTHER GO. HOPEFULLY HE WILL ANSWER OUR  QUESTIONS. THE VICE PRESIDENT DID. HOPEFULLY HE WILL TAKE A QUE  FROM HIS VICE PRESIDENT. HE IS OF COURSE HOLDING HANDS  WITH THE NEW FIRST LADY MELANIA  TRUMP. FORTUNATELY THE RAIN HAS HELD  OFF FOR THIS WALK FOR THEM. AND FOR THE LATTER PART OF THE  PARADE. SO THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO WALK  THE DISTANCE. >> Reporter: MR. PRESIDENT, HOW  DOES IT FEEL TO BE THE 45th  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES? WHAT ARE YOUR EMOTIONS AT THIS  HOUR, SIR? >> BEAUTIFUL DAY. >> TWO FOR TWO, KRISTEN WELKER. WELL DONE ON THE NORTH LAWN. >> Reporter: I'M THE NEW AL  ROKER. >> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT NECK  OF THE WOODS. >> Reporter: HE SAID BEAUTIFUL,  HARD TO DESCRIBE. YOU COULD TELL THAT BOTH OF THEM WERE INCREDIBLY HUMBLED I THINK  IS HOW I WOULD DESCRIBE THEM  WALKING OUT. THEY ANSWERED THE QUESTIONS, BUT THEY ANSWERED THEM ALMOST VERY  QUIETLY. I THINK, AGAIN, THIS MOMENT IS  SO ENORMOUS FOR WHOMEVER IS  EXPERIENCING THEIR FIRST DAY AS  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  AND OF COURSE DONALD TRUMP NOW  THE 45th PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS ABLE TO SPEND THIS SM TIME WITH HIS FAMILY AT THE  WHITE HOUSE AND NOW HE HEADS OUT TO THE REVIEWING STAND. AGAIN, THIS IS A TRADITION THAT  DATES ALL THE WAY BACK TO  PRESIDENT GRANT. SEEMED TO BE A QUITE HUMBLING  MOMENT FOR BOTH THE PRESIDENT  AND VICE PRESIDENT. >> ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU, KRISTEN. YOU KNOW, MICHAEL, IT WAS  INTERESTING WHEN WE WERE  WATCHING JARED KUSHNER AND  IVANKA TRUMP WALK IN, CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, NOT SINCE THE  KENNEDYS HAS FAMILY BEEN SO  IMPORTANT. >> I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. OF COURSE, BECAUSE FAMILY WAS SO IMPORTANT --  >> Announcer: OUR 45th PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES DONALD J.  TRUMP AND THE FIRST LADY OF THE  UNITED STATES MELANIA TRUMP. >> SORRY ABOUT THAT, MICHAEL. INTERRUPTING YOU THERE. I THOUGHT THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT  MOMENT FOR EVERYBODY TO ENJOY. HAIL TO THE CHIEF. I GUESS WHEN YOU'RE A NEW  PRESIDENT, YOU NEVER GET TIRED  OF HEARING THAT. >> I THINK THAT'S RIGHT. JACKIE KENNEDY WAS ONCE ASKED  WHAT JACK'S FAVORITE SONG WAS  AND SHE SAID HAIL TO THE CHIEF  AND I THINK A LOT OF THE  PRESIDENTS FEEL THAT WAY. >> I WANT TO FINISH THIS  THOUGHT, HELPING TO RUN THE  COUNTRY, HAVING FAMILY INVOLVED  IN IT REALLY NOT SINCE THE  KENNEDYS. >> RIGHT. AND IT WAS IN RESPONSE TO THAT  THAT CONGRESS PASSED WHAT IS  CALLED THE BOBBY KENNEDY LAW  WHICH IS THAT A FAMILY MEMBER  CANNOT SERVE IN THE CABINET AND  SO JARED KUSHNER CAN BE ON THE  WHITE HOUSE STAFF, BUT IF HIS  FATHER-IN-LAW HAD WANTED TO PUT  HIM IN THE CABINET, COULDN'T DO  IT. AND THE REASON WAS BECAUSE  J.F.K. BROUGHT HIS BROTHER INTO  GOVERNMENT AS ATTORNEY GENERAL.  >> HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW WAS AN  IMPORTANT ADVISOR. >> INDEED. STARTED BY SERGEANT SHRIVER.  >> DOW EXPECT MORE FAMILY? >> I DO. I EXPECT IVANKA AND JARED, THEY  HAVE MADE TOUGH PERSONNEL  DECISIONS AND HE TRUSTS THEM  INTIMATELY. WHAT A JOURNEY, THOUGH, THINK  ABOUT THE MAN SITTING DOWN FROM  THE TIME HE CAME DOWN TRUMP  TOWER UNTIL THIS MOMENT IT IS  THE MOST UNLIKELY JOURNEY I'VE  WATCHED IN 60 YEARS. >> THANKS FOR KEEPING THE  CONVERSATION GOING. I'M REJOINING YOU AS I WAS  INVOLVED WITH SOME OF OUR  PREPARATIONS FOR NIGHTLY NEWS. I UNDERSTAND WHILE I WAS  RECORDING SOMETHING FOR NIGHTLY. YOU KIND OF WONDER HOW THIS IS  SWEEPING OVER HIM. EACH MOMENT OF THIS DAY HOW REAL THIS BECOMES. OF COURSE, I GUESS ONCE YOU SIT  IN THAT OVAL OFFICE --  >> IT WAS FUNNY, MIKE PENCE, I  ASKED HIM THAT, IS IT STARTING  TO SINK IN. HE ADMITTED IT WAS ONLY IN THE  LAST FEW, SUDDENLY HIS FAMILY  WAS COMING IN AND YOU SUDDENLY  HAVE TO DEAL WITH MORE FAMILY. HE'D BEEN WORKING, WORKING  WORKING AND IT'S STARTING TO HIT YOU. THAT WAS TWO DAYS AGO. I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TODAY.  >> SO WHEN ALL OUR OLD FRIENDS  COME AND START CALLING YOU MR.  PRESIDENT, THAT BEGINS TO ALLOW  THAT TO SINK IN. >> HE'S GOING TO BE SURROUNDED  IN WASHINGTON BY A LOT OF PEOPLE IN HIS PARTY WHO WERE ABOUT  READY TO DROP HIM, ESPECIALLY  AFTER THAT INFAMOUS TAPE CAME  OUT.  >> IN SOME WAYS, HE SEES THAT AS A STRIKE. HE OWES NOBODY ANYTHING. HE HAS THIS FREER HAND THAN 
M NORMAL BECAUSE HE FEELS LIKE  NOBODY OFFICIAL IN THIS PARTY,  AT LEAST HE FEELS LIKE HE  DOESN'T OWE ANYBODY. THAT'S PRETTY POWERFUL. >> HE WILL NEED SPEAKER RYAN AND SENATOR MCCONNELL TO COOPERATE  WITH HIM. AND FROM CHUCK SCHUMER, THERE'S  GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO GET THINGS  DONE. I'M HOPING AN IMMIGRATION  OVERHAUL, BUT WE WILL SEE WHAT  COMES OF THAT COOPERATION, BUT  HE CAN'T DO IT BY HIMSELF. >> WILL HE DO SOME OF THOSE  NEGOTIATIONS UNILATERALLY? CUT OUT THE MIDDLEMAN? >> I THINK MUCH MORE THAN  PRESIDENT OBAMA WHO IS KNOWN FOR NOT HAVING GREAT RELATIONS, I  THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GOING  TO LIVE QUITE A LOT WITH MEMBERS IN HIS OFFICE. >> AND IT MAY BE JUST THE  OPPOSITE PROBLEM WHERE STAFF IS, LIKE, WAIT A MINUTE, YOU'VE --  WAIT. YOU PROMISED JOE WHAT, MR.  PRESIDENT? >> THEY'RE LEARNING IT. I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING  ABOUT A WEEK AGO HE WAS ASKED  THAT AND HE SAID I SEE WHAT HE  TWEETS WHEN YOU SEE WHAT HE  TWEETS. WHEN YOU'RE THE COMMUNICATIONS  DIRECTOR TO THE WHITE HOUSE,  PRESS SECRETARY, THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY TAUGHT YOU IN PRESS  SECRETARY SCHOOL. >> HOW MUCH IS IT POSSIBLE, HE  SAYS WHEN HE WROTE IN HIS BOOK  THE ART OF THE DEAL 30 YEARS AGO THAT ONE OF THE WAYS YOU MAKE A  DEAL IS TO BEGIN WITH AN EXTREME POSITION AND THEN LET OTHER  PEOPLE BEGIN TO TALK YOU OUT OF  IT. LET'S BEGIN WITH THE INAUGURAL  ADDRESS TODAY WHICH SOME PEOPLE  I THINK AMONG OUR GROUP THE  THOUGHT WAS PRETTY HARSH AND  PRETTY EXTREME S. THERE ONE WAY  OF LOOKING AT IT WHICH HE WAS  STICKING OUT HIS EXTREME  POSITION WITH THE UNDERSTANDING  THAT HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO BACK  UP? >> THAT'S WHAT I HEAR FROM HIS  SUPPORTERS. HIS SUPPORTERS WILL SAY WE'VE  GONE THROUGH THIS ISSUE. YOU TAKE HIM LITERALLY. WE TAKE HIM SERIOUSLY. THEY BOUGHT INTO THAT. THEY SAID THEY THINK HALF THE  STATEMENTS HE SAYS GIVE HIM THE  TACTIC. THAT'S WHY GUY HIM THE PASS. THE QUESTION IS HOW LONG DOES  THAT LAS.  >> AND TO WHAT END. AT A RUN FOR REELECTION, YOU  HAVE TO PASS SOMETHING. PRESIDENT OBAMA PASSED THE  AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. HE HAS TO PASS SOMETHING AND  THAT WILL REQUIRE ORGANIZATION  ON HIS PART. >> EACH OF THE SERVICES BANDS  ARE MAKING THEIR WAY PAST THE  REVIEWING STAND. >> Announcer: AND THE NEXT GROUP OF FINE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN OF  THE UNITED STATES ARMY RESERVE  THIRD TRANSPORTATION BRIGADE. MARCHING IN TODAY'S PARADE  REPRESENTS THE 205,000 SOLDIERS  WHO CURRENTLY SERVE. THEY HAVE SERVED IN CONTINGENCY  OPERATIONS IN AFGHANISTAN, IRAQ. >> THEY HAVE CARRIED A LOT OF  WATER IN THE WAR'S LAST DECADE  AND BEYOND. >> THEY SURE HAVE. >> TO KEEP REFERRING TO THEM AS  RESERVES I FEEL LIKE SOMETIMES  IS UNFAIR. THEY'VE BEEN NOT THE RESERVE. THEY'VE BEEN --  >> YEAH. AND THIS PRESIDENT HAS TALKED A  LOT ABOUT REBUILDING THE  MILITARY AND ABOUT -- HE HASN'T  QUITE ALWAYS ARTICULATED WHAT  THAT MEANS IN TERMS OF NUMBERS  OR WE KNOW HE'S BEEN ACTIVE NOW  IN THE NEGOTIATIONS REGARDING  THE NEXT FIGHTER AIRPLANE. >> THIS IS ACTUALLY SORT OF LIKE IT DEPENDS ON THE EYE OF THE  BEHOLDER OF WHAT THE MILITARY  YOU WANT IT TO LOOK LIKE. THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS OF  INCREASING THE MILITARY. SOME PEOPLE THINK WE NEED TO GO  TO MORE 20th CENTURY METRICS,  TROOP LEVELS, SUBMARINE LEVEL,  THINGS LIKE THAT. THEN YOU'VE GOT IN THE DEFENSE  DEPARTMENT THE LAST COUPLE  YEARS, CONCLUDING WITH RUMSFELD  AND GATES, WAYS THAT RESPOND TO  THE 21st CENTURY WARFARE. >> HE DID LAY DOWN A 350 SHIP  MARKER. IT IS THE ONE THING HE WOULD BE  HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR IN FOUR  YEARS. TO ENSURE THAT SHIP BUILDING  MATTER GETS MOVING AND I THINK  HE'S ALREADY ASSEMBLED A GROUP  OF OPERATIONS MOVING ON IT. >> NOT EVERY MILITARY PLANNER  THINKS THAT'S THE RIGHT CALL,  RIGHT? >> RIGHT. I MEAN, WHERE DID THAT NUMBER  350 COME FROM? WHAT IS THE MILITARY MISSION  THAT WERE ASSIGNED TO THAT. THOSE ARE THE DETAILS WE DON'T  KNOW. I THINK YOUR POINT IS AN  IMPORTANT ONE. SECRETARY CARTER WANTED TO  MODERNIZE, INNOVATE. HE'S OPENED OFFICES IN THE  SILICON VALLEY. PENTAGON NEVER HAD OFFICES IN  THE SILICON VALLEY UNTIL UNDER  MR. CARTER. THAT'S A DIFFERENT MODEL THAN  WHAT YOU WERE DESCRIBING.  >> BUT THE CHINESE EXPANSION AND THE ARTIFICIAL ISLANDS AND  WHETHER THE U.S. IS PREPARED TO  CHALLENGE THOSE IN A MEANINGFUL  WAY. >> THIS IS WHERE IT'S A  CHALLENGE OF BEING PRESIDENT. ON ONE HAND, YOU HAVE THE SHIFT  OF  INCREASING OUR MILITARY  PRESENCE IN ASIA. SOME WOULD ARGUE THE BEST WAY TO CONFRONT CHINA IS TO UNITE THE  REST OF ASIA IN A TRADE DEAL  WITH THE UNITED STATES. THIS IS THE BIG DEBATE. >> WHEN HE SAYS IN HIS SPEECH  WE'RE GOING TO DO PROTECTION,  SOME OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT  TRADING PARTNERS AROUND THE  WORLD ARE ALSO OUR ALLIES. AND SO THAT TENSION I THINK IS  FRONT AND CENTER, ESPECIALLY IN  ASIA BUT ALSO IN EUROPE.  >> MR. AMBASSADOR, WHEN HE SAID  ERADICATE ISLAMIC JIHAD IS  VASTER THAN ANYTHING LAID OUT IN THE CAMPAIGN. >> I THINK HE'S GOING TO HOPE WE DON'T REMEMBER THAT PHRASE IN  FOUR YEARS TIME BUT THAT'S JUST  NOT POSSIBLE, BUT MAKING THAT AN ASPIRATION MEANS WE'RE GOING TO  SPEND A LOT MORE. IF YOU WANT TO IRRAD INDICATE  ISIS, THAT MAY MEAN PUTTING  TROOPS ON THE GROUND IN PLACES  LIKE IRAQ AND SYRIA. SO THERE'S SOME REAL FOREIGN  POLICY TENSIONS THERE. >> I WROTE IT DOWN. ERADICATE FROM THE FACE OF THE  EARTH COMPLETELY. YOU DON'T LEAVE YOURSELF A LOT  OF WIGGLE ROOM THERE. >> WHAT I MEAN BY THAT, WE'VE  BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT. OUR NEW PRESIDENT IS SORT OF THE POLAR OPPOSITE OF OUR PREVIOUS  PRESIDENT. LIKE GEORGE W. BUSH ONLY USE  BLACK AND WHITE AND BARACK OBAMA WAS ALL GRAY. SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT TOO MUCH  GRAY AREA. NOW DONALD TRUMP TO A MORE  STARK. >> BUT TO MAKE A COMMITMENT THAT LESTER WRITES DOWN MEANS THAT IT WILL BE REMEMBERED. AND EVERYBODY ELSE GOT THAT AND  IN FOUR YEARS YOU'RE GOING TO  ASK THERE S THERE A BRUSSELS, IS THERE A NICE. >> IT'S A HARD THREAT TO  QUANTIFY, BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEN  ISIS INSPIRED INDIVIDUALS HERE  IN THE UNITED STATES. WE'VE SEEN THE ISIS ON THE  GROUND IN SYRIA AND IRAQ. WE'VE SEEN WHAT HAPPENED IN  EUROPE. SO IT IS MORE THAN ONE PLACE. >> YOU WONDER WHAT THE GENERAL  THOUGHT WHEN -- PRESIDENT BUSH  WHEN HE MIGHT SAY SOMETHING I  WOULD ALSO SAY BUT ISLAM, WE'RE  NOT AT WAR WITH ISLAM. PRESIDENT OBAMA WOULD HAVE SAID  THE SAME THING. YOU DON'T HEAR THAT FROM  PRESIDENT TRUMP. >> THERE WAS NO NUANCE TO IT AT  ALL. >> WHAT I ALSO HEARD IN THAT  SPEECH IS THIS IS WHY YOU  ELECTED ME. >> I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY I  WANT TO -- I'M NOT WORKING OFF  NOTES HERE. THE NEW YORK MILITARY ACADEMY,  IS THAT --  >> IT MIGHT BE HIS SCHOOL.  >> HE'S GOTTEN VERY FIRED UP BY  THIS. THAT'S GOT TO BE A NEAT FEELING. THINK ABOUT WHERE YOU WERE IN  CHILDHOOD AND THEY'RE THERE  HONING OUR PRESENCE. >> PRETTY HEADY STUFF. >> Announcer: NEXT UP FROM  LOUISIANA IT'S THE WEST MONROE  HIGH SCHOOL MARCHING BAND AND  RAIDERS. ♪♪ ♪♪ >> PRESIDENT CLEARLY ENJOYING  THE DIFFERENT MARCHING UNITS AS  THEY COME BY, GIVING HIS  TRADEMARK THUMBS UP AND SALUTING FROM TIME TO TIME. RON ALLEN IS ON THE NORTH LAWN  JUST BEYOND THE REVIEWING STAND. WHAT DO YOU SEE FROM THERE? >> Reporter: IT'S QUITE A MOMENT WHEN THE PRESIDENT AND VICE  PRESIDENT AND THEIR FAMILIES  WALKED BY. WHEN KRISTEN WELKER YELLED OUT  THE QUESTION, YOU COULD SEE HOW  THIS IS ALL AFFECTING THEM  . MR. TRUMP SAID IT'S JUST A  BEAUTIFUL DAY. MR. PENCE SAID IT'S A VERY  HUMBLING EXPERIENCE. YOU COULD FEEL THAT AS THEY'RE  WALKING BY. THEY WALKED SLOWLY AND TRYING TO TAKE IT ALL IN. THEY SPENT A RELATIVELY LONG  PERIOD OF TIME IN THE WHITE  HOUSE. THIS IS USUALLY JUST A STOP OVER ON THE WAY OUT TO THE REVIEWING  STAND BUT THEY STAYED THERE AND  THEY SEEMED TO LINGER THERE. WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THEY WENT. PROBABLY INTO THE RESIDENCE  WHICH IS THE AREA THEY CAME OUT  OF. THEY WALKED THROUGH THE WEST  WING. IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER MR. TRUMP  STOPPED BY THE OVAL OFFICE. I THINK AT THIS MOMENT YOU WERE  ABLE TO GET A SENSE OF HOW THIS  IS AFFECTING MR. TRUMP AND HOW  THIS DAY IS JUST PROBABLY VERY  HARD FOR HIM TO TAKE IN. ALSO I'M SURE AT THIS POINT HE  PROBABLY FEELS VERY CLEARLY AND  WITHOUT ANY DOUBT THE WEIGHT OF  THE OFFICE THAT HE HAS NOW  ASSUMED AND THE CHALLENGES THAT  FACE HIM AND THE CHALLENGES THAT FACE THIS COUNTRY. RIGHT NOW THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO ENJOY THEMSELVES. WE SEE SOME OF THE CABINET  MEMBERS COMING OUT AND GOING  BACK INTO THE WHITE HOUSE. NOW PROBABLY JUST A GOOD MOMENT  FOR THEM TO SIT THERE, TAKE IN  ALL THESE BANDS AND ALL THE  ENTERTAINMENT, AND JUST ENJOY  THEMSELVES. TAKE A DEEP BREATH AT THE END OF A VERY EMOTIONAL DAY NO DOUBT  BEFORE THEY GO OUT THIS EVENING  AND PARTY INTO THE NIGHT AT  SEVERAL BALLS. >> I KNOW THERE WAS A SKELETON  CREW THERE IN THE WHITE HOUSE  DURING THE ACTUAL INAUGURATION,  BUT DO YOU GET THE SENSE THE  PLACE IS COMING BACK TO LIFE NOW THAT PEOPLE ARE TAKING THEIR  POSITIONS? >> THAT'S A VERY OBSERVATION. YES, THIS PLACE IS MUCH MORE  LIVELY. WE'VE BEEN HERE ALL DAY. AT ONE POINT THERE WAS LITERALLY ONE PRESS OFFICER HERE FROM THE  NEW ADMINISTRATION AND THERE WAS ONE FROM THE OLD ADMINISTRATION. THEY WERE PRETTY MUCH ALONE IN  THE BUILDING. ALSO A LOT OF OFFICES WERE  CLEARED OUT. THE CLEANING CREWS WERE IN HERE. THEY HAD OVERTAKEN THE PLACE AS  THEY HAD ABOUT SIX HOURS OR SO. WE COULD SEE -- WE COULDN'T GO  BACK TO THE SOUTH PORTICO BUT WE SAW A TRUCK PARKED THERE FOR THE CHANGE OVER AREA. IT WAS VERY QUIET. THERE WAS SOME LEGAL STAFF HERE, BUT NOT MANY OTHER PEOPLE. AND WE WERE TOLD THAT VERY  SLOWLY AS THE DAY WENT ON AND AS THE WEEK UNFOLDS, THERE WILL BE  MORE PEOPLE COMING IN TO AS THEY SAY GO ON BOARD IS THE TERM THAT WAS USED HERE. NOW THIS PLACE IS FULL OF LIFE. FULL OF ENERGY. IT'S THE WHITE HOUSE AGAIN. IT'S NOT A PLACE THAT'S NOT  OCCUPIED BY EITHER FIRST FAMILY  AND, AGAIN, RIGHT HERE STANDING  HERE YOU FEEL THE POWER OF THIS  OFFICE. YOU FEEL THE MAJESTY OF THIS  MOMENT. WHEN WE CAN LOOK MR. TRUMP AND  MR. PENCE IN THE EYES, WE CAN  FEEL AND SENSE THAT IT'S A VERY  HUMBLING AND TIME FOR THEM TO  COME TO THE WHITE HOUSE FOR THE  FIRST TIME AS PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. >> WELL, HIS SPEECH TODAY, RON,  CERTAINLY MADE IT SOUND AS IF  HE'S GOT A FULL HEAD OF STEAM,  SO IT WILL BE A VERY, VERY BUSY  PLACE AS THE NEW ERA IN  WASHINGTON, THE TRUMP  ADMINISTRATION, TAKES OVER AND  SETS THEIR COURSE. THE PRESIDENT RIGHT NOW AND VICE PRESIDENT FOR THAT MATTER SEEM  TO BE HAVING A BALL. HE'S BEEN ON HIS FEET FOR QUITE  A WHILE. HE'S CLAPPING. HE'S SALUTING. HE'S GIVING A THUMBS UP. CLEARLY TAKING IN THIS MOMENT. I GUESS THE HARDEST PART OF HIS  DAY, MAKING THE SPEECH, IS OVER  NOW AND HE'S JUST TRYING TO TAKE IN ALL THESE MARCHING UNITS AS  THEY COME BY. AND KNOWING IT'S ALL FOR HIM. >> MICHAEL, YOU'LL BE GLAD TO  KNOW WE DID STUMBLE ON SONY AND  STEVE BANNON IN ""THE WASHINGTON  POST"" SAID IT WAS MEANT TO BE IN HIS RECEPTION. >> THERE WERE THOSE TONES. THEY COULD SAY YES, HE IS TRYING TO BREAK WITH THE ELITES BUT THE CAP NET IS FULL OF AN AWFUL LOT  OF BILLIONAIRES AND ELITES IN  THE PAST. >> THAT'S IN THE EYE OF THE  BEHOLDER, RIGHT? ON YOUR POLITICAL PERSPECTIVE  THESE DAYS. >> INDEED. >> THE ONLY ONE TO VOTE AGAINST  GENERAL MATTIS IN THE SENATE.  >> THAT'S ON A PRINCIPLE. SHE FEELS IT'S IMPORTANT NOT TO  SUSPEND THE IDEA. >> BY THE WAY THE FIRST BILL  DONALD TRUMP ACTUALLY SIGNED  INTO LAW WAS THE WAIVER FOR  GENERAL MATTIS THAT WAS PASSED  BOTH BY THE HOUSE AND THE  SENATE. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SEVEN  YEARS THAT YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO  WAIT TO SEVEN IN THE DEFENSE  DEPARTMENT AND THEY HAVE WAIVED  THAT RULE FOR HIM.  >> SO THIS HAS BEEN A LONG AND  FASCINATING DAY. I KIND OF WANT TO GO AROUND THE  HORN HERE AND GET EVERYONE'S  THOUGHTS. LET ME START WITH YOU. YOU HEARD THE SPEECH, THE TONE. WHAT ARE YOUR FEELINGS ON THIS  DAY? >> I'M VERY HAPPY WITH THE DAY. I VEHICLE THE CHANGE IN  WASHINGTON. I BELIEVE THE EMPHASIS ON  POPULISM HAVE VERY GOOD. THE EMPHASIS ON DOWNSIZING THE  GOVERNMENT AND RETURNING THE  ROLE TO THE GOVERNMENT IS VERY  GOOD. I WOULD HAVE LIKED A LITTLE MORE LUNCH IN THE MORNING. I WOULD HAVE LIKED A LITTLE MORE RECOGNITION THAT EVERYONE ON  THAT STAGE SERVED AND EVERYONE  DESERVES RESPECT, BUT HE WAS  DELIVERING A MESSAGE HAS STEVEN  BANNON IS CONFIRMED THAT HE  WANTED NOT TO IN ANY WAY  DIMINISH AND HE DID. OVERALL I'M VERY HAPPY WITH THE  DAY AND I'M GLAD THE NEW TEAM IS IN TOWN.  >> CHUCK, WHAT ARE YOUR  THOUGHTS? >> IT WAS A DIFFERENT KIND OF  INAUGURAL SPEECH. I THINK HE SET A TONE THAT'S  GOING TO BE TO SOME SOMEWHAT  CONFRONTATIONAL. TO OTHERS THEY VIEW IT AS THIS  WAS A MOVEMENT AND HE'S THERE TO BE THE LEADER OF THE MOVEMENT. IT IS I THINK THE SPEECH WAS  DESIGNED TO SAY HEY, I'M NOT  GOING TO GO ALONG. ONE OF THE BIG CRITICISMS THAT  SOME HAD OF PRESIDENT OBAMA IS  HE RAN AS A MAJOR CHANGE AGENT  AND HE CAME HERE AND HE TRIED TO WORK WITHIN THE SYSTEM. DONALD TRUMP WAS SENDING A  MESSAGE AT LEAST TODAY THAT HE  IS HERE TO BREAK THE SYSTEM. WHATEVER THAT MEANS TO PEOPLE IN A NEGATIVE CONNOTATION, THAT  HE'S HERE TO BREAK IT. LET'S SEE IF HE CAN AND WHAT  THAT LOOKS LIKE IF HE DOES. >> AND HE DIDN'T MAKE A PROMISE  TO BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER. THERE'S MORE TO CHANGE.  >> NO. I THINK IT WAS A POLITICAL  TACTIC. >> EXPECTATION SUFFICIENT HIS -- >> HE VIEWS IT AS THIS IS THE  BEST WAY TO ACCOMPLISH A GOAL. >> I THINK HE'S LOST AN  OPPORTUNITY THE LAST COUPLE OF  MONTHS IN TRANSITION. HE COULD HAVE TALKED ABOUT  UNIFYING THE COUNTRY, COULD HAVE PUT DEMOCRATS IN THE CABINET,  MAYBE JUST ONE OR TWO AND GIVEN  SOME COMFORT TO PEOPLE WHO ARE  SKEPTICAL ABOUT HIM. HE HAS CHOSEN NOT TO DO IT. HE HAD THE CHANCE TO GO IN  DIRECTION TODAY AND DIDN'T DO IT ONCE MORE. THIS SOUNDED TO ME MORE LIKE A  CONVENTION SPEECH OR CAMPAIGN  SPEECH, LESS LIKE THE UNIFYING  ADDRESSES EVEN BY PRESIDENTS WHO ARE VERY COMBATIVE LIKE FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT. >> BUT HE'S SAYING THIS IS WHY  YOU SENT ME HERE, THIS IS WHAT  I'M GOING TO DO. >> I THINK THAT'S HIS STRATEGY. I THINK IT MAY WIND UP LIMITING  HIM. I THINK THERE IF THE POLLS ARE  RIGHT WHY HIS APPROVAL WENT FROM THE HIGH 40s IN THE POPULAR VOTE THAT HE GOT ON ELECTION DAY TO  OUR POLL, 38 TO 40%. THAT'S NOT PROGRESS. USUALLY DURING THESE TRANSITIONS THEY GET TO BE MORE POPULAR. BARACK OBAMA AT THIS POINT WAS  72%. >> AMBASSADOR, THANKS FOR  JOINING US AS WELL. THAT'S GOING TO CONCLUDE OUR  COVERAGE OF THIS INAUGURATION  DAY. DONALD TRUMP NOW THE 45th  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. WE WILL HAVE A COMPLETE WRAP UP  OF TODAY'S EVENTS TONIGHT ON A  SPECIAL ONE-HOUR EDITION OF NBC  NIGHTLY NEWS. I'M LESTER HOLT. NBC NEWS IN WASHINGTON. GOOD DAY, EVERYONE.",8:05:19

in place holding pickaxes and shovels at the ready inside a well-lit tunnel under the Mexican countryside they can hear the vibrations of a vehicle above them and weary of making any noise that might give them away hold their work as the prison patrol passes overhead 30 feet below the prison's main yard there's little chance of being discovered but after several months of secret tunneling they can't take any chances especially when they are so close to their goal the prison cell of Mexico's most famous drug kingpin Joaquin el chapo guzman for months they've tunneled through solid rock with nothing more than pickaxes and shovels moving as fast as they can with their limited equipment but with great caution the work would go much faster if they could use modern tunnel digging equipment like jackhammers and boring machines but not only would that create noise that might give them away it would draw a great deal of attention to their staging area just a mile from the prison perimeter prior to tunnel digging El Chapo's powerful drug cartel purchased a small plot of land as close to the prison as they could get and began constructing two small homes as a cover for their real intentions the homes never made it past a rough brick outer shell though because of course they would not be inhabited instead they provided the cover needed to start construction on the tunnel that would set El Chapo free but the tunnel crew was facing incredible pressure to finish as quickly as possible due to his history of escaping from prison and evading police raids Mexican authorities could at any time transfer El Chapo to another prison in order to foil any possible escape attempts every day the tumblers took to get there boss was another day the entire thing could be for nothing and a new escape attempt in a completely different location would have to be devised but that's not all the unfinished buildings were beginning to draw attention from local officials and curious villagers alike why would someone start construction on an empty piece of land and then suddenly stop with only a shell of a home built time was running out and pressure was mounting inside his cell El Chapo was the model prisoner despite his long history of ordering some of the most horrific violence Mexico has ever seen El Chapo maintained a cordial and even pleasant attitude with his prison guards and fellow inmates his conversations over the phone carefully monitored his mail checked by prison officials but not a single hint of the ongoing plot was ever revealed El Chapo was a true professional by now and patient but his patience was running out the tunnel diggers faced a daunting task from the start and they knew they had to move fast despite the incredible pressure on them however they managed to not only reach out chapo before any potential prison transfer but they wound up breaking through to El Chapo cell just 16 months into his prison stay the tunnel they constructed was sophisticated impressing officials who would later remark that a tunnel of that magnitude should have taken 18 months to two years to construct its walls were reinforced when needed with wooden paneling and a generator pumped fresh air through a mile-long ventilation system to keep the tunnel oxygenated on the ground the tunnelers had laid down rails and used a motorcycle to shuttle two carts which were filled with dirt back and forth along the shaft once el chapo was reached he would ride on that same motorcycle and quickly shuttle the mile distance to freedom all that dirt though had to go somewhere and so the tunnelers cleverly transferred it to the tunnel opening where others would spread the dirt around on the field outside rather than dump it in giant piles which would no doubt draw attention still the presence of fresh dirt littering acres of empty fields was sure to eventually draw attention and questions that would not be easy to answer for the fake construction crew above-ground suddenly though in the middle of the night on July 12 2015 the sound of metal scraping came from El Chapo shower inside his cell moments later the ceramic bottom of the shower popped free and a friendly face greeted the imprisoned drug lord beckoning him into the darkness below wasting no time El Chapo ducked into the secret tunnel climbing down 30 feet into a tunnel only as wide across as a man but just tall enough for El Chapo to stand upright often derided for his short stature by his enemies the tunnel diggers had made sure that the tunnel was just tall enough so the boss wouldn't have to hunch as he walked along it a classy prison escape if we ever heard of one a few feet into the mouth of the tunnel El Chapo boarded a small motorcycle which had been affixed to metal tracks the carts full of dirt that had pushed along for months now were and just moments after leaving his cell el chapo was cruising along the well-lit tunnel like a kid on an amusement-park ride two minutes later el chapo ended his joyride by climbing up wooden steps and popping up into the empty shell of a home his crew had been secretly working from for a year and a half changing into clean clothes el chapo then climbed into a truck and whisked away into the dark of the night leaving behind an incredible mile-long secret tunnel and completely frustrated prison system and Mexican government both El Chapo would be caught again just months after his escape after his newest safehouse was given away weeks before his arrival by careless gunmen who were spotted by locals responding to reports of heavily armed men Mexican officials put the house under surveillance and intercepted communications saying that grandma or aunt was coming to visit realizing this had to be a high-value target officials waited for their chance to strike one month later Mexican Special Forces soldiers raided the home and killed several bodyguards but El Chapo and one of his most senior lieutenants escaped via you guessed it a secret tunnel popping up a mile from the home the two stole a vehicle at gunpoint though the driver immediately reported it to the police after issuing an alert for the stolen vehicle the Federal Police officers discovered the stolen car and placed the two fugitives under arrest El Chapo however wouldn't go without at least trying to buy his freedom knowing how easily corruptible public officials had been in the past El Chapo bribed the police officers offering them money homes and even lucrative jobs if they let him go little did the desperate kingpin know however that he was dealing with a brand new brand of Mexican police officer one not as easily corrupted as his predecessors all four officers refused El Chapo after which his offers of honey turned into vinegar telling the police officers that they were all going to die the four officers sent pictures to El Chapo to their superiors only to be warned that the police had received a tip-off that 40 heavily armed assassins were on route to free El Chapo with friendly forces still tied up at the compound the officers were ordered to a nearby motel on the outskirts of town where they hold themselves up in an empty room and prepared for a possible shootout for their lives all the while el chopped laughed echoing his previous threats suddenly a convoy of vehicles lit up the roadside clearly headed for the lonely motel the officers armed with m16s salt rifles and pistols prepared for what was surely their last stand el chapo taunted them telling them they were about to face death and after them their families yet the officers held their ground ready to die for duty sake if need be as the vehicles began to turn into the parking lot however el Chapo's taunts died in his throat once the glare of the headlights faded the barricaded officers could see military trucks full of Mexican Marines rushing to take up defensive positions around the motel minutes later a thoroughly defeated and dejected looking El Chapo was dragged into an SUV and rushed off to an airfield El Chapo would not escape from Mexican prison again and two years later any hope of ever escaping again would be Astacio approved an extradition request to the United States safely in US custody El Chapo faces life in prison and though he may have been one of the deadliest men in Mexico's history the drug kingpin would ultimately be remembered as nothing more than a sobbing mess as he begged us justice officials for leniency which they would not grant at the time of writing there are 2738 inmates on death row in the United States this number could change quite frequently given that some prisoners of course might be executed but others might have their sentence commuted they might have their sentence overturned or someone else might join them on death row right now only 2 percent of people on death row are women 42% of people are classified as white 41% black 13% Latino 1.9 percent Asian 1% Native American and the rest is stated as unknown you can be on death row for a long long time and believe it or not the average time spent there from sentencing to the day in the execution chamber is 20 years let's now see what happens on that final day 8 p.m. the inmate is taken from death row to another cell this involves a drive from the prison to what one former official in a documentary called the death house that official said prior to leaving death row and getting in the van to come to the death house the inmate will be searched really well he said this wasn't only because a weapon might harm a guard but mainly because they don't want the prisoner committing suicide another guard interviewed said he once took a route to the death house where they couldn't be ambushed tensions are high during these events he also said the atmosphere in the van was solemn we all knew where we were going and why nobody said a whole lot once the prisoner goes into the death house he won't ever see the light of day again unless some kind of appeal works for him 9:00 p.m. after booking in he can sleep until he's awakened if indeed he can't sleep we managed to find the diary of one prisoner who described his move to his new cell they stripped me out with a female officer present he wrote now personally I'm not the shy type but having a female officer on Death Watch is just one more humiliation we're told that during this time the prisoner is on something called death watch he's watched all the time and Casey tries to take his own life the cell is close to the execution chamber and it is very private a space where the inmate can reflect on life as the hours countdown this might happen just one day before but we found cases where it was a couple of days prisoners will also be given special clothes in most cases much smarter than prison attire the man who kept the diary wrote he was happy to have at last a pair of trousers with a button and zip we don't know how well he slept but in his diary he comments about watching the guard sleep this is what he wrote good for them I'm sure this has to be stressful for them so a moment's relaxation is well-earned I also enjoyed the irony who exactly is watching whom one other thing he says is that the death house is much cleaner than his death row cell he remarks that there is not a bug in sight whereas in his last cell it was like going on Safari 4:30 a.m. the inmate is woken up bright and early in his cell we should adhere times might change from place to place petitions might still be pending and there's a phone right outside the cell in the cell there's a shower a toilet a bed and a desk during this last day the prisoner is allowed to see family and can be visited by a chaplain as for calling people the inmate can write down a list of phone numbers he intends to call and give that to the guards one guard interviewed said we would dial the number for him and then allow him to make his call but after the prisoner has called the last person on his list the only person he'll have to talk to is the chaplain we're told that after this last call it can be a very traumatic time one chaplain interviewed said I was to do everything and anything to help him face that last day whatever it was writing letters making phone calls singing songs listening listening and listening 8 a.m. we said they can have visitors but 8 a.m. is the cutoff time after that the prisoner is on his own besides having prison staff around and of course anyone involved in this case should something change the chaplain can still visit - at around this time in the actual death chamber it's very likely that the equipment will be tested this might mean checking that the straps on the gurney work or even checking the phone to the governor's office is working yep imagine it wasn't and there was a last-minute reprieve if the form of execution is the chair then its electrical components have to be tested in one case we found the actual governor was the person who they strapped in to test if he could get out or move out of the straps I didn't want my staff to get kicked in the face he remarked 10:30 a.m. now it's lunchtime yeah this is an early lunch but let's not forget the inmate has been up a long time already lunch is not special it's not the last meal from what we can see it's the same old prison food the only difference is that the prisoner gets to eat it in a private setting the inmate we talked about before said what he got for lunch was orange juice and what he called a prison issue donut for quite a few hours now the prisoner has a lot of time to think and as you know they have a desk and can write any number of letters goodbyes or just reflect on life 3 p.m. if the inmate is to get the electric chair he'll have his head shaved around this time but this might also happen later in the day he might still talk to a spiritual adviser but food might also be on his mind right now around this time maybe an hour or so later the inmate will also be asked to dress in one of those smart clothes he's been given he'll be asked to take a shower before he does this a shower at least in total privacy he'll have already written down what he wants to eat so in the kitchen the death House chef will be doing all the preparations for p.m. the inmate will receive his last meal contrary to popular belief inmates can't just order what they want it makes sense because it's highly unlikely that authorities would splash out on the finest Wagyu beef in Florida for instance the maximum this last meal can cost is 40 bucks but this will change from state to state those poor convicts over in Oklahoma only get a limit of $15 or at least when one documentary we watched was made that is hardly enough to go crazy on your last meal it's still good though as one death house chef pointed out this meal is the only choice of food they might have had in two decades in some states though prisoners no longer get a bespoke last meal and only get the usual prison food to give you an idea of what inmates might choose we will list some last meals serial killer John Wayne Gacy had 12 fried shrimp an entire bucket of KFC some french fries and a whole load of strawberries the man behind the Oklahoma bombing Timothy McVeigh just opted for two pints of mint chocolate chip ice cream a killer from Florida called on Hell nieves Diaz shows absolutely nothing the terrible Ted Bundy did pretty much the opposite ordering a steak cooked medium-rare eggs on the side ovary some hashbrowns slices a toast and some milk and juice the infamous female serial killer Aileen Wuornos was good with just a cup of coffee while a murderer called Stephen woods must have been famished we should add that many thought he was innocent in his last words were you're not about to witness an execution you're about to witness a murder before that he has to eat according to the website rancor two pounds of bacon a large for meat pizza for fried chicken breasts two drinks each of Mountain Dew Pepsi root beer and sweet tea two pints of ice cream five chicken-fried steaks two hamburgers with bacon fries and a dozen garlic breadsticks with marinara on the side that state must have had a big budget 5:00 p.m. the witnesses will likely arrive at the prison this might be family of the victims journalists family of the condemned Friends of the condemned or whoever the condemned has asked to be witnesses they will be told to try and stay quiet when they reach the witness room before that they'll wait somewhere else in most states civilians who didn't know anyone involved will be asked to witness the execution 6:00 to 8:00 p.m. the time of execution can vary from state to state but it's just about always in the early evening at this point the prisoner will be taken to the execution room the witnesses will soon be in the witness room prisoners for the most part will just walk right there and not get the guards any problems in some states this will be a five man team just in case there is a struggle but that doesn't happen often one warden interviewed who had done 89 execution said he'd only had one prisoner that was hard to deal with the walk to the chamber in most places is only about ten feet just over three meters the guys would usually walk right up to the electric chair they weren't forced by the staff by that point they've already accepted what will happen a former death watch guard told Business Insider another guard in a separate interview said the same inmates usually act very dignified it's a very clean procedure there's no hustling and bustling it's not always this way especially for prisoners protesting his innocence in 2018 the BBC reported that one man in Florida was screaming and thrashing before he was executed screaming to everyone that they were murdering an innocent man one warden said the first thing that catches his eye is that gurney which is the place he's gonna die if it is lethal injection which it often is the prisoners told to sit on the gurney and then lay down there will be a tie-down team each responsible for a part of the prisoners body doctors will usually not be at the execution because it's not in line with their code of ethics so there will be a special team to administer the drugs this is not always easy as the veins tend to hide during this stressful time some of them had burnt veins from drugs which would make the process longer and more painful said one former warden when the catheters are in place the inmate will be secured again there's about 15 minutes before the execution believe it or not some inmates have got a stay which means they call to stop the execution during these last minutes if that doesn't happen the witnesses are brought into the main room and the curtains are undrawn some inmates might make a final statement it depends on the state but some prisoners might be given a few minutes and others just allowed to make a brief statement Kentucky gives two minutes but in Pennsylvania you can't talk at all in the statement can only be written here are some fairly recent examples of last words I'm ready to roll time to get this party started my last words will be Hoka hey it's a good day to die somebody needs to kill my trial attorney I think that governor's phone is broke he hasn't called yet these are of course unusual ones and most people will just say their goodbyes to loved ones or give an apology for what they did at this point the Chaplin might lay a hand on the prisoner sometimes where there's a pulse the warden will give the signal to the executioner and then it's time the end of the day the end of a life if you've already seen the 2008 movie Bronson about Britain's so-called most notorious prisoner don't worry that rather theatrical piece of cinema didn't tell you much about the man so there's so much more to see today you might be thinking that it's coincidental that a man with such a reputation has the same name as a former Hollywood tough guy but he wasn't called that at birth the name was acquired during his bare-knuckle boxing days he was actually born Michael Gordon Peterson yep that doesn't sound quite as fearful there's a lot of controversy about this man regarding whether he should have been in prison for so long or if prison is to blame for his often crazy behavior we discussed this and more in this episode of the infographic show Britain's most notorious prisoner Charles Bronson as you know he was born with the name Michael his birthday was December 6 1952 he spent his first few years in Wales and then moved to Luton which isn't too far away from the capital London it doesn't seem that he came from a rough-and-tumble background given that his father ran a Conservative Club for a while and his auth and uncle were a mayor and Mayor s his aunt actually once said this about him as a boy he was a lovely lad he was obviously bright and always good with children he was gentle and mild-mannered never a bully he would defend the weak he might have defended the weak but it seems his penchant for violence and crime started early in life after he moved up north at the age of 13 it seems that that's when trouble started at that age he was charged as a juvenile for stealing and it said he was part of a gang he didn't much enjoy school and soon left to start working at an early age his first job came when he moved back down to Luton this was a very short 2-week stint working in Tesco supermarket apparently he was fired for attacking his manager after this it seems crime became second nature to young Michael he got in trouble for criminal damage but got off with a fine in some probation he had lots of jobs mostly related to labour or factory work and we're told he enjoyed nothing more than a good night out on the town drinking gallons of beer and getting into fistfights with the locals easy to do in some areas of the UK he likely wasn't sure to foes on the mean streets of Luton one of his jobs we're told was a circus strongman so he was likely a hard man to fight he got in trouble again after crashing a stolen lorry or a truck into another car but again got off with just a fine as no one was seriously hurt at this point he is still in his teens yet again he got into trouble and at this time aged 19 when he was involved in a smash-and-grab which is basically smashing a car into a shop front and getting as much as you can again he got off with just a fine and a suspended sentence age 20 perhaps he got his chance to join what is sometimes called the straight and narrow as he met a girl and got married but apparently she quite liked his tough-guy persona his tailored suits and the fact that he spoke in a cockney accent they had a child and called him Michael Jonathan Peterson according to the British press the son is very private and has never spoken publicly about his notorious death so we can't tell you much about him moving on now 22 Michael was arrested for armed robbery and at this time the judge came down hard he got seven years but prison wasn't exactly a place he liked being a scene during his first stint in prison in Liverpool he attacked two other prisoners and we're told he wasn't provoked that got him time in solitary something he would see much more of later he was then transferred to prison in Hall and again had issues with guards and prisoners they gave him sedatives to calm him down which apparently made him very ill he also spent more time in isolation and he was said to be a very difficult prisoner on one occasion he was out of solitary he attacked a prisoner with a glass jug and he was convicted of unlawful wounding yet again he was moved this time to the tough armed Lee jail in Leeds a foreboding looking place if you've ever seen one so there he was now serving time and what looks like a medieval castle even in 2018 the place is said to be the place with the highest rate of people taking their own lives and in the press right now it said it's still very much an unsafe place for both prisoners and staff back in the 70s it can't have been a holiday but it seems he was too much for armed lee and he kept moving between a number of prisons sometimes chained to the floor of the vans he travelled in it said if not in solitary he would attack prisoners and guards it's also said he occurred numerous vicious beatings from the guards after an attack you might have seen that in the movie which depicts these guards having to tackle him in numbers during one time in solitary while recovering from a beating he got divorced we imagined this might have been a low point but it said that one thing that kept him going was his solitary workout routine keeping him healthy and fearsome his book solitary Fitness which he wrote after many years inside has sold millions of copies reviews are actually very positive although people talk about how strange the book can get at times profits from the book says the media go to children's charities the British press tells us that his strength was quite unbelievable he once bent the cell bars with his own hands and it said he holds six World Records for strength and fitness another unofficial record he is set is the most prison rooftop protests by any British inmates but right now we're still in the 70s and a long way from fame or infamy while in prison in London he tried to poison an inmate and it seems that was the straw that broke the camel's back enough with prison he was transferred to a psychiatric facility but guess who he met there two of Britain's most ruthless gangsters the Kray twins he called them the best two guys I ever met that friendship didn't last long though as he was moved back to prison what followed was more solitary escape attempts attacks on prisoners that ended with lifelong scars more attacks and finally when the authorities were sick and tired he was sectioned under the Mental Health Act he was no longer just a criminal but mentally ill in 1978 he was again in another special facility but it seems he didn't much like being forced to take medication and wasn't keen on the fact that he was surrounded by some of Britain's most disturbed people men who would never leave the facility because they had done things to people we will not talk about yep he didn't like some of these terrible men and at one point was said to be about five seconds away from killing a fellow patient or prisoner who had taken the life of an innocent child in his own words describing the people around him at the facility I witnessed them running into walls using their heads as Rams I've seen them fall unconscious doing this there was one who just kept trying to eat himself biting his arms legs and feet he tried to kill another prisoner and then in 1982 when still in the notorious Broadmoor he led a rooftop protest that lasted three days had cost around $300,000 worth of damage now you can see why this guy became well-known as a hard to deal with prisoner but there was a lot more to come he hadn't even started he led to more rooftop protests and also went on a hunger strike but in some ways he found solace in writing poems sketching and creating cartoon strips he even won awards for his work it didn't stop him being violent though just settled him down from time to time psychiatrists couldn't figure him out and even though he was in a mental facility he was never properly diagnosed he once said asylums are crazy places with crazy rules you're not mad when you arrive you are when you leave again he was moved from facility to prison stabbing inmates hitting others more rooftop protests more isolation more beatings from the guards more medicine and perhaps his piece de resistance he once strangled a prison governor after that he was not allowed out of isolation until he finished his sentence he got out of prison in 1987 and almost immediately turned to crime although his first offense was quite comical he bought a water pistol and modified it a bit afterwards he forced a man at water pistol point to drive him to Luton his favorite spot there he started bare-knuckle fighting and earned the nickname Charles Bronson he actually legally changed his name to this was this the start of a life on the outside not a chance it's written that he would fight anyone and even challenged the king of bare-knuckle fighting Lenny McLean it seems Lenny wanted no part of him or at least when he agreed to fight it was too late as Bronson was back in prison in another fight he was challenged to go against a large Rottweiler he killed it and said later in life that he really regretted that it was cash in hand though he was only out of prison months and was back inside again for armed robbery we won't go into details but he fought again attacked prisoners guards and had more time in solitary was moved and moved and moved and occasionally tried to start riots in 1989 he was attacked himself stabbed in the back several times but he recovered he wouldn't tell the police anything about his attackers in 1992 he got out for the grand total of 53 days he was jailed but got off then he was arrested again for having a shotgun and conspiracy to rob it gets crazy here because while on the remand he took a librarian as a hostage while negotiating with police he had three demands an inflatable doll a helicopter and a cup of tea yep you heard that right he was given eight years despite saying the gun was to blow off his own head it wasn't the first time he had contemplated taking his own life he was difficult again transferred from prisons and at times was left naked for many days on end in dark isolation at one point he was put in the worst spot in any prison in the UK something called the Hannibal cage that had been created for another prisoner who had once killed inmates and was said to have spooned out one person's brain and eaten it even though at one point he attacked a governor it said he got much better after being allowed to interact with handicapped children he also kept up his cartoon sketching these were the quiet times they didn't last long he endured more solitary more moves and then in one prison he took two Araki hijackers as hostage in his cell it said he was going crazy after losing his father it's also said that he told the guards if they came close he would snap off the heads of his hostages he made his hostages tickle his feet and demanded they sing songs to him to them he was known as the general he demanded a plain machine guns ammunition and a cheese and pickle sandwich it seems later he just kept asking for ice cream in the end he let the hostages go and another seven years were added to his sentence while in great physical shape it's said that all the time in darkness and solitary had negative effects on his eyes and his social skills and lawyers now started to get on his side it's a pity then that he took one of them hostage he let him go quickly though but after one civilian worker criticized his drawings he took him hostage too and then started ripping up parts of the prison hmm what else well after the Millennium he got married again converted to Islam changed his name and took another hostage wrote a book sketched a lot and then changed his name to Charles Arthur Charlie Salvador out of respect for his favorite artist the movie came out and he became a household name until then not many people knew about him thousands of people around the world started to support him saying even though he had been a bad boy his incarceration had just gone on too long but he couldn't stop messing up in 2014 he attacked another governor that same year his artwork went up for auction and his 200 pieces often dark in nature fetched around 30,000 pounds Bronson donated a large part of this to the brain tumor charity and Keach Hospice in Lutton Bronson said the old him was now dead and he was born again as the artist Salvador he created more works to donating to other charities and one time Oxford's homeless he also got married to an actress in 2017 and she's hoping to see him out soon in total out of the 44 plus years 36 of them have been in solitary confinement sometimes without light in 2018 it was said that he is an open prison but will have his case reviewed in two years and could get out that might not happen though as he's got a life sentence for one of his kidnappings that was a teacher in 1999 that he held for two days the British media reports that he allegedly smothered himself in butter 865 and challenged the guards to a fight we'll leave you with something he once said I'm a nice guy but sometimes I lose all my senses and become nasty that doesn't make me evil just confused trees growers of fruits spices and nuts generators of shade home to birds squirrels koalas frontline soldiers in the fight against climate change you bet today we're doing something a little different and talking about team trees orcs mission of planting 20 million new trees by 2020 where every donation of $1 equals one tree you might be asking yourself what would planting 20 million new trees do for the planet let's take a look at just how huge an impact each donation on team trees will make a wide variety of organisms from lichen to bees to opossums call trees home and just one single mature oak tree can be home to as many as five hundred different species the earth is rapidly losing species we're in the middle of a mass extinction and without trees for them to call home many more animals will be at risk for extinction many animals require trees as a place to live to feed and to provide protection so planting just one tree is like building a house feeder and nursery all at once donating $20 to plants 20 trees is like building an entire animal city multiply that by a million and we're talking about a super metropolis of biodiverse animal life study after study shows that spending time and a grove of trees or forests can provide emotional rejuvenation it can improve your mood create a sense of peace while reducing stress depression and anger the Japanese even have a word for this Xin Rena yoku for forest bathing the effect of trees is not only emotional but physical studies have shown that being among trees reduces blood pressure as well as lessen stress-related hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline so basically trees make you happy plenty of scientific research has shown that happier people commit less crimes especially violent ones we think a grove of even just a few trees would be pretty nice 20 million new trees would mean potentially thousands of new growth which means millions of people able to take regular forest baths increasing happiness and reducing crime you'd be a regular crime fighter all thanks to the trees you helped plant trees reduce air temperature through blocking sunlight and creating shade trees also helped it cool by reflecting heat upwards from their leaves further cooling occurs when moisture evaporates from the surface of the leaves just like the way your body cools down by sweating trees can cool down an area by a lot and we're not talking just a couple of degrees urban neighborhoods with mature trees can be up to 11 degrees cooler in summer heat than neighborhoods without trees just think about the difference between a miserably hot 90 degree day and a warm comfortable 79 degrees trees can also cool down buildings limiting the need for air conditioning which has the added benefit of helping to conserve energy studies have shown that shade from strategically planted trees can reduce the air conditioning costs of buildings by 20% to 30% just think if an average home has a cooling power bill of around $100 per month in the summer and if 10 trees were planted around that same house then 30% could be saved and that means 20 million trees planted around homes could save sixty million dollars in energy costs so if you can't donate to this particular cost please consider planting a few trees around your house not only will they be a beautiful addition but they might even save your future self some money on your power bill trees are ideal for use as sound barriers because they reduce sound in two ways first they absorb the sound since thick branches and leaves are great at absorbing high frequency noise secondly trees deflect sound when a sound hits a rigid material it bounces back when a sound hits flexible materials such as branches the material vibrates and the sound is transformed into other forms of energy a thick row of trees can block as much as 15 decibels of sound that's almost like wearing a pair of earplugs but you have something beautiful to look at instead of uncomfortable foam in your ears the root system of trees hold soil in place during heavy rainstorms preventing erosion flooding and mudslides keeping people and building safe trees improve water quality - as their root systems help to filter impurities and retain water within the soil this allows for water tables to be recharged with less water ultimately ending up in sewers and diminishing the amount of stormwater carrying pollutants to the ocean a single 100 foot tall tree can take as much as 11,000 gallons of water out of the soil during its growing season releasing the water as healthy oxygen and clean water vapor that means 20 million trees could filter a staggering 220 billion gallons that's enough to fill more than 300,000 Olympic swimming pools human inhale oxygen in exhale carbon dioxide trees do exactly the opposite by absorbing and storing carbon dioxide during photosynthesis which produces and releases oxygen as a by-product excess carbon dioxide is building up in our atmosphere strengthening the greenhouse effect and contributing to global warming the more trees the earth has the more carbon dioxide is absorbed and mitigated the amount of oxygen produced by a tree depends on several factors including the species of tree its health and the ambient temperature however some typical calculations are that a single mature tree can absorb carbon dioxide at a rate of 48 pounds per year and release enough oxygen back in the atmosphere to support two humans one acre of trees annually consumes the same amount of carbon dioxide equivalent to driving an average car for 26,000 miles if we assume that an acre has roughly 300 trees then 20 million new trees could consume the carbon dioxide equivalent of a new car driving over 1.7 billion miles annually last but not least in addition to carbon dioxide trees absorb other potentially harmful pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide the canopies of trees act as a physical filter trapping particulates of dust pollen smoke and smog a single mature tree removes up to 2.2 pounds every year which means 20 million could remove up to 44 million pounds and that's not all studies have also shown that the dust level in the air can be as much as 75 percent lower on the sheltered side of a tree as compared to the windward side no one and we mean no one likes dust in the air so do yourself and your neighbors a favor and plant some trees or donate a few dollars to team trees org and clean the air for yourself and generations to come in July of 2019 a Swiss study stated that if we plant enough trees we can stop or at least put a serious dent in climate change which is why we're committed to helping team trees orgs mission to plant 20 million new trees by 2020 the infographic show is getting involved and you should too every donation of $1 equals a new tree planted so become part of something huge with real benefits and show the world that the YouTube community can come together and do something incredible usually waking up because you have to go to the bathroom is annoying but on May 26 2013 waking up and leaving his bunk to use the bathroom was a decision that saved 29 year-old Harrison or Jigme or Kenny's life through an odd twist of fate Harrison ended up being the lone survivor of a boat sinking at sea he can lay claim to a unique title he's the only person in the world who have survived on the sea floor for nearly three days the Gulf of Guinea in the southeast Atlantic Ocean is rich with petroleum Laden layers of sedimentary seabed many offshore oil rig drilling operations dot the African coast here on May 26th about 20 miles off of a scrub us Nigeria in choppy seas three tugboats pitched in yacht as they performed tension tow functions on a chevron oil tanker filling up at single buoy mooring number three just before 5:00 a.m. the tugboat jasc on 4 was caught by a large rogue wave and capsized because of ongoing piracy problems in the Gulf security protocol on the tugboat was that the 12-man crew would lock themselves in their room when sleeping unfortunately this rule slowed down the jasc enforced crew when they tried to escape the crew members had to first scramble out of their cabins that is except for the vessels cook Harrison who had got enough to use the bathroom in his underwear when the tugboat keeled over and the ocean rushed in Harrison had to force the bathrooms metal door open against the wall of water the pressure of the water was extremely strong and Harrison was unable to follow some of his colleagues to the emergency hatch he watched in horror as a surge overwhelmed three crew members and swept him out of the boat into the raging sea then the water pushed Harrison down a narrow hallway into another bathroom which had joined in officer's cabin dazed and bruised but miraculously still alive Harrison held on to an overturned wash basin to keep his head above water in the four foot square bathroom the boat sank nearly 100 feet eventually coming to rest upside down on the sea bed when the tug boat capsized there was an immediate rescue operation launched with the other boats in the area and a helicopter a diving crew quickly located the wreck and marked the location with buoys they banged on the hull Harrison hammered back but they didn't hear him as the divers weren't prepared for deep diving they could only stay at the depth of the rack for a limited period of time the rescue was called off due to no evidence of survivors after nearly a day of being in the bathroom Harrison got up the courage to leave his little air pocket in pitch darkness he swam and felt his way into the engineers office miraculously there was another air pocket here two of about four feet high in Harrison's estimation having solved the immediate problem of having air to breathe Harrison could focus on other concerns the first one being that he was cold in May the surface temperature of the East Atlantic on average is a pleasant eighty one point nine degrees Fahrenheit but Harrison was 100 feet down shivering wet and wearing only boxer shorts Harrison faced hypothermia or his body losing heat faster than he could produce it cautiously Harrison felt his way around the cabin he found some tools and used them to strip off wall paneling with a mattress and the material from the wall he was able to make a platform to sit on this platform helped Harrison to stay afloat and lifted the upper half of his body out of the water allowing him to reduce heat loss hungry thirsty cold and stuck in complete darkness Harrison was terrifying he tried to think about his family quite religious whenever he felt especially scared Harrison would pray and call on Jesus to rescue him over time the sea water began to remove the skin from Harrison's tongue he could smell something rotting he thought it was the decomposing bodies of his former shipmates every small sound in the dark was magnified the creaking of the home the banging of the wreckage against the walls and most horrific alee splashing and eating noises as fishes nibbled at corpses meanwhile a dive support vessel the Lueck toucan arrived to the area of the sinking the parent company of the jasc on 4 West African ventures had hired a deep-sea salvage saturation diving team from subsea services company DC and global to retrieve the bodies of the lost crew members the six divers deck crew and technical staff of the Lueck toucan knew it was going to be a grueling mission aside from the heart-rending work of recovering the dead the boat had sunk upside down in the soft mud stirring up fine silt and creating extremely poor visibility furthermore because of the security protocols the boat was latched from the inside dive team to consisted of Niko van Heerden Andre Erasmus and Daryl you Stacy with supervisor Colby we're topside on the ship helping to guide the dive via a connected microphone while watching the dive through a camera worn by Nikko the team spent over an hour breaking through an external watertight door and then a second metal door to get into the sunken boat once inside it was extremely disorienting with the ceiling being on the bottom and the floor of her head the murky water was filled with all sorts of hazards including furniture and equipment slowly painstakingly the divers explored the boat they'd recovered four corpses when Nikko crawled up the stairs to the main deck it was a tight squeeze with the diving gear on his back he was in a small passageway getting his bearings when something suddenly reached out of the murk and touched him Harrison had nearly given up hope when he had heard a noise that sounded like an anchor dropping then eventually he heard hammering on the hull of the boat he knew it had to be divers he banged on the wall but didn't think they heard him then Harrison saw the light from one of the divers head torches as he swam through the hallway past the far end of the cabin unfortunately the diver was too quick and left the area before Harrison could reach him but then came the magical moment you may have seen the surreal amazing rescue footage from Niko's video when he sees what he believes is another dead body he touches the corpses hand in the hand unexpectedly squeezes his Nico has a momentary freakout as his supervisor Colby shouts through the microphone he's alive he's alive Colby then tells Nico to comfort Harrison by patting him on the shoulder and giving him a thumbs up sign the divers were amazed to find Harrison alive the maximum depth for recreational diving is 130 feet generally recreational divers don't stay at 100 feet for more than 20 minutes in terms of the air pocket the divers had reached Harrison just in time a human inhales roughly 350 cubic feet of air every 24 hours however because the boat was under pressure on the ocean floor scientists estimate that Harrison's air pocket had been compressed by a factor of about four if the pressurized air pocket were about two hundred sixteen cubic feet it would contain enough oxygen to keep Harrison alive for about two and a half days when Harrison was located he had been underwater for about 60 hours an additional danger came from the carbon monoxide or co2 build-up co2 is fatal to humans at a concentration of about 5% as Harrison breathed he exhaled carbon dioxide slowly increasing the levels of the gas in the nice face however co2 is absorbed by water and by splashing the water inside his air pocket Harrison inadvertently increased the water surface area thereby heightening the absorption of co2 and helping to keep the gas below the lethal 5% level the divers described Harrison is having co2 poisoning being short of breath and delirious when they found him he wouldn't have lasted much longer the divers first used hot water to warm Harrison up then fitted him with an oxygen mask meanwhile on the surface the dive support crew was in contact with medical and diving experts discussing how to best help the survivor Harrison had a new problem what divers commonly called the bends the bends also known as decompression sickness or caisson disease occurs when nitrogen bubbles form in the blood as a result of changes in pressure if Harrison ascended directly from 100 feet underwater to the surface of the ocean the bubbles in his blood would cause in the best case joint pain and rashes to the worst case paralysis neurological issues cardiac arrest or possibly even death it was decided that Harrison would be treated as if he were one of the saturation divers coming up after a dive Harrison spent about 20 minutes getting used to breathing through the mask then the divers put a diving helmet and harness onto him they were a little worried that he would panic as they got him out of the boat and would be a danger to the dive but Harrison continued to be cool under pressure the team was impressed with his level demeanor Harrison was taken from the boat and led to a diving bell which took him to the surface he finally arrived topside at around 7 p.m. on Tuesday the 28th of May disoriented Harrison thought that it was Sunday evening and that he had only been trapped for 12 hours he was shocked to learn that he'd been underwater for over two days from the diving bell Harrison was moved to a decompression chamber where he stayed for another two and a half days while his body decompressed a surface pressure of the 12 crew members on board the tugboat jasc on for divers rescued one survivor and recovered 10 of the bodies the search for the 11th crew member had to be called off due to dangerous conditions Harrison made a full recovery from his ordeal and returned to his hometown of wory Nigeria he didn't go to the funerals of his colleagues because he feared their family's reactions Nigerians can be very religious but are also superstitious some rumors spread that Harrison saved himself through black magic Harrison was also plagued with survivor's guilt wondering why he was the only one to live since the incident Harrison's experienced PTSD his wife AK Pavano Kenny says he suffers nightmares Harrison will suddenly awake screaming and flailing convinced that he's underwater Harrison has since taken a cooking job on dry land and vows to never again take a position on a boat he made a pact with God when he was at the bottom of the ocean when I was under the water I told God if you rescue me I will never go back to the sea again never one rainy day in the mid-1930s a peculiar young officer smartly paraded up to the front of his platoons formation and snapped into place with full military precision unlike the rest of his platoon however this particular officer was carrying an umbrella read in the face with anger and dripping wet and rain the battalion adjutant immediately stormed over and demanded to know what in the blue blazes the officer was thinking carrying an umbrella to formation without missing a beat the young officer simply responded because it's raining Sir John Malcolm Thorpe Fleming Churchill or as he would later be known Matt Jack or fighting Jack would be immediately reprimanded for his insubordination and preposterous Ness but such reprimands were nothing new for the very bored officer amidst the brief interlude of peace between World War one and World War two Churchill found his military service well rather dull a rare breed of man practically born to lead others on the battlefield Churchill itched for excitement and chaos when life failed to provide any he sought it out himself and at a time when roads were mostly non-existent in India rode his motorcycle over 1,500 miles of the Southeast Asian country set often crossing rivers and chasms by pushing his bike along the rails of railroad tracks while he carefully stepped across the crossbeams to ease his peacetime boredom Churchill also taught himself how to play the bagpipes which at the time was not a particularly popular pastime for proper British men but not one to half-ass anything Churchill will not only learn to play the bagpipes he would go on to play second in the officer's class of the piping championships at Aldershot a stunning feat considering he was the only Englishman amongst the 70 or so competitors bagpipes master Churchill also took up a keen interest in archery and became such a proficient Archer that he would go on to represent England in an international tournament Churchill may have been a daredevil in an adrenaline-junkie but that didn't mean he disliked comfort quite the opposite not only with Churchill earn himself a reprimand for bringing an umbrella to military formation in the pouring rain but he also was chastised for using a hot water bottle to keep warm at night in his cot against military protocol to bypass this minor technicality Churchill instead used a piece of rubber tubing which he filled with ha the rig's after all forbade the use of hot water bottles but said nothing about rubber tubes while most military men measure their alleged toughness by their ability to suffer hardship Churchill saw no need for such inane displays of machismo or perhaps he was as many sources state bored out of his mind by piece and entertained himself by annoying his senior leadership whatever the truth if anyone thought Churchill was a soft man because he preferred to stay dry in the rain and sleep in warm comfort they would be sorely mistaken as the world was about to find out with the outbreak of World War two in 1939 the German army invaded Poland from one side as the Russians invaded from another Polish defenders were caught between the two surging armies and quickly surrendered the hostilities prompted Britain and France to declare war on Germany and at last Churchill's long stretch of peace and boredom came to an end commenting that I was back in my red coat the country haven't gotten to a jam in my absence Churchill left behind his brief peacetime life of modeling and appearing in famous films as an extra to ship out to France however upon arriving Churchill was immediately disappointed despite German aggression against the pols and Britain and Frances declaration of war both nations simply took up positions along the French Maginot Line and did well nothing troops simply held their ground and generally try not to be bored for weeks upon weeks the lack of offensive operations being the result of Britain and France is lack of preparations for war what historians would end up calling a slight oversight Britain and France had completely failed to fully prepare for conflict despite years of ratcheting German aggression and a whole lot of angry tiny mustache chest pounding from Adolf Hitler whatever the case Churchill found himself a victim of allied on readiness a situation which did not suit him at all there was a war on damnit and like a puppy straining on the leash Churchill wanted his share of it with the Soviets invaded Finland Churchill joined a volunteer detachment of British soldiers sent to aid Finn forces they might not be Germans but fighting anyone who was being an Internet dick was better than fighting nobody Churchill supposed meeting his comrades adieu Churchill join to the finished detachment but before the expedition could get all the way to Finland it was canceled on account of some sudden and very severe German rudeness across the entire Maginot Line Finland would have to fend for itself against the Soviets at last the proper war was on returning to his comrades Churchill was immediately displeased at the British Army's failure to hold its ground against the overwhelming German blitzkrieg of tens of thousands of infantry thousands of Tanks and an equal number of fighters and bombers Churchill and his unit were then ordered to retreat making for Dunkirk where rescue awaited for the overwhelmed British and French forces and if that rescue failed the war could come to a very sudden and unpleasant end for the Allies more than a fair bit annoyed at having to retreat Churchill decided to creatively reinterpret his orders and rather than simply fall back and masse he engaged in an aggressive campaign of guerrilla raids and counter-attacks against the German forces leading small teams of hand-picked men Churchill would rush roaring a battle cry into battle holding aloft a large two-handed sword like some anachronistic Highlander Churchill waded into enemy fire and on more than one occasion spitted a German soldier on his claim or other times Churchill would discard his rifle in favor of his longbow singing barbed shafts into the chests of Germans up to a hundred yards away rumor has it that during one battle a German officer asked for a list of casualties and injuries only to be told that several of the casualties had been shot with arrows the confused and irate officer warned his junior officer not to joke around with him only to be shown the bodies with arrows still sticking out of them professional soldiers always expect the unexpected in combat but nobody expected a mad Englishman shooting arrows in the midst of the greatest Industrial Age war in human history during a lull in the fighting Matt Jack Churchill as he was now known was spotted by a fellow officer riding his signature motorcycle longbow on his back arrows sticking out of pack strapped to his body and a German officers cap on the motorcycles headlamp as Matt Jack dismounted the officer noted a streak of blood across his beard neck and asked about the fresh injury asking for a stiff drink in return Churchill responded that he and his had ran into a German machine gun and his men had screamed for him to run but he had simply been too tired to Churchill have thought it's simpler to destroy the machine gun nest even after being shot through the neck successfully making it across the channel back to England Churchill got wind of a new military organization being formed called the commandos the request for volunteers was secretive but promised aggressive military service which was more than good enough for Churchill the progenitors to Britain's modern Special Forces commando service included weeks of training and demolitions Firearms infiltration and all manner of other topics with Churchill absolutely adored during commando training however Churchill also met a woman whom he would immediately marry and remain happily married to for 55 years until his death on December 27th 1941 Churchill had his chance to rejoin the war as the newly formed commandos assaulted that German garrison at Volks in Norway tasked with destroying the onshore artillery in preparation for a full-scale assault Churchill stood in the leave landing craft with bagpipes belting out that March of the Cameron men as enemy machine guns strafe to the oncoming boats as soon as the ramp slower Churchill waded ashore ahead of his men holding aloft his sword and as one soldier put it puttering warlike cries a half hour later Churchill sent out a brief Telegraph to headquarters reading simply Molloy battery and Island captured casualties slight demolitions in progress Churchill Churchill would go on to win several military honors as well as more than a few battle scars but his greatest feats of Valor would not come until the autumn of 1943 leading the Allied landings at Salerno and Illya Churchill and his commandos found themselves fighting alongside American Rangers in the town of Marina both Churchill's commandos and the American Rangers were not designed to fight and operate as normal line infantry lacking much of the heavy fire support that normal infantry brings to a fight such as heavy machine guns and mortars armed mostly with rifles and grenades so that they could remain mobile the commandos and Rangers found themselves at a severe disadvantage as German and Italian heavy infantry assaulted their position in waves though casualties were extremely high the Allied forces beat back every assault growing bored of simply waiting for the Germans to come to him to get shot Churchill decided it would be best to go where they were instead and shoot them there ignoring the fact that his forces were grossly outnumbered and had no heavy weapons and absolutely zero support Churchill led a night raid against a heavily defended German position rushing out from thick undergrowth and shouting commando Churchill and his small detachment destroyed the German position and took 136 prisoners Churchill in one of his corporals however had managed to get themselves far ahead of the rest of their unit in fighting and suddenly heard the sound of dozens of Germans digging into fighting positions all around them in the nighttime darkness never one to waste a good opportunity Churchill decided that it wouldn't do to march back to friendly lines alone and instead unsheath his giant sword and simply walked to the first german position ordering the men to put their hands up in german perhaps thinking themselves visited by the ghost of an ancient medieval man or simply doubting that even their bullets would touch a man with balls of steel so sturdy he waded into battle carrying a giant freakin sore the Germans obliged and were taken prisoner Churchill however wasn't done he thought it wouldn't do for his German prisoners to be lonely and thus decided to visit another German physician by the end of the night Churchill and his corporal took 42 German prisoners leading him back to the British and American lines at sore point Churchill would go on to explain to a senior officer that as long as you tell the German loudly and clearly what to do if your senior to him he will cry yah vote and get on with it enthusiastically and efficiently whatever the situation that's why they make such marvelous soldiers a few months later however Churchill himself would be taken prisoner surrounded on all sides by Germans and with just six men and himself left alive and with nothing more than revolvers and a single American carbine between them Churchill fought on until the ammunition ran out and a mortar killed three of his other men and wounded another with nothing left to shoot back away and apparently separated from his trusty sword Churchill pulled out his bagpipes and prepared to meet his end playing will ye no come back again until a German grenade knocked him unconscious Churchill would be sent to a peel W Kent but was quickly growing bored not killing Germans he hastily made an escape upon his recapture he was sent to an even more well guard at Pio W camp only to escape again meeting up with a column of American Armour Churchill was rescued Paul to hear that the war was nearly over returning to his unit Churchill commented there are still nips aren't there and thus Churchill volunteered to ship off to the Pacific sadly for Churchill upon his arrival the Americans dropped their second nuclear bomb and the Japanese quickly surrendered a heartbroken Churchill would go on to say to a friend if it hadn't been for those damned Yanks we could have kept the war going on for another 10 years telling another friend that the Japanese had double-crossed him by surrendering Churchill immediately began to look for an opportunity to join the many brush wars raging in the aftermath of World War two he got his chance in 1948 when Arab forces tried to drive the Jews from what would become Israel present and his full dress uniform at a battalion parade Churchill got news that a Jewish medical convoy had been ambushed by Arab forces not wasting a moment Churchill immediately rushed to their aid still wearing full dress uniform boldly rushing down the middle of the road and into the teeth of the battle Churchill commented later that I grant like mad from side to side as people are less likely to shoot you if you smile at them Churchill would go on to rescue 700 Jewish civilians and earn greater military honors for his deeds at the end of the hostilities Churchill then went to teach at various military schools ending his career while serving as an instructor at the land air warfare school in Australia giving up on its many attempts to kill him life would let Churchill live out his days happily next to his wife until his peaceful death in 1996 leaving behind an extraordinary legacy of courage and well no small amount of lunacy best remembered for a signature claymore which he waded into battle with Churchill once answered a general awarding him a decoration who asked about the weapon by saying in my opinion sir any officer who goes into action without his sword is improperly dressed it's the closing days of the Second World War and despite defeat being in near certainty the German army is still fighting ferociously forcing Allied troops to pay for every inch of territory with their blood just outside the Fugees mountains an American infantry platoon is under heavy assault by a well-coordinated in armed German advance several m10 tank destroyers are lending their fire to the battle on the American side but one by one they're hit by German Panzer shrinks an anti-tank munition forcing their crews to abandon the vehicles amidst the chaos one soldier sees that his men are about to be overrun and he immediately orders them to make a break for the woods behind them to cover their retreat the soldier leaps up and rushes to a burning tank destroyer hopping atop it and Manning the 50 caliber machine gun standing alone against a horde of oncoming Germans just two years earlier Ally Murphy found himself being rejected for military service by first the army and then the Navy and finally the Marine Corps the five foot five inch would-be soldier was too short and underweight the military doctors all said plus to boot he was too young only 16 years old yet there was a war on and the pain of Pearl Harbor was still deeply felt by Murphy and most Americans plus the US had just suffered crushing defeats in the Philippines Murphy wanted to fight and he wasn't going to stop trying to enlist until he was allowed to faking his birth certificate with the help of his sister Murphy was finally accepted into the Army on the 30th of June 1942 taunted for his short stature Murphy nonetheless immediately proved a very capable soldier earning his marksman badge with rifle component bar an expert badge with bayonet component bar graduating from basic training Murphy was sent overseas to the Mediterranean theater acting as a platoon messenger in Algeria while the Allies trained for their upcoming assault landings and Sicily weeks later Murphy found himself on a speeding landing assault craft plowing through the stormy seas with swells several feet high a freak summer storm had sprung up overnight preventing a landing of paratroopers meant to strike the German defenders from behind and he is the pressure on the landing sites the weather was so bad however and the sea so violent that the German commanders relaxed their defenses thinking no Allied commander would be insane enough to risk and fibbys landings in such extreme wind and rain yet from out of the gloom in the howling wind there suddenly came the thunderous booming of battleship batteries raining death down amongst the German defensive positions and just behind the fiery onslaught where lines of Allied landing craft bringing 150,000 soldiers into the soft underbelly of axis hell Europe Murphy hit the beach with his men that day and while on a scouting patrol came across two fleeing Italian officers which he shot and killed having survived the violence of the initial landings though a severe illness sidelined Murphy and he was forced into a field hospital for a week rejoining his unit he was then sent to Salerno landing near bata paya where he and two other soldiers were ambushed by a German unit they're withering barrage immediately cut down one of the soldiers leaving Murphy and another soldier alone against the squad of five Germans firing at them from a fortified position responding with hand grenades in their own machine gunfire Murphy and is comrade killed all five Germans sadly too late to save the injured soldiers life one month later Murphy joined in the assault against the vaulter no line the southernmost line of German defenses meant to slow down the Allied assault into Italy there Murphy and his men repelled a counter-attack by seven German soldiers killing three and taking four prisoners for his leadership and excellence on the battlefield Murphy received a promotion to sergeant only to be promoted just one month later in January 1944 two staff sergeant and still only 19 years old hospitalized with malaria Murphy was out of action for a week and a half before rejoining his men at the First Battle of cisterna a disastrous American defeat that saw the loss of over 700 US Army Rangers as US forces lick their wounds Murphy found himself taking shelter in an abandoned farmhouse along with his unit suddenly a German Panzer discovered their position and Murphy crawled out alone on his belly drawing close enough to destroy the tank with rifle grenades for his incredible heroism Murphy was awarded the Bronze Star with V two months later Murphy found himself once more on a landing craft being tossed around the choppy seas as he sped to shore on the south of France the Normandy invasion had been successful and Allied forces from a now defeated Italy would join in the retaking of France by catching the Germans between northern and southern invasion squeezing the Nazis back into Germany under heavy fire the landing craft hit the beach and men rushed forward to destroy the German defenders firing down on them from fortified bunkers as the invasion force pushed out of the beaches Murphy and his platoon found themselves picking their way through a beautiful French vineyard a surreal moment of peace and calm amidst the incredible violence raging all around them however the peace was quickly shattered as German infantry opened fire on the Americans wounding and killing several Murphy squads machine gunner had been detached from the rest of his unit and desperately in need of some heavy suppressing fire Murphy braved the storm of bullets to retrieve the weapon and then incredibly rushed back into the fray and began returning fire killing two German soldiers suddenly the German fire slacked off and stopped and two German soldiers left their position inside a house with their hands up appearing to surrender Murphy's best friend responded and approached the soldiers ready to take them prisoner when suddenly Germans hiding inside the house opened fire killing him instantly in a fit of rage Murphy stormed the house completely alone as the Germans poured fire in his direction incredibly Murphy avoided being hit and armed with only his rifle killed six Germans wounded two and took eleven prisoner for his and his men's heroism that day and in the following days Murphy and his unit received the Presidential Unit Citation Murphy's seemingly invulnerability however came to an end when on the 15th of September 1944 he was wounded by a mortar glass shrapnel cutting deep into his heel just a few weeks later though Murphy was back in action and would earn a Silver Star for assaulting a German machine gun position killing four and wounding three just three days later engaging the Germans at looma in the clear a river valley Murphy and his unit found themselves unable to take a heavily defended Hill from their German defenders crawling alone forward toward the German position where he could get a better vantage point Murphy directed his men and their assault via radio even while Germans rained machine gun and rifle fire down on him for over an hour after successfully taking the hill Murphy earned a oak leaf cluster for his Silver Star at a battlefield commission to second lieutenant joining the assault into the heart of France Murphy and his platoon were ambushed by German snipers on the 26th of October picking his way from cover to cover Murphy managed to make his way right up to the German position taking two of the soldiers prisoner while suddenly a third sniper shot him in the hip spinning on his attacker Murphy levelled his rifle and put one round directly between the snipers eyes for his injury Murphy received his first bronze oak leaf cluster for his Purple Heart but partial loss of his hip muscle due to the removal of gangrene from the wound forced Murphy out of combat until January by that time though the Allies were pushing the Germans steadily back and out of France joining his men at the Colmar pocket in the Buju mountains near central France Murphy and his men found themselves in the thick of some of the most brutal fighting of the war determined to force the Allies back into the sea a fierce German counter-attack broke on the US lines like a storm caught out in the open Murphy called for any fire support available to prevent the Germans over running their position a detachment of m10 tank destroyers responded and immediately began engaging the Germans however German fire quickly began eliminating the vehicles one by one firing from a hastily prepared defensive position the blast of a panzerschreck striking an m10 just feet away rolled over Murphy knowing his men would be killed to the last if they remained out in the open Murphy ordered his men to make a break for the woods behind them remaining at his position alone he fired at the oncoming Germans while also directing artillery fire over the radio Murphy knew he needed to lay down some heavy suppressing fire if his men were going to have any chance of making it to safety but he was armed with only his m1 rifle that's when Murphy spotted the 50 caliber machine gun atop that destroyed m10 and ignoring the flames smoke an incoming German fire all around him Murphy made a mad dash for the burning wreck and crawl the topic Manning the heavy machine-gun and laying down a withering barrage of fire at the oncoming Germans for over an hour Murphy state atop the burning vehicle returning fire against the Germans in advancing vehicles the mighty 50 caliber machine gun nicknamed Madhu's by US forces belched out high-speed death shredding even the armor of the German vehicles wound in both legs and finally out of ammunition after over 60 minutes of fighting Murphy finally left the burning wreck and crawled his way back to his men in the woods behind him having killed and wounded 50 Germans and knocking out several German vehicles Murphy ignored the wounds to his legs and led his men in an assault to repel the German counter-attack pushing the enemy back and securing the u.s. position on guard against the second counter-attack Murphy refused to be evacuated to a field hospital and remained with his men as his wounds were treated for his heroism that day Murphy was awarded the US military's highest decoration the Medal of Honor given only in the most extreme cases of gallantry and heroism his wounds proved to be too great to rejoin the fighting this time however and Murphy was moved from the front lines to regimental headquarters to act as an army liaison officer a well-deserved rest for an incredible soldier Audie Murphy would ultimately become one of the most highly decorated soldiers in US history and even earned several awards and citations from the French and Belgium governments for heroism unable to continue service due to his injuries how'd he left the military at the end of the war and began a very successful career as a Hollywood actor starring in several films featuring his own exploits in combat sadly Murphy would go on to be killed in a plane crash on the 28th of May 1971 though his body would be interred in Arlington National Cemetery where remains one of the most visited graves in a field of bamboo and tall grass the wind picks up and sways the long grasses for a few moments in those precious moments an American sniper dressed head to toe in a camouflage ghillie suit hinges forward a few centimeters when the wind dies he stops dead in his tracks and will not move forward again until there's a fresh breeze if no wind comes though he resolves himself to continue toward his target a mile and a half away by crawling at the incredible rate of 12 inches an hour his moves are so slow and methodical that even the local wildlife fails to spot him and deer feed directly in front of and around him a deadly Viper slithers past and over the American soldier completely oblivious to the snipers presence four days later his agonizingly slow crawl will be complete and his high-value target a North Vietnamese general will be dead a single round through his chest compliments of the white feather Carlos Hathcock the legendary Vietnam War sniper Carlos Hathcock grew up learning how to shoot and dreamed of being a u.s. Marine his entire life hearing of the heroic tales of valor performed by American Marines in places such as Okinawa Midway and Guadalcanal at just 17 years old he joined the US Marines and in 1965 six years later he won the Wimbledon Cup shooting championship designating as one of the top marksmen in the United States in 1965 President Johnson ordered ground troops to Vietnam and signaled the start of the American ground war against the North Vietnamese and their Vietcong allies a year later Hathcock was deployed to Vietnam where he would serve as a military policeman but upon arriving he immediately volunteered for combat duty given his incredible marksmanship he was transferred to the first Marine sniper platoon at the time stationed at Hill 55 south of Danang so near the frontlines Hathcock would very quickly put his elite shooting skills to use and he even went so far as to wear a white feather on his Bush hat so as to dare the North Vietnamese to spot him a move that would earn him his a lifelong nickname half-cocked who assumed dispatching enemy snipers and his preferred time to hunt was sunrise and sundown as he'd go on to explain later first light and last light are the best times in the morning they're going out after a good night's rest smoking laughing when they come back in the evenings they're tired lollygagging and not paying attention to detail half [ __ ] would take advantage of the drop in the enemy's guard during these crucial hours to great effect scoring 93 confirmed kills in over 300 unconfirmed kills his skills soon made him a unit trainer and he started training other snipers on how to move silently through the thick jungle marksmanship skills and the all-important art of camouflage his skills would soon be put to the ultimate test when a top-secret mission came down the pipe and Hathcock volunteered for it remarking that he knew nothing about the details except that it was extremely dangerous and extremely important that mission turned out to be the elimination of a North Vietnamese Army general an all-important link in the command and control chain of the North Vietnamese Army which had so far eluded capture or destruction all the Americans had to go on was some rough intel that said the general was safely tucked away in a large North Vietnamese encampment though they didn't know where exactly hathcock's job would be to do uh platoons of infantry and squadrons of strike aircraft couldn't do sneak up to the encampment locate the general and eliminate him for days he hiked through the thick bush in the direction of the encampment avoiding North Vietnamese patrols the entire way this would be a solo mission he turned down a spotter fearing that any additional soldiers accompanying him would only increase the odds of discovery deep down inside the mission felt like a suicide mission and Hathcock did not want to endanger fellow Marines if he could help it at last Hathcock arrived to the target area and here he had to make a choice thick woods surrounded the camp on three sides and would be the most obvious approach for a sniper as it gave the best cover and concealment however that was exactly why half-cock opted not to make approach from the thick woods it would be the most expected Avenue of attack and if he made his shot it would be directly where enemy forces would head trying to flush him out instead Hathcock opted to approach the camp from a different direction an area of grassland that offered some cover in the form of bamboo shoots and tall grasses but in many places offered little to no cover as the grass thin to a casual observer the fourth approach was completely suicidal but hancock was confident in his abilities to remain undetected he would need to move in to at least 700 yards to make his shot and that would mean that he needed to cross over 1,500 yards of open ground to get into a good shooting position to do this Hathcock stashed most of his equipment and loaded himself only with several canteens of water his rifle and a few rounds of ammunition then he began to low crawl to his objective using a technique he called worming which saw him moved forward at the painfully slow rate of just inches every hour this would make his movements so impossibly slow that they would be all but imperceptible to the enemy half gog covered his full body in a ghillie suit which would seem to be nothing more than another mound of grass and it would take someone with a photographic memory to notice the incredibly gradual change in the landscape as he crawled forward for four days and three nights Carlos went without food or sleep inching ever closer even animals were unaware of his presence with wild boar and deer grazing just inches away at one point a deadly Viper slithered next to him and over him a single bite enough to kill him in seconds Hathcock simply froze and let the Viper pass on then continued on his own way as he neared the camp half-cock began penetrating the outer defences patrols of enemy soldiers walked by just a few feet away from him completely unaware of the snipers presence and at one point a soldier nearly tripped over him finally he crawled between two heavy machine gun positions and changed his crawling technique so that now he was crawling on his side so as to leave an even smaller trail behind him then finally on the fourth day the general stepped out into his front porch and yond a second later hathcock's bullet had pierced his heart the camp erupted in alarms and all the soldiers rushed to the thickly wooded tree lines ringing the camp searching for half [ __ ] for three days meanwhile half [ __ ] simply crawled back home the way he had come completely clear of any enemy activity path [ __ ] second most famous kill would be his showdown against a Vietcong commander known as Apache a sniper himself Apache had earned her nickname for scalping American POWs and for her brutality as an interrogator an extremely sadistic woman she took great pleasure in torturing American soldiers and in November of 1966 half-cock found himself in her backyard earlier that month the Apache had captured a young marine private and then tortured him for a day and a half within earshot of his own unit Hathcock was also there and he could hear the screams from the soldier as the Apache skinned the private alive cut off his eyelids tore out his fingernails and then finally castrated him with a knife the soldier was then released to crawl back to his unit but though Hathcock attempted to save him the young private ended up dying in the bush pass Cox were right then and there that he would kill Apache he and his spotter hid the thick bush and began moving to locate Apache and her unit of elite snipers the game was a deadly one not only was Apache a very skilled sharpshooter but so were all the men under her command yet it would be Apache who would make the fatal mistake when one day her unit popped out of the thick jungle and onto a trail for just a moment Apache squatted so she could pee though her soldiers urged her to get back up and keep moving at that very moment hathcock's bullet dropped her from 700 yards away and as she lay dying he put a second round through her just for good measure by this time hathcock's reputation had grown to a legendary status and the North Vietnamese had taken note American snipers were very hated by the Vietnamese due to their deadly efficiency and Bounty's ranging from $8 to $2,000 replaced on the heads of American snipers yet Hathcock broke all records with an incredible bounty of $30,000 to whoever could kill him many Vietnamese snipers tried to collect and Hathcock killed them all one Vietnamese sniper with a legendary reputation of his own was eventually sent to dispatch Hathcock a soldier by the name of the Cobra the Cobra had kills as impressive as Hathcock often striking targets deep inside American camps and then disappearing into the jungle perhaps as a warning to Hathcock of his arrival the Cobra struck at the camp he was staying at and killed a gunnery sergeant Hathcock watched the man die and swore right then and there that he would eliminate the Cobra baiting half-cock into a fight the Cobra began to kill many Marines around the encampment over the following few days Hathcock and his partner took off into the jungle after the Cobra and for days the three men played a deadly game of cat and mouse at one point Hathcock made a nearly fatal mistake and leaned against a rotted tree for support but the rot had eaten through the tree and Hathcock fell over giving himself away the Cobra immediately fired and struck hathcock's Partners can team making the man believe that he'd been hit due to the warm liquid spreading down his leg continuing their deadly pursuits Hathcock managed to work around to the Cobras position forcing the Vietnamese soldier to move to hathcock's old position with the Sun dropping in the sky this put the Cobra in a very perilous position and sure enough as half-cock scanned the jungle in front of him he saw the tell-tale glint of sunlight off a rifle scope without hesitating Hathcock squeezed the trigger the Cobra was dead as half-cock and his partner made their way to the Cork's they were shocked to discover that half [ __ ] bullet had actually traveled cleanly through the rifle scope and into the Cobras eye so accurate a shot that the bullet didn't even graze the sides of the scope this was only possible though if the Cobra had been aiming directly at half [ __ ] at the same time that half [ __ ] was aiming at him meaning that half [ __ ] had cheated death by fractions of a second being just a hair faster on the trigger than the Cobra in 1969 hathcock's time in Vietnam would come to an end when a vehicle he was riding in struck a landmine Hathcock was struck unconscious briefly and when he came to he started helping to pull wounded Marines out of the burning vehicle receiving third-degree burns over large parts of his body with this sniper career over Hathcock established the Marine sniper school at Quantico where he dedicated the rest of his career to teaching Marines how to become deadly snipers he would go on to die in 1999 at the age of 56 from multiple sclerosis the disease managing to do what the vietnamese never could you wake up one day and I feel a bit groggy the last thing you remember is flying out to Eastern Europe and having a great time sightseeing and then there's some vague memories of a drug deal gone south with a bunch of Russian gangsters and their leader smiling sinisterly while saying perhaps it's time our friends here have a dirt nap he left his gangsters laughed in what you originally thought was a pork use of American idioms turned out to be quite literal now you're six feet underground and stuck inside a coffin how are you gonna get out of this one being buried alive is a pretty common fear and in 2018 of shocking 15% of people buried at a cemetery were in fact buried alive by mistake just kidding we made that up just to panic our more claustrophobic fans who should actually feel a lot better knowing that being buried alive is so rare that there's no official stat for how often it happens of course it has happened and back in the 1800s the fear was so prevalent that special coffins were made available which came with a length of string tied to a bell above the grave if someone happened to find they've been pronounced dead prematurely all they would have to do is ring the bell again though we weren't able to find any verified claims of this ever actually happening but what if it did happen to you first we're gonna be straight up with you and let you know that freeing yourself is going to take a lot of luck and be incredibly difficult so difficult in fact that right this very second millions of people could very well be trying to desperately claw their way to freedom from an early grave only to die of asphyxiation so who knows maybe 15% of people really are buried alive I mean we researched it and there's no official way of checking if a buried corpses you know in actual corpse if your family opted for embalming though then you have nothing to worry about because if you weren't dead before the mortician got his hands on you you definitely are after he suctions out all your blood and replaces it with a witch's brew of chemicals embalming however is not legally mandated and instead your family could ask that you be refrigerated until the funeral service this is a cheaper alternative to embalming and will help keep you crisp and semi fresh so your family has a chance to say goodbye without you looking like a walking dead extra if you've seen our previous episode on the man who survived being frozen for 12 hours then you're already a where that chillin a body can actually help keep it alive the chilling can slow your cellular activity to the point that you require very little oxygen and your heart can be very very sparingly and still keep you alive odds are though that if you're buried alive then you've probably been involved in some shady business with the Russian mob who coincidentally find it a great laughs to bury their enemies alive inside coffins and listen to them try to claw their way out in this case believe it or not you have a very thin chance of survival so what can you do step 1 calm down you ever been told that calm down in the middle of a fight remember how it only made you a lot angrier well this time you're gonna have to actually calm down waking up inside a coffin is going to be a pretty traumatic and terrifying experience and in all honesty we wouldn't blame you for freaking out but whatever you do don't that's because when you're being hysterical with a boyfriend or girlfriend and get told to calm down you can afford to completely ignore the advice thanks to all the free oxygen you're gulping down in your outrage inside a buried coffin though you're working on a very strict oxygen budget and if you woke up inside the coffin then that means you've been lazily sleeping for who knows how long and gulping down oxygen by the mouthfuls the entire time freaking out is only gonna increase your oxygen intake and do you very little good it's time to clear your mind and try meditating focus on slowing your breathing and stay in control of your emotions step 2 take inventory this might sound like a no-brainer but once you've calmed down check the inside of your coffin maybe you have a pocketknife that would be great or a belt buckle or literally anything else that's very hard and rigid you could use a belt buckle to tap rhythmically on the lid of your confident hope that someone above can hear you if you were accidentally buried alive then there's a good chance there's still someone up above paying their last respects or putting the finishing touches on your grave if you have a pocketknife it's going to come in handy for trying to break your way out of the coffin increasingly though people are being buried with cellphones either by accident or on purpose so that loved ones can call the corpse yeah we also don't get that one but hey to each their own if you happen to have a cell phone on you then try dialing out there's a small chance you'll have reception if your carrier is t-mobile than for get it you're screwed step 3 prepare to bust out okay you have no cell phone or you foolishly opted for a contract with t-mobile which means you have no reception inside your coffin or anywhere else really it's time to get out first let's just say that if you've been buried in a steel lined coffin then forget it it's over for you remember that pocketknife you have two choices here the fast way out or slow lingering asphyxiation but let's say you got buried in a much cheaper wooden coffin or a budget model made out of very rigid cardboard this is one time you're going to be grateful to your family for being a bunch of cheapskates what you're gonna want to do is make a hole in the coffin through which you'll crawl out but first you have to protect your ability to breathe take your shirt and lift it up over your head so that it covers your head like when two hockey players get into a fight this will make a hood that your head fits inside of and will keep dirt out and help you have some oxygen as you crawl upwards step four bust out and take revenge on the living all right you've got your shirt over your head to help you maintain some breathing air as you claw our way to freedom through several feet of dirt or at least so you look hilariously ridiculous when they eventually dig you up a few years later now you want to feel for the center of the lid of your coffin this will be the weakest point structurally because science it'll be difficult in the cramped spaces but you want to start hammering away at this point and while you won't be able to actually bust out you can flex the lid enough that hopefully the weight of the dirt above it will crack it once you've accomplished this tear away at the wood or heavy cardboard and push all the incoming dirt to the bottom of your coffin while trying to wriggle your body so that your head doesn't get stuck in place you're gonna have to make like a worm and wriggle continuously to push the dirt aside and hopefully down while widening the opening and the lip in time you should be able to have made a large enough hole that you can start making your way upwards and this is actually the easy part since you were recently buried then all that dirt is going to be very loose and pretty easy to dig through of course it's all going to be compacting your little bubble of air supply so you're gonna have to move fast once you've busted out to take a well-deserved breath of fresh air now you're free to freak out all you want breaking free completely will take some time but with enough wriggling you should eventually manage to your arms loose and then you can simply pull yourself up to freedom you've done it you've come back from the grave like a completely predictable twist on AMC's The Walking Dead and how it's time to get a second lease on life or at the very least to change your phone carriers welcome to another video when we pit someone or something that has extraordinary strengths and abilities against a regular Joe such as yourself today we're talking about Thanos one of the most formidable bad boys in the Marvel Universe he first showed his ugly face in the comic the invincible Iron Man number 55 and has since been a fairly regular fixture you might also have seen him in a number of Marvel movies and he'll appear in the upcoming Avengers end game the creator of this villain jim Starlin quite amusing Lee once said he got the idea while studying psychology and anger management yep Thanos sure has a problem controlling his rage but now let's have a look at his backstory before we get into the actual fight indeed if you look at Marvel Cinematic Universe fansite you'll see that he would have been interesting work for any psychologist he's described as being powerful extremist genocidal psychopathic violent and tyrannical also known as the Dark Lord mad Titan or even the most powerful being in the universe he's understandably a bit of a handful he was born on Titan one of many of Saturn's modes just so you know according to NASA Saturn has 62 confirmed moons but a few more could be added to that list soon Titan is special as it has its own atmosphere Thanos is the son of Eternals tars and soui son and he has a brother called eros he carries something called the deviants gene and this somewhat helped shape his appearance after his birth his mother was so taken aback by his appearance that she tried to kill him the father prevented this from happening but perhaps some of phantoms darker aspects can be explained by how he was treated and how he looked he was friendly enough during his early days in school but kept to himself and mainly just hung out with his brother and his pets but then as he got older he became fascinated with death and aspects of nihilism a philosophical belief that life has no inherent value purpose or higher meaning but then he finds meaning later in life when he becomes obsessed with mistress death the personification of death itself chasing after her is his wrestling data and there is nothing he wouldn't do for her we might also add that Venice was not always portrayed as an out mountain villain you see when he was living on Titan there were way too many people and just not enough resources Venice had the idea just to kill half the people and the problem would be solved that didn't go down well with his people of course he didn't perform the great call and then he was proved right Titan was overrun in devastated and the Titan people almost became extinct over his long history the story has changed many times but you can read in the comics how mistress death got Thanos to wipe out half the universe she said there were too many living people and not enough dead people and asked him to get the job done Thanos believe this to be true having seen what happened on his own planet he thought sending off half the universe to an early grave would be an act of love in some ways we should add that mistress death was also around from time to time to bring him back from what seemed like certain death Thanos wants to exterminate half the universe because he thinks he's doing a good thing that's based on his belief that there are not enough resources to go around the simple solution is to just get rid of many beings he commands armies and he has many followers he seeks to find the Infinity stone so he can succeed in this plan if you don't already know the stones are 6 elemental crystals that hold an important aspect of the universe these stones were the creation of the cosmic entities and they each hold immense power so for many years Thanos goes looking for these stones and that gets him into a lot of trouble while often making alliances on the way he becomes a very feared tyrant because if he came to your planets he might see to it that he left with half the population yet it would be an understatement to say that os-- is a hard man to keep down he comes up against the best there are including head-to-head with Thor the Avengers the Masters of the mystic arts the guardians of the galaxy and the nation of Wakanda he eventually wins in his last big fight and with us snap of his fingers the universe is depopulated he has no misgivings sounding at times like German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche Nietzsche once said what doesn't kill you makes you stronger Thanos wants uh turd the dictum flesh is weak weakness must be cast aside for the sake of power for Pharaoh's power and sometimes ruthlessness had to be embraced for the greater good destruction was as necessary as creation he even had his adopted daughters nebula and Gomorrah fight and when nebula lost he removed part of her body because he said this would make her stronger so did this crazy tough loving tyrant ever lose a fight well as some of you might know he once came up against the forces of Wakanda who were backed up by some of the members of the Avengers and the guardians of the galaxy and he makes fairly easy work of them this ends with the mad tyrant putting the sixth and last stone in the gauntlet and harnessing the power of the universe thus making him omnipotent as we said the end product is Thanos achieving what he always wanted to do get rid of half the universe he saw this as imperative to saving the other half but we might ask if there was an alternative solution Thanos didn't seem to think so kind of hailing himself as an unsung hero once saying the hardest choices require the strongest wills that's basically saying it's a dirty job but someone has to do it then was occurred an injury but he seemed happy enough after killing half of all beings what we usually see in such stories is the bad guy losing but then was proved he had almost unstoppable power but if you go back through all the comics Thanos had his behind handed to him on many occasions in 2005 you might have seen him losing a fight to squirrel girl while Drax the destroyer once killed him by ripping out his heart Adam warlock once turned him into stone and that held him back for a while but as we said when you have mistress death in your corner there are often ways of getting resurrected he's also been killed as a clone and even as a zombie Thanos and on many other occasions when his anger and nihilism got the better of him what is so often his downfall is his devotion to mistress death and she seems at times to enjoy playing with his sometimes misguided mind in fickle heart vanos might be the strongest of them all but he has an Achilles heel his heart and ego when people were asked thanos might be defeated in upcoming movies seeing as he played so many people to waste in the last one a few folks had some ideas at this point we have an already almost unbeatable villain who now has been made even stronger with cosmic cubes and Infinity stones he's been made to look like he can't lose but as we know everyone loses sometimes the closest we saw him to being badly hurt in the movies was when Thor hit him in the chest with his Stormbreaker we at least know that he has a weakness and perhaps as some pundits have said someone will rustle up some kind of weapon in the upcoming movie and that weapon will be the end of Thanos after all everything so far has been thrown vanos and nothing worked for absol take some magic from the tool makers and who knows what will be created we looked at what people were saying on forums about how to beat Thanos and some of the answers were amusing one person said the Avengers will have to appeal to Thanos is rather large ego telling him to fight them without using all those powerful stones perhaps Thanos might just do it to prove he can win but we doubt this will happen there's also the fact that the Infinity Gauntlet might not always wield the power that was required to wipe out half the universe without its full power and the fact that he was hurt this might mean he could be defeated as many others have said why didn't Thor just aim for the head and not the chest others are not so positive with one person writing the Avengers essentially cannot be Thanos with the gauntlet he kills half the universe regardless of power with a mere thought he could literally end reality with the dollar and with that in mind how could you beat Thanos well as you don't have superpowers and you are up against a person that can destroy just about everything in the universe this is not gonna be an easy fight in fact let's just forget about having a traditional fight and think about heart mind ego and hubris so let's have a look at the name Thanos and his brother arrows if you know your Greek mythology you'll know that there were two characters with a similar name and the same name the first was finatus the personification of death the second was eros the God of love and desire the Marvel Comics just based their characters names on ancient Greek characters we might also note that psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud said that people are controlled by both a death Drive than dose a drive toward ultimate destruction but also a drive to create which was based on arrows okay so if we're sticking with Greek myths we might acknowledge that vanos is lacking in the arrows Department he's been devoted to mistress death but that's almost like looking in a mirror perhaps your only chance of defeating Thanos is to teach him to love to show them love it's a course of action that hasn't been taken in the movies but as a mere human one of your only chances of not losing against this thing is by changing his very reason for living you must transform the nihilist through your wise words and make him become an idealist to believer in the higher power of love them.i of course just get you squished into a ball and thrown off the edge of a cliff there have been some angry people on the planet that seemed had no spots to change the hate and fury is in the blood in the very marrow of the bones okay so what's next in that case as a mere human you must try and trick Thanos we can look at Greek mythology again and think about the word hubris when we talk about hubris now we mean arrogance overconfidence too much pride a boastful ego which more often than not ends with a downfall this could be good news for you and let's not forget that in mythologies wily humans have beaten Giants in the past now the one thing you have going for you and your fight with Thanos is the fact that his arrogance would be so high after beating everyone and fulfilling his objectives that you could not possibly be a threat to him now you must appeal to his ego and it's likely he'll let you close because as we said you could not possibly hurt him in his eyes you become his friend and tell him you're devoted to him this is a great advantage since you might be able to get so close you could get your hands on the Infinity Gauntlet okay so that might vaporize you but it might not remember that dr. strange a human has touched one of the great stones get your hands on this and you might have the power of the universe you were like a Trojan horse your feebleness made Thanos put his guard down and because you stroked his ego he took a liking to you then WHAM you ain't his life just as he ended millions of others [Music] believe it or not there's a fairly long list of people who have survived their executions we might look at the case of William do L a 17 year old English boy who was hanged in 1740 in London and then came back to life as he was about to be dissected he was later exiled to North America then you had John Babic only another Englishman nicknamed the man they couldn't hang after surviving three executions more recently you have the case of Romell broom an American man sentenced to death by lethal injection he survived that ended up writing a book called survivor on death row but it seems he spoke too early as he's scheduled for another execution in 2020 but today we'll talk about one of the best-known survivor stories in this episode of the infographic show death row inmate who survived his own execution as we've said a handful of people have survived their executions you can read quite recent cases - such as American inmates Doyle Lee ham who was said to have experienced torturous and traumatic hours in the execution chamber before staff admitted that they had failed the US media reported in 2017 that a man called Alva Campbell became the third man to survive an execution in the country in recent decades and that was just a matter of the execution team not being able to find a vein in which to inject the lethal drugs but perhaps the tale we're about to tell you now is the most moving as the person that survived was only 17 years old it's also the first case of someone surviving the electric chair in the USA if you've seen our show on old Sparky you'll know that executions in the early days could certainly be horrific to watch but eventually the inmates succumb to the shock that was not the case for 17 year-old Willie Francis let's have a look at what events led to him ending up in the chair Francis was a young poor african-american in 1946 and at the time of his lucky escape many people believed that the hand of God had interrupted this McCobb spectacle of official murder for one thing he was just so young and a lot of people to create the execution of a boy not yet a man and another thing was the fact that the American justice system at the time could have been said to be harsh for certain people of certain races and certain social standing he lived in a place called st. martinville located in southwestern Louisiana you could read articles about this place in the 40s with one saying that the town had two sections one for the white people and the other for the color the white tended to their own business and the color tend to theirs yes this was a time when racism was pervasive in some parts of the US and despite the backwards attitudes of some people there was a lot of support for young Willie when he was condemned to death after the botched execution attempt Francis wrote from his prison cell a lot of people write me to ask me to tell them something about what I did when I was young I'm only 18 now so I guess they mean when I was very young but what had he done one of 13 children Francis said life was hard as a kid but he wrote he had fond memories of the hard-knock life playing baseball with a broomstick handle and going out with friends causing mischief when he got older he was given a job by a man called Andrew Thomas Thomas owned the local drugstore hiring Francis to do errands and keep the store tiny they apparently got along and Francis was called a nice boy and cooperative by folks who visited the store he was however called illiterate by some or at least close to that other said he was slow but later when Francis was writing from his prison cell it was proven that he could not just write but express himself in a deep and meaningful way we're telling you this because this case was very controversial and at the time and for years after people tried to understand why this seemingly nice kid committed a murder that murder was of the drugstore owner Thomas when her son was convicted of slaying his boss the mother told the press there wasn't no band in him I just don't understand quite a few people thought that this young boy perhaps somewhat mentally challenged had admitted guilt to something he didn't do the murder of Andrew Thomas described as a handsome educated bachelor with his own successful business he was killed at his home during that night of November 7th 1944 his body was discovered the next day displayed on the floor near the house steps to witnesses Alvin and Ida Van Brocklin had said that they heard gunshots in the night they didn't see who did the firing though it was later said that Thomas had been dining with friends and upon returning home had been met by a gunman who unloaded five bullets in him to hit him in the back two in his left side and one went right through his eye it said his pockets had been emptied prompting police to say the reason for the murder was robbery rumors spread around town it said he was quite the ladies man and many speculated he had been killed by one of those ladies husbands or lovers for months people believed this to be the case some time later police were looking for a drug dealer and it said that Willie Francis just happened to see the police he wasn't dealing drugs but it said that when he saw the two white police officers running his way he just took off out of fright that was a mistake as running made the police think that he was guilty of something later Francis was interviewed by cops at the police station they said he seemed frightened and he stuttered a lot but it turned out that Francis had stuttered his whole life the cops didn't think that they had captured a drug dealer that they had been looking for but guess what they found on Francis they found Andrew Thomas's wallet and identification card that's what they say it anyway it said that within three to five minutes the police got a full confession for the murder of Thomas they also managed to get a confession for an unrelated assault and robbery in another town the facts cops did this in a few minutes and the fact that the boy was said to be somewhat slow would compel people to ask if the interrogation and subsequent confessions were perhaps a part of a setup Francis was questioned without a lawyer without any advice without any family member or friend being present the confession read I Willie Francis now 16 years old I stole the gun from mr. Agassi at st. martinville Louisiana and kill Andrew Thomas November 9th 1944 or about that time at st. martinville Louisiana it was a secret about me and him I took a black purse with card one two eight zero one eight two in it four dollars in it he wrote a second confession the next day this will contain more details about how many shots had been fired and where the body was found as for the trial it said Francis's lawyers were inept one writer says they never questioned for indictment nor do they make a motion for a change of venue despite the widespread publicity about the murder of a beloved white member of a small community by a black youth the 12 white jurors found him guilty and he was to be executed Frances lawyers never challenged the verdict by the way Francis has pleaded not guilty the jury never heard any argument pertaining to the possibility of a forced confession or that evidence could have been planted the confession itself was good enough for him to be convicted many people in the town thought that something smelled funny as did many others across the u.s. the local press wrote quote throughout the trial the Negro was uninterested and showed very little emotion unquote Francis wrote that he was concerned that he might act like a crybaby on the day of his execution but was relieved that the actual execution would only tickle on May 3rd 1946 he had his head shaved and prepared to have 2500 volts of electricity flow through him on his cell wall it was discovered that he had written the words of course I am NOT a killer police never did have a motive for the murder nor any substantial evidence other than the confession of a slow 16 year old boy he was taken to Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola to be put in the chair nicknamed gruesome gertie the lever was pulled and this is how Frances later described the feeling I couldn't stop the jumping if that was tickling it sure was a funny kind I thought for a minute I was going to knock the chair over then I was all right I thought I was dead other reports state that he shouted take it off take it off as the executioner's tried to give him a second round of shocks it said that after the failed attempt he wasn't even injured but he said he felt kind of busy some people said this was a miracle and a righteous one as they didn't believe that he was guilty nor had had a fair trial Louisiana's governor James Davis then said in six days they would send him to the chair again that didn't happen and much of America got behind the young man he once wrote I felt just like a movie star I didn't have any idea I had so many friends he also later described how his execution felt and something he called the chair he wrote you feel like you got a mouth full of cold peanut butter and you see little blue and pink and green speckles the kind that shines in a roosters tail what ensued were many months of legal arguments not only did some people believe he wasn't even but lawyers now argued that to subject a person to a second execution was cruel and unusual punishment prosecution lawyers argued against that stating the first attempt had not worked at all and he had not been hurt but the evidence supporting this in hindsight seems pretty weak the court also heard that the bot was just an accident and such accidents happen for which no man is to blame that meant no one was at fault and there should be another execution we might also note that later the state was petitioned with lawyers stating this about the botched execution the scene was a disgraceful and inhuman exhibition that as soon as the switch controlling the current was taken off the drunken executioner cursed Frances and told him he would be back to finish electrocuting him and if the electricity did not kill him he would kill him with a rock the drunken men in charge that night were accused of being sadistic not giving Frances the full shock because they wanted to torture him he was then returned to the chair may 9th 1947 and this time he didn't survive he was just 18 years old if anything positive came out of all of this it's the fact that the justice system was exposed for not supporting Francis in the first place this poor black boy may or may not have killed his boss but he certainly wasn't protected as he should have been by the American justice system many Americans of all colors saw and criticized what had happened in the spring of 2009 72 year-old procs sanchez was having trouble hearing and also experiencing earrings a hearing specialist sent him to get an MRI just after the scan started procs felt an excruciating pain under his right eye meanwhile the technician stopped the tests saying that they were experiencing interference from the metal in his head procs was puzzled he didn't have any metal in his head or so he thought the doctors looked at an older CT scan of proxy's head and were shocked to find something metal the size of a toothpick in the images while leaving the doctor's office procs suddenly coughed up a 1-inch nail the giant magnet and the MRI machine had dislodged a nail that was stuck in Praxis sinus cavity sending it down his throat doctors thought he might have had the nail stuck in his head for 30 years the doctors also told procs when he sniffed up the nail membrane tissue probably formed around it the nail might have stayed there forever without the MRI although procs did carpentry he was bewildered as to how he got a nail up his nose without noticing it some very odd and disturbing things have been found in the human body quite often by medical professionals before we go any further let's discuss what this video is not about human beings sometimes have unusual shall we say inclinations which can lead to needing medical assistance to remove items from the lower part of their intestinal system as many medical professionals who work in an emergency room can tell you some patients seem to have carefully thought-out explanations where somehow they accidentally fell on various objects and those items got stuck there visiting the hospital for a rectal foreign body removal procedure because they're unable to remove the item on their own frankly we could spend a whole video discussing this topic but there are many forum discussions and x-ray pictures online that give veracity to such anecdotes however we have provided a short list called from the internet of items which have been removed during medical exams or in some cases emergency surgery admittedly most of these items aren't disturbing as of themselves it's only when you think where they were found the disturbing factor comes into play Barbie doll Buzz Lightyear action figure candle candy cane carrot cellphone champagne flute cucumber egg eggplant flashlight fork golf ball impulse body spray perfume glass bottle jar of instant coffee jar of peanut butter key knife lightbulb long-necked glass soda bottle orange pen pepper shaker ping pong ball pint glass plastic bowling pin potato salad tones salt shaker screwdriver shot glass toothbrush toy car turnip wine cork zucchini uh-huh now that we've settled that who feels like sushi in February of 2012 the Journal of parapsychology published a report on a 63 year old Korean woman who experienced severe needle-like pain in her mouth while eating a dish of parboiled squid she immediately spat the squid out but it was too late upon examination by a doctor 12 squid spermatophores were found to have implanted themselves into the mucous membrane of the woman's tongue cheek and gingiva the parasites were promptly removed along with some of the woman's damaged oral tissues apparently internal organs including the sperm bag weren't removed from the squid before meal preparation a game played by some kids in India almost had deadly consequences for one of the players in 2012 12 year old Anil Barela of Madhya Pradesh was messing around with some friends at a local river the kids dared one another to swallow live fish Anil took on the challenge however instead of going down in Neal's esophagus the three-and-a-half inch fish slipped down his windpipe and entered his left lung and they began to have trouble breathing and was rushed to the local hospital the doctors measured the oxygen level and in those blood at 80% 18 points lower than in normal 98% an x-ray showed Anil's left lung as completely opaque due to the foreign object lodged in it doctors performed an emergency bronchoscope II and inserted a cable in tinel's lungs the camera showed that the fish was still alive doctors then performed a 45 a procedure to remove the fish anil made a full recovery planning on sticking dip vegetables now in another food-related mishap in the summer of 2010 75 year old retired schoolteacher ron spendin felt terrible he was chronically fatigued had lost his appetite and frequently had coughing spells a lifelong smoker ron had been battling abbas EEMA for some time but with the sudden turn in his health he worried that he had cancer when ron was rushed to the hospital with a collapsed lung his x-rays revealed something unusual there was a one and a half inch piece Prout growing in his lawn much like an ill doctors thought that while eating peas one simply went down the wrong pipe and lodged in Ron's lung instead of ending up in his stomach Ron was relieved to find out that he didn't have cancer and was also amazed he couldn't remember the last time he had eaten fresh peas either apparently when a pea germinates it simply needs a warm wet place to begin to sprout the pea shoot was removed from Ron's along by a thoracic surgeon as a joke the hospital staff served on peas as part of his first meal after the operation Ron took the joke in stride and ate them Ron's not the only person to have a plant to grow in their lungs in 2009 Russian doctors operated on 28 year old Artem Sid Yorkin expecting to remove a tumor and allegedly found a 2-inch fir seedling sprouting in his lung obviously the results of ingesting non-food items can be very dangerous 52 year old Margaret Dallman of the Netherlands showed up at the hospital complaining of a stomachache upon viewing x-rays of her stomach doctors were dumbfounded to see a large mass of silverware when going in for surgery Margaret explained to the doctors that often when she sat down to eat she couldn't help herself she would ignore the meal and feast on the cutlery instead Margaret had previously been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder which left her with an urge to eat non-food items the surgery removed 78 spoons and forks for Margaret's stomach however no knives were found Margaret was never interested in eating those and she couldn't explain why Margaret made a full recovery and underwent therapy for her predilection Margaret's not the only one to suffer the strange affliction though doctors have removed a variety of items that patients have ingested common non-food snacks are magnets coin and chalk in 2014 a teenage girl from kersek Stan's bad habit almost ended her life though her stomach was swollen 18 year old aperi Alex IVA kept losing weight and was dangerously dehydrated in malnourished she couldn't keep any food down even just drinking water brought about terrible pains doctor struggled to diagnose her at first and then figured out the culprit a massive hairball was blocking her digestive system a Perry had to be transported to a large hospital in the capital city of Bishkek for an emergency life-saving surgery to remove the nine pound hairball the hairball formed due to Perry's proclivity to chew on and eat her hair and bits and pieces of wolf she found on the carpet at home apparently during her surgery her stomach was so distended hair began to ooze out as soon as the wall of a Perry stomach was cut despite looking through 50 years of records the doctor said they were unable to find any cases that involved a hairball this large you heard correctly not other cases involving a hairball other cases involving a hairball this large sometimes after a vacation you end up feeling more stressed than if he had just stayed at work in the summer of 2007 Erin Dallas of Carbondale Colorado who visited the town of orange walk police to assist with the mountain bike race upon returning home he developed large painful bumps on his head vent bled and ooze his doctor thought they were fly bites that would eventually heal up but the bumps wouldn't heal Erin visited a specialist who thought he might have shingles a painful rash caused by the varicella zoster virus the same virus that causes chickenpox Erin tried several different creams and ointments but to no avail week's went by Erin started getting flashes of pain that would send him to his knees it felt like spikes were being driven into his skull then the lumps started throbbing and moving Erin thought he was going crazy he could even hear the lumps another visit to a doctor brought about the revelation that Erin's scalp was infested with botfly larvae medical staff gnome Darrin's head and extracted five fingernail-sized maggots most likely Erin was bitten by a mosquito carrying bought fly eggs mosquitoes stable flies and other insects are used by female botflies to disseminate their eggs to various hosts in this case the host was Erin Erin's not the only person who's brought home an unexpected souvenir after a vacation during the summer of 2013 the Franklin family of so Vallejo California went on a camping trip to Spooner's Cove beach on the central California coast four-year-old Paul fell and scraped his right knee on a rock his parents cleaned up the small cut and put a bandaid on it however the wound kept seeping and never seemed to scab over a week later Paul fell on the knee again while ice-skating further opening the wound his mother once again cleaned and redressed the cut over the next few weeks Paul's knee became swollen and infected he began to limp thinking he had a staph infection his parents took him to the doctor at first a 10-day course of antibiotics seemed to improve the infection but then it flared up again the cut began seeping pus and a small black lump grew under Paul's skin his mother worried that the wound was to becoming necrotic against doctors advice she squeezed the lump and an odd-looking tiny rock popped out of Paul's knee his mother took a closer look at the pebble noticing a swirl pattern she realized it was a tiny snail and it was alive the Franklin's figured that there were snail eggs on the rock Paul script his knee on Paul's parents let him keep the snail as a pet then he named it turbo after the cartoon snail we could go on and on about the various insects larvae tapeworms and spiders that have been discovered and removed from people ears and nose seem to be especially popular hiding places perhaps because of the easy access however will spare you and leave it to your imagination in 2015 Estela Melendez a 91 year old resident the la boca chile went to the hospital after a fall she had an x-ray and was told by doctors she had a tumor in her abdomen and needed surgery a second x-ray was ordered for confirmation and it revealed something shocking the mass was not a tumor but a fetus for the last 60 years as stella hell lump in her abdomen but didn't know that she was carrying a litho PDL or stone baby it's a rare phenomenon that occurs when a fetus dies during pregnancy and is too large to be reabsorbed by the mother as part of a foreign body reaction the fetus calcifies on the outside protecting the mother's body from dead tissue and preventing infection there have been about 300 cases of known with OPD on world wide with the calcified fetus being carried for an average of 22 years in several cases the mother was able to become pregnant again and gave birth to children without incident in the case of Estella the was only sometimes uncomfortable but not causing serious pain medical professionals decided not to proceed with surgery however sometimes doctors do remove a with opinion in 2009 92 year old huang jia jun from china had a 60 year-old fetus removed in 1948 when she was 31 she became pregnant only to find that she had a rare condition instead of implanting in the uterus as normal her pregnancy was ectopic with the egg implanting outside her fallopian tubes causing what's known as an abdominal pregnancy the fetus soon passed away and doctors told Wong Lee Joong to get it removed to avoid any potential future health problems unfortunately the surgery was expensive and Wong simply didn't have the money so she ignored her condition until she was able to have it removed some 60 years later our last story of something disturbing removed from a person's body is about an interesting and creepy medical phenomenon which is estimated to occur in one in five hundred thousand live births all his life Sanju Bhagat of Nagpur India had breathing problems and a protruding belly over time his stomach swelled even further making him look like he was nine months pregnant one night in June of 1999 his breathing problems got worse and an ambulance rushed the 36 year old farmer to the hospital doctors began to operate thinking that sends you had a large tumor pressing on his diaphragm as they cut into size you stomach unexpectedly gallons of liquid gushed out then the doctors found something unsettling Sanju had a twin in his stomach there was a half-formed fetus with hair bones and developed hands with long fingernails Sanju had one of the world's rarest and most bizarre medical conditions fetus in fetu it's an extremely rare development abnormality that occurs early in pregnancy when a fetus gets trapped inside its twin the parasitic twin leeches off the dominant twin as the fetuses continue to grow usually both fetuses die before birth from the strain of sharing a pulse enta however in some cases such as Sanju's the host twin survives and is born it is possible for the trapped fetus to survive past birth by forming an umbilical cord like structure that leaches it's twins blood supply fewer than 90 cases of fetus and fee to have been recorded in medical literature though sanjeev's case is even more unusual because no one suspected but God had a twin inside him for 36 years after surgery Sanju's ability to breathe improved and he made a full recovery as a kid sound you had been bullied and teased that he was pregnant ironically his tormentors were sort of right the date is March 1943 and in a prisoner of war camp inside occupied Poland Royal Canadian Air Force pilot William ash approaches the camp's toilet facilities a single POWs leads against low latrines doorways casually keeping watch on the rest of the kin the PFW nods at ash's he approaches and allows him to enter the small squat latrine inside our two rows of toilets built in the classic Roman style nine boxed in seats ring the sides of the room and consist of nothing more than concrete boxes with no dividers between them the wooden seats led down to a large concrete pit underneath where hundreds of prisoners relieve themselves into everyday a small hole leads to a huge sewage bit which is drained every week into the waiting truck of a local farmer who uses the camp's wastes to fertilize his fields as Ash enters the building he spots two men seated at the far seats who return his nod of greeting one of them stands and lifts the seat he was just sitting on revealing a hole in the concrete that's just barely large enough for a man to squeeze through the stench of human waste laughs up from below powerful enough to make the men's eyes tear up as they fight the urge to vomit yet powering through the horrid assault on their nostrils the men climbed down into the hole one by one as they land a few inches of waste water splashing urine and feces all over the men but they ignore it as they turn their attention to the task at hand the men remove a panel that's been made to look like a false wall and reveal a small chamber beyond which has been carved from the frozen soil itself using candles made of boot strings and margarine held in a ten dish the men joined three others who are already waiting there and stripped down to their underwear one man sits at a bellows made of bold leather kit bags and as he works at he pushes air through a pipe made of old cans into the tunnel which the crew has been digging for weeks now two now move down into that tunnel while the remainder stay behind to handle the soil that the diggers displace in their dig the entire crew is split up into shifts with some men taking turns digging while others men the bellows dispose of the dirt or stands watch above disposal of the dirt is accomplished by pushing the dirt through the sump directly onto the toilets above and into the huge sewage bit beyond once a week Polish farmer friends she SEC Levin Dow ski arrives at the camp and pumps the sewage out for use on his farm yet Levin Dow ski has begun to notice more and more dirt in the wastewater before he has a chance to complain to the Nazi guards though another prisoner Yosef Burke's our young Czechoslovakian informs levin dosti of the escape plan the Polish farmer is no fan of the Nazis especially after their invasion and occupation of his home and keeps the plan a secret doing his part to aid the would-be escapees by dutifully carting away the soil as the digging team finishes its work for the day the third team enters the tunnel and begins the job of shoring up the tunneled walls and sealing the tunneling work carried out with nothing more than cut out aluminum cans is dangerous work and the tunnel is under constant threat of collapse each day that the tunnel extends further and deeper the men requires just a little bit more courage to enter the dark tunnel not knowing if that's the day the tunnel will collapse and trap them with little or no hope of rescue it's the job of the third team then to enter and shore up the sides and ceiling as best they can using wooden boards taken from their barracks and even the bed frames themselves the boards make for a rudimentary shoring but help add a little bit of safety to the entire endeavor as they shore up the freshly dug lengths of tunnel the men also extend the air pipe which brings in oxygen to the tunneling crew they use powdered milk cans for the job cutting them so that they fit into n the air they pump is from the latrine itself and bedded with the stench of human waste but it brings life-saving oxygen as the men dig deeper and further into the earth to expedite the process of digging the men have developed an ingenious system to move freshly dug earth to the latrine sump for disposal two length of rope extends down the tunnel and at one end is an empty sack the diggers fill the sack with dirt and they give the Rope a sharp tug which cow the man at the halfway point to begin hauling on the rope to bring the dirt out of the tunnel once it reaches the midway point that man attaches it to the second rope whose end he has with him and then gives that rope a sharp tug the men at the entrance then drag the sack from the halfway point all the way to the entrance of the tunnel where the dirt is emptied into the latrine some the system is rudimentary and nowhere as near sophisticated as the homemade railroad tracks and trolleys that the minute the Stalag loop 2/3 prison complex would use to escape and serve as inspiration for the film The Great Escape yet the process saves countless hours of labor as it takes half an hour to squeeze down the 2 foot by 2 foot tunnel each day the early march of 1943 the team digging at the end of the tunnel began to dig directly upwards by their calculations they've dug several hundred feet past the perimeter fencing a task which requires them to not just dig out from their starting point but down into the rocky soil to a depth of over a dozen feet in order to avoid the seismic sensors that the Germans have installed to detect digging once well out of the fence the tunnel begins to angle upwards again and now the men are digging straight up one of them takes a long stick and pushes it into the ceiling above feeling resistance for two feet before the stick gives way to the top side the tunnel is finished and to avoid detection the last two feet of the tunnel will be dug up on the day of their escape now the men prepare for their breakout while the dig teams were working for weeks on the tunnel beer ski the young check has been helping secure fake papers for the escapees to do this he managed to talk his way into being part of a detail that's taken every week under guard to a produce store in town there the prisoner detail buys a few luxuries for the POWs such as chocolate cigarettes and the sorts they pay for this from the meager wages paid to them by the German government under its obligations to pay POWs for their labor via the Geneva Convention at the store a young Polish girl Stefania Malu 10 Scout works behind the counter and it isn't long before she's swooning at bears charms she's been helping to smuggle letters to bear his family members for months but now the escapees need her help in far more dangerous work Stefania has friends who work at town hall and she has them steal official German forms that will serve as a template for the forged identity papers needed by the escapees the identity papers will hide a the escapee says Polish citizens after their escape allowing them to bypass security checkpoints and hide their identities as POWs yet for the papers to look legitimate there's one more thing that's needed a photograph of each of the escapees to adorn their fake papers to get these photographs stephania takes the biggest risk of her life and helps secure a small camera and film from a polish laborer who used to be a teacher before the german invasion now he's forced to do hard labor and work rebuilding the same roads the Germans themselves bombed in the invasion and helping the prisoners escape will be his small measure of revenge against the Nazis the camera and the film is smuggled into camp via a 17 year old boy who routinely brings a shipment of the prisoners daily allowance of bread all hidden safely amongst the loafs after the prisoners take their photos the film is then smuggled out through the same young teenage boy who develops the photos himself in a makeshift photo lab inside his parents tiny apartment all of these brave Polish civilians assisting the escapees are taking huge risks and discovery of their involvement would certainly lead to a quick execution the date for the breakout is set to be March 5th as those amongst the prisoners with meteorological knowledge estimate that this will be the next moonless night in order to have the best chance of escape the men must move under the cover of deepest darkness and with no moon in the sky they stand a good chance of being unseen by the perimeter centuries the men decide that immediately after 5 p.m. roll call a group of them will head straight to the tunnel and wall themselves in until after lockup at 9:00 p.m. when the rest of the group will sneak out of their bunks and make their way to the tunnel a mathematician amongst them calculates that the tunnel will be able to support up to 33 men for 6 hours before the oxygen runs out and the men asphyxiate the figures and the math are both rough but it's the best the men have to go on at 5:00 p.m. on March 5th the guards line up the POWs and conduct their daily count satisfied that all men are accounted for they're left alone for recreation time 800 men moved to the recreation ground where a rugby match has been staged in order to help cover the escape attempt the men plotting their escape concealed clean clothes under their coats their pockets stuffed with a concoction term to the mixture a high-energy food made by the prisoners in each of their pockets are also their identification papers a map of the region and a homemade compass overhead gray clouds buildup and cold gusts of wind forced the German guards to seek what shelter they can inside their guard towers the men head to the latrine in pairs and once inside ditch their overcoats and make their way into the filth below as the night goes on the men are relieved to discover that the calculations for oxygen supply were correct and at last 9:00 p.m. rolls around along with the final group to enter the escape tunnel the men break through the last two feet of dirt at the end of the tunnel and crawl out into freedom grateful to leave the smelly stinking tunnel behind at last the men break up into groups and head in different directions so as not to draw attention to themselves posing as travelers unfortunately within the end of the week all 36 escapees would be recaptured by the Germans with many sent off to new prison camps though the escape ultimately failed it proved to be one of the most daring and smelliest escapes of World War two inspiring many heroic attempts by other Allied soldiers throughout the rest of the conflict if you caught our show on the Chernobyl nuclear disaster you'll know all about what happened on April 25th 1986 and how it shook the world what you might not know is that it could have been much much worse had it not been for the extremely brave people we're going to talk about today but first let's see what happened on that fateful day prior to that disaster there were around 14,000 people living in this ukrainian city of Chernobyl which is located around 90 kilometers northeast of the capital Kiev you can actually visit there today but it's somewhat a ghost town and the few residents that live there stay outside of the Chernobyl exclusion zone what happened back in the 80s was basically an explosion of one of the reactors at the nuclear plant it's at around 50 people died as a direct result of the explosion but the World Health Organization tells us that around 4,000 people died as an indirect result of the big bang we are further told that thousands of people were exposed to high levels of radiation but millions more were exposed to lower levels of radiation the extent of the damage is difficult to say but the who says some people who were exposed to this radiation have a higher risk of getting cancer in their lifetime how did it happen we'll answer that first and then get around to the question of what could have happened if it weren't for our exceptionally valiant trio of heroes sometimes call the Suicide Squad we could basically say human error but as with many disasters there have been what you might call a perfect storm of things that went wrong we'll summarize here as we've done a show on this already the world nuclear Association explains that workers at Chernobyl reactor four who are doing tests and to cut a long story short the power of the reactor plummeted and so workers tried to increase the power then there was a power surge and all hell was about to break loose there was a lot of steam and a huge amount of pressure was building up inside one of the reactors this eventually blew off the 1,000 ton lid on the reactor causing radiation to leak while air got into the reactor which caused a fire a very big fire a second explosion ensued when hydrogen was formed by hot water steam contacting zirconium this was even bigger than the first explosion now there was debris flying around fires breaking out dust so thick it was hard to see an electricity blackout in no working phone lines it was mayhem firefighters did arrive though but they weren't aware of all that dangerous radiation in the air even after they did manage to contain the place the workers as well as the residents of the town did not know what kind of danger they were it took hours to totally put that raging fire out but nothing could stop the spread of radiation that was now traveling far in life as we said some people still live in parts of town today but not in the areas that were hit most by the radiation you can even take a tour of the town that was and it is supposed to be a spooky experience as people just up and left leaving many of their things behind them it's now said that wild animals have come from the nearby forests and they're the new inhabitants of the town okay so what could have happened in the book to Chernobyl 12340 the incredible true story of the world's worst nuclear disaster we're told that under the reactor was a massive pool of water which was there to act as a coolant what the workers knew or some of them was that they couldn't allow all the hot radioactive metal to reach that pool of water the author of this book said in an interview if that happened it would have triggered a second steam explosion that would have done unimaginable damage and destroyed the entire Power Station including the three other reactors he goes as far as to say that such a blast could have denuded Europe of about half of its citizens and would have left part of the continent uninhabitable for many thousands of years due to radiation he is not alone either in saying that a former Soviet physicist called Vasily and Nesterenko said this our experts studied the possibility and concluded that the explosion would have had a force of three to five megatons Mint's which is 320 kilometers from Chernobyl would have been raised in Europe rendered uninhabitable this is where the Suicide Squad comes in these guys knew that they had to drain the pool but there was a problem in that the basement was flooded and they couldn't get to the valves to drain it one story goes that the three men on the c2 plant staff and one soldier decided to man up and Don wetsuits and swim through the water to give to these mouths it said they had a light but when their lab failed the work they were in total darkness they were told that this mission was likely a suicide mission because if they didn't drown they were probably going to dine from such a huge amount of radiation exposure yep it sounds like a Hollywood movie and we can imagine a tear-jerking crescendo as these brave guys swim in darkness and there are ample cuts to their distraught lives and wailing children but this meet Hollywood this is real life while there may have been cheers as those men managed to open the valves and drain the pool if there was an extended version of the film it would include three men then dying slowly in a hospital from acute radiation syndrome this is often abbreviated as ARS now the movie cuts to three guys vomiting all the time having seizures terrible headaches feeling dizzy perhaps experiencing a crisis of the skin and ultimately dying a really horrible death this we might say is not so much Hollywood but grim European realism it might actually work in Russian cinema but such a movie would be way too depressing to attract Hollywood Finance ears this was the story that circulated for a long time but the author of the book we just mentioned said he spent five years researching the disaster and found out that things were a little different the basement entry while dangerous wasn't quite as dramatic as modern myth would have you believe he said in an interview he said that firefighters had tried to drain the pool before these three guys all plant workers and no soldiers came to the scene he said many people tried to empty that pool and we don't know what happened to them he also said that it's true that the basement was flooded and it was hard to find the valves but he said the water was only waste time still radiation was everywhere and the men Alexian an echo Valeri vespa LOF and Boris bear we're at risk as they waited around he'd searched those valves it was like finding a needle in a haystack sat the writer adding that this place was a massive network of valves and pipes and finding the right one seemed impossible to those men but they found the right valves in the end when the searchlight beam fell on the pipe they were joyous one of the men later said in an interview with the Soviet media the pipe led to the valves he added and it was a job well done they then turned the valves and they'd heard the rush of water being emptied from the tank it said that there was about five million gallons of water which is well over 18 million liters then it did get a bit Hollywood we're told as when the men got back to the rest of the people waiting for them to finish their mission there was a lot of hooting and honks but what about the slow painful death from ARS well we're told that that didn't happen the way that sometimes been described it said one of those guys died some years later from a heart attack but the other survived the author of the book said he knew one of them was still working in the same industry and the other he knew was certainly alive up until 2015 at least he kind of lost the man after that year people did die of ARS after the disaster but not those three men according to him he said it is quite hard to get to the heart of the matter as after the event the Soviet Union tried to downplay the incident and all the most accurate information has still not been translated from Russia he did say though that these three guys likely prevented a bigger disaster happening that could have killed millions of people in an interview he said they still went into a pitch-black badly damaged basement beneath the molten reactor core that was slowly burning its way down to them we might also say that many people risk their lives during this disaster and during the long cleanup afterwards these folks are sometimes called the liquidators and they number into thousands according to something called the Chernobyl union 25,000 of the Russian Liquidators are dead and 70,000 disabled about the same in Ukraine and 10,000 dead in Belarus and 25,000 disabled we might add though that the number of people said to have gotten sick or died because of exposure to large amounts of radiation is a very controversial topic and many reports different studies have also shown that the millions of people exposed to smaller amounts of radiation should not be at a higher risk of cancer except perhaps thyroid cancer we can say with assurance though that a lot of brave people put their lives at risk in an interview one of the liquidators said he knew the risks but he just had to do his job I'm worried for the future he said I get my blood checked twice a month I go through the scanners four times a day but the pay is good and someone has to do this we're told that the area's most exposed to large amounts of radiation won't be safe to live for 20,000 years there are many horrific devices of the distant past that were intended to inflict unbearable pain or flat-out kill their target some of these such as the brazen bull a brass statue in which the victim would be burned alive sound pretty terrifying the breast Ripper or pair of anguish are other examples of things that you just know you wouldn't want to have happen but say you were captive and those in charge threatened to bring out the wheel the Catherine Wheel you might think well that doesn't actually sound so bad you'd be in for quite a shock we'll explain why in this episode of the infographics show the Catherine Wheel worst punishments according to legends the Catherine Wheel is named after Saint Catherine of Alexandria who is a patron to those academically or philosophically inclined and prevents unexpected death now there's no mention of this individual before the ninth century although she supposedly lived in the fourth so it's suspected that she did not truly exist nevertheless her story was a well-known one that began in Egypt she was believed to be Noble if not a princess as well as very studious however some might consider it less than wise that she rose up to protest the wrongs of the then Roman Emperor of the time Maxentius who was relentlessly persecuting Christians Maxentius allegedly selected several scholars to engage in a battle of wits with the young Catherine but ultimately the wise men lost as a further insult while she was imprisoned for her words Catherine managed to convert many of Maxentius soldiers and even his wife to the Christian religion needless to say that didn't exactly sit well with Maxentius after torture in which she declared Jesus Christ her spouse she was sentenced to death this is when the wheel came into play which was the intended execution airy device the story goes that it shattered at her touch and so in desperation the Emperor ultimately had her beheaded she was then carried to Mount Sinai interestingly later on Saint Joan of Arc identified Catherine's voice as one of the several she heard so what is this wheel that Catherine had miraculously escaped but that went on to kill many of the less fortunate another name it's known by the breaking wheel will probably give you some ideas it was a wheel made of wood similar if not the same as those used on carriages in addition to being made of hefty wood these wheels were outfitted with a metal rim though sometimes they would be modified so that they could inflict further damage with protruding iron blades these massive wheels would then be dropped on convicts all over their body breaking bones upon impact another approach was to tie a person to the wheel and hit his or her limbs with iron hammers or bars while the wheel was rotated as long as the bones were shattered that was all that mattered the exact amount of wheel drops or hammer hits were already determined beforehand this would depend on the extent of the convicts crimes such as if they committed acts of robbery or murder for the worst offenders efforts were made to better match their punishment to the crimes for example sharp pieces of wood would sometimes be set underneath the victim to bring yet further torture on the other hand for those they wanted to spare the worst they could deliver a fatal blow during the wheel dropping or iron hitting process or right after it was over unfortunately most were not so lucky in the bone breaking was only the beginning or step one of two or three following step one bodies were typically threaded through the spokes of another wheel while this would be difficult to do with a normal person it was much easier once their limbs were broken the wheel was then attached to a pole and displayed for all the see much like those who had undergone crucifixion at this point some would be cut apart or strangled which would finally though painfully in their suffering others would be placed above a blazing fire or alternatively thrown directly in one it was even possible for the individual to be hung while on the wheel though this option was generally reserved for those who had been found guilty of either the very worst crimes or multiple serious offenses the executioner's in charge had no mercy even upon the souls of those thiet killed bodies were simply left where they had been thrown or hung up to be eaten away by the beaks teeth and claws of wild animals many believed that this would prevent the souls from ever finding eternal peace it would also serve as a gruesome warning to others but there was one little hope for those sentenced to death by the Catherine Wheel and that was if they somehow became disengaged or if the wheel in some way failed to do its job in these circumstances it was seen as divine intervention and the conflicts life would ultimately be spared however this was highly unlikely it happened so rarely that it did it would become the subject of religious paintings depicting the miracle more often than not those given the sentence never made it into the works of art further their suffering could drag on seemingly endlessly before they died there are stories of a murderer in the 14th century who held on for three days before he expired another time a man by the name of Bonadies lasted for four full days and nights a more questionable account of a German serial killer in the 1500s claims that he remained alive with the help of alcohol for as many as nine days but again more likely than not this last account is just another legend the Catherine or breaking wheel was quite a horrible device it was used as a method of public execution in Europe from antiquity to early modern times Bavaria utilized it until it was outlawed in 1813 and it's suspected last use was in Prussia as late as 1841 we are all too thankful as our modern-day criminals that over time it lost favour with most societies September 20th 2019 the day that the people of Earth discovered that the US government has been hiding the presence of extraterrestrials from the public our millennia of intergalactic solitude has finally come to an end and the greatest question ever asked by science has at last been answered are we alone for decades the people of Earth have been visited by aliens from another planet who have worked in secret cooperation with the United States government these aliens have crossed the vast distances of intergalactic space with mind-bending technologies in order to mutilate cows show up as blurry blobs and videos and conduct experiments on abductees involving probes in very uncomfortable places the truth is no longer out there it's finally here or in the open or perhaps September 20th 2019 will merely be the day that many hundreds of mislead people get arrested for trespassing by the US government earning hefty fines long sentences in a federal prison and ending up with experiments involving probes in very uncomfortable places of a totally different sort today we're going to look at the phenomenon that has swept the Internet the massive plan to raid area 51 and plunder it of its alien seek and turn to a friend of the show and former security expert for the US military as he tells us why storming area 51 is a terrible idea On June 27th a Facebook event hosted by three different Facebook accounts appeared publicly entitled simply storm area 51 they can't stop all of us the event would later be claimed by a Maddy Roberts as having been started in jest but the joke very quickly caught on and went global as of this writing 1.7 million people have signed on to the event and another 1.3 million are interested the official date is set for September 20th 2019 for the hours between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m. while Roberts has come forward and explained that it was a joke he did so only after the event skyrocketed in popularity and out of fear that should something really happen that the US government would be looking for him for being the ringleader he wanted to publicly declare that the event was a joke and he was in no way serious about storming area 51 whether he was serious or not is likely not to matter come September 20th with the event gaining popularity around the world while most people signed on to the event as a satirical joke it's clear from the Facebook page for the event that there are plenty of people who see the opportunity to rush the secretive restricted area in mass as a way to at last plunder its secrets the rallying cry of they can't stop us all has made many people take the event seriously and it's now feared that on September 20th a large group of people will make a serious attempts to enter the secretive base recently the US Air Force sent out a message addressing the online joke warning that any attempts to illegally access the area is highly discouraged so could enough people breach the secret bases defenses what would happen if they did and while the hoopla over area 51 anyways area 51 is situated in a remote corner of the Nevada test and training range at Groom Lake which is a large expansive desert where US pilots hone their abilities dropping live and dummy ordnance on ground targets it was so remote in fact that it quickly became the premier destination for developing new and advanced planes for the CIA and the US Air Force it was for instance where the infamous u-2 spy plane was originally developed a technological marvel it's time which flew so high that it was four years out of reach of Soviet fighters and missiles the facility was also the home of the infamous skunk works a group of engineers who developed some of the world's most advanced airplanes and from which the likes of the sr-71 and the f-117 came from any other information to include if the legendary skunk work still operates from the site is difficult to verify as the entire facility remains a highly classified secret and the US government barely even acknowledges its presence satellite imagery of the site though shows that indeed several buildings and flight lines have been constructed and curiously enough a flight line long enough to land even the biggest aircraft developed anywhere in the world is clearly visible others claim that you can see in some satellite images how the flight lines lead to underground bunkers though the veracity of those claims is dubious at best if alien life was visiting planet Earth and the United States government had in fact on its hands on some of that alien tech or was cooperating with aliens it seems that area 51 would be the ideal place for such activity the site is notoriously remote and difficult to get to miles away from any road and difficult to spy on due to the mountains that bordering but could you penetrate it and if you did what would happen our expert warns us immediately that any attempts to penetrate a restricted military facility comes with serious consequences this isn't stranger things this is real life and trying to get into a restricted area can land you with serious jail time huge fines or worse trespassing on a restricted military facility can carry a penalty of up to 10 years in federal prison and is often accompanied by a fine of tens of thousands of dollars which you will be obligated to pay before or after your prison sentence naturally though the condition of your trespass is often taken into consideration with our expert telling us that if it's clear you were inadvertently trespassing then you would likely simply be apprehended searched debriefed and then driven back to a point outside of the facility and be free to go if however your trespass was purposeful you might get the book thrown at you specifically if it seemed like your trespass was malicious in nature as in you were actively trying to steal government materials or secrets different restricted areas have different levels of secrecy however and some places termed world facilities are so secretive that your trespass and ensuing trial are all kept under the strictest of measures of secrecy with no details of your trial becoming public knowledge no you're not tried by some secret of shadow court and condemned to the Dark Side of the Moon but rather your trial and everyone involved including your lawyer and any witnesses are all forced to sign extremely harsh confidentiality agreements with very very strict penalties for breaking them that is of course if you are arrested because our expert tells us that there is one more option for dealing with trespassers and that's to simply shoot them no this isn't Soviet Russia where you can get shot for just hopping a fence to a military base but our expert warns us that there are concentric rings of security around restricted facilities and if you penetrate deep enough through those rings of security you eventually hit one ring where deadly force is authorized no questions asked of course these areas are always very clearly marked by signs which state as much so there's no chance you would wander into an area where you could just get shot for being there with no authorization you would have to make the choice to continue pushing forward despite the risks the reason why these harsh measures exist is simple some secrets are so vital to national security that the government cannot risk their being discovered by foreign governments take for instance the Manhattan Project if knowledge of how to build a working nuclear weapon was discovered by the Germans the entire course of the war may have taken a radically different route if you managed to penetrate the outer layers of security and get to those shoot first ask questions later areas then it means that you are there on a mission and you're likely seeking to cause great harm to the US so what would happen if you joined 1.7 million people in rushing area51 would you get to see dem aliens first our expert tells us that you would run into a sign warning you that you're entering into a restricted area and typically warning you of the penalties for doing so most secretive government facilities aren't behind huge fences as that would be far too obvious a giveaway but rather they rely on extreme remoteness and large tracts of empty lands to discourage anyone getting too close throughout this seemingly empty landscape our security patrols dispersed throughout the first two outer rings of security and even if you don't see them odds are that they armed with high-powered visual aids night vision and thermal imagers these security personnel are vectored in on trespassers by sensors hidden under the ground pressure sensors buried under avenues of approach and seismic sensors throughout the entire outer perimeter give alarm operators perfect situational awareness of the miles of empty landscape surrounding the secret facility and typically a host of hidden high-power cameras allow them to spy on any portion of their perimeter if trespassers are detected they're typically allowed to wander through the first outer perimeter of security without being intercepted that's because these areas are so large and remote that people wander in and out by accident all the time and the security personnel at the facility prefer that you never even find out you had inadvertently strolled into some where he weren't supposed to the entire time you're in the first ring of security though you will be closely monitored from afar sometimes even by air through drones and likely not have a clue that you're being spied on if however you continue forward you will reach the second outer ring of security much smaller than the first outer ring the second ring is continuously patrolled by security personnel on foot or in vehicles and penetrating it will result in a security patrol being immediately dispatched to apprehend you our expert tells us that you likely won't get too far through this second ring of security as you'll have been carefully observed the entire time you approached it through the first ring a patrol will move to your position and apprehend you search you and your vehicles and typically debrief you or just move you straight back to the outermost perimeter and warn you not to return should you somehow evade detection or capture though you'll reach the inner ring of security or at least the inner ring of the outer security zone because there remains one more inner ring that's within the facility buildings itself hear movement of personnel is highly restricted even amongst the personnel who work at the facility and even though you may have the clearance to work at one part of the facility you may not have been cleared for any other part of the same facility in this inner ring though even the base staff have to be on high alert against straying where they don't belong for you a complete outsider who doesn't belong at all straying into this area could be deadly it's here that signs warning the use of deadly force are placed and while it can be up to discretion of the security commander or even the individual patrol that discovers you you really don't want to press your luck remember only really bad guys would be interested in getting this close to a secret facility so any responding security personnel are going to assume that you're out to cause some serious harm to the US we cannot stress enough how dangerous it would be to penetrate this area these are all of course the outer layers of security and inside each facility our expert tells us that even more stringent security measures exist with even greater repercussions for violating them he would not elaborate on inner security measures but did tell us that many times the guards restricting access to the facility might themselves not have a high enough clearance to be inside the facility itself that's how seriously classified some facilities are and an entirely different team of guards with an even higher security clearance may be assigned to work the actual insides of the facility though our expert would not comment much on the inner workings of restricted facilities he did leave us with this story I was assigned to a facility with two outer doors each with a more stringent set of security measures to verify your identity before you could pass the outer door was open to the outside world and the second door where I was located was inside a small room connected to that first outer door there was a scanner machine that worked automatically and my job was to fold and sure nobody trying to access the facility messed with the machine as it verified their identity and credentials and if the machine ever sent off an alarm I was to immediately terminate the individual attempting entry once the Machine granted entry I was not allowed to look inside the open door and had to stand with my back to whatever the door opened up into after speaking with our expert it's clear that storming area 51 would be a terrible idea while group posts claim that they can't stop all of us our expert warns that yes they very much have the means and firepower to stop even a major incursion event and that if whatever is inside area 51 is a vital national security importance then they will do just that he warns us that the most sensitive of these facilities were designed to stop a full-scale military assault also though he would not go into specifics our expert told us that in all likelihood even if you managed to defeat the outer security you would simply be never able to access the actual themselves as part of their security measures include the ability to completely lock out the outside world we talked about what happens when you die a show that proved to be very popular we think it's only right we now talk about how you came into this world we don't know exactly how they came up with this number but some scientists say that the odds of you being born were one in four hundred quadrillion yeah you are special and don't you ever forget that first there were the odds of your father hooking up with your mother and one scientist told Business Insider that those odds were 1 in 20,000 then you have the odds of them staying together getting past the first date then the second and staying with each other until they decided to have you we're told to get to this point the odds are around 1 in 40 million now come the big odds because your mom will be born with one to two million eggs 500 of which will be ovulated and your dad will make around 500 billion sperm basically the fact that one sperm met one egg and made you is pretty amazing we also have to remember that for your parents to exist their ancestors had to to going back to the beginning of the human race you being born was nothing short of a miracle so we know that for you to exist many things had to happen but let's just talk about the day or night that you started off we're sure you had enough education to know that for you to exist your mother and father had to make love not many people like thinking about this but that's just what happened you probably also know that each time people make love without any type of contraception it doesn't mean guaranteed pregnancy there are many factors including the age of the people as well as when they may love and the people's reproductive systems some people have to try very hard to make a kid while other couples can't seem to miss one doctor from the Women's College Hospital in st. Joseph's Health Center in Toronto said that if the woman is under 35 she has an 85% of conceiving in one year when making love in each menstrual cycle the average cycle lasts 28 days the woman will Ave after her period the ovulation part starts about 14 days on average after the first day of her last period in many cases this part will happen about two weeks before the woman has her next period the woman will make an egg which is released by the ovaries and it's passed down the fallopian tubes where it can meet a sperm this lucky sperm can then fertilize the egg voila the process of making a baby is on the way to make a baby you don't need to wait for the ovulation period and you might not know that a man's sperm can wait outside a woman for this egg to be made it said sperm can live in a woman about five days although most don't survive that long okay so we know that a woman needs to produce an egg and a sperm that has to reach that egg and fertilize it but did you know that a man will create around 525 billion sperm cells in a lifetime something which led the now-deceased comedian Bill Hicks to say he has wasted entire civilizations from releasing sperm when not making love life science tells us that just one single shot can carry up to 40 million to 1.2 billion sperm cells why on earth do we need so many of these things scientists tell us that the reason is basically because of competition the more sperm the better chance one will get to the egg the highest sperm producers have the better chance of passing on their genes the distance the sperm has to travel to meet the magic egg is only 15 centimeters but this is no easy swim some of them just float back after takeoff while others are killed by acidic fluids inside the woman these are basically non starters but of the many millions that are launched about two million make it to base one the cervix here some just run into walls and die while others get trapped in mucus it's quite the race for those sperm and always fraught with danger however about 1 million will make it to base to the uterus unfortunately many come undone here and get taken out by white blood cells about 10,000 are now left and have made it all the way to the top of the uterus they then head to the oviduct and women have two of those but rarely make eggs in each that means that about half of those dear sperm choose the wrong door and there's nothing behind it the ones that went the right way will have to face the utero tubal Junction a place where the oviduct in the uterus is connected this busy Junction is tricky for the sperm to get through and many get stuck in mucus from millions we now have about 1,000 survivors heading to where the star prize is kept down the fallopian tubes many don't make it all the way to the egg it just died a sad thing when you think about how far they've made it but it gets because there can only be one in the words of highlight something happens called a cortical reaction which is basically the woman's egg blocking out multiple sperms sometimes there is a winner and that tough sperm that one one of the hardest races in the world is a part of you it's by no means a done deal though as there's a chance of miscarriage this often happens early and if a woman gets fast a 14 week mark she only has a 1% chance of losing the baby so now we are in business you're on your way to being born there are stages of pregnancy and we call these stages trimesters the entire pregnancy should last on average about 40 weeks but as you know some babies come out early from the first week until the twelfth week we call the first trimester during this time the woman will likely notice a few changes such as possibly having mood swings parts of her feeling swollen feeling nauseous having food cravings or getting a headache or heartburn but what's happening on the inside for the first couple of weeks there isn't much of a you yet about one week after the sperm won that race and met the egg the fertilized ovum attaches itself to the uterus lining and now the placenta starts to form at about two weeks the embryo looks a bit like a disc on this wall but it's not until about four weeks that this little embryo starts sprouting things the heart starts to form and little buds develop where the legs and arms will be here all of this is only about 125th of an inch the ears eyes nose all start to develop as do the spine and the digestive tract at about eight weeks we have something a little bit more human looking what we'll call the fetus the heart is now properly functioning and the fetus has all the organs but not fully formed that the baby to be will have nascent bones are now also starting to form at 12 weeks we are starting to see a tiny human replete with larger head genitalia tooth buds and even fingernails and toenails the baby can now move around to in what's called amniotic fluid this is the end of the first trimester at the beginning of the second trimester if the baby will be about 3 inches long and will weigh around an ounce the head will stop growing so fast and the eyelids will close as the eyes develop nerves and muscles come into action now in this fetus can even make a fist as the fetus is now bigger many women will now have a noticeable bump they may also start to feel a bit better and stop having those awful feelings of nausea saying that they might also have a lot of new aches and pains under the hood at 16 weeks the baby's skeleton keeps developing the skin looks white almost see-through the fetus at this point may have a bowel movement but it will be something called meconium it's a dark green substance that's pretty much poop the fetus is now about four or five inches long and weighs around three ounces at 20 weeks the little bundle of joy might seem to get restless and that's when the woman might start feeling the baby kicking many body parts are now fully formed such as fingernails and toenails we're told it can even start scratching itself at this point it can also swallow adhere things moving on to week 24 during the second trimester the baby makes its own blood cells from bone marrow it now has fingerprints it can taste things as taste buds form on the tongue and it will even get a bit of hair the lungs are not properly developed yet but that process is on the way whether a boy or a girl the fetus will now start developing its own reproductive organs another thing that starts now is a normal sleep cycle at this point it's about 12 inches long and might weigh in the region of one and a half pounds welcome to the third trimester the point in time when the woman is carrying around a lot of extra weight there will be discomfort at times and that's just the body reacting to having another thing grow inside of it at 32 weeks we almost have the finished package the baby's bones are not fully developed but they're getting there it can now open and close its eyes its lungs are still not fully formed but the baby at this point will be practicing breathing at this point the baby is also storing all the natural minerals its body needs to be healthy right now it might be as long as 16 inches and may weigh about four pounds or more at 36 weeks something called the bear necks thickens around the baby this is a waxy coating that protects the baby it's now storing a fair bit of body fat and that means less space to move around the woman will feel fewer of those kicks we usually have a fetus now at around 18 inches long and weighing around six pounds after this we have the real deal meaning the fetus has organs that are fully developed for the world outside as the time draws nearer to birth the baby may switch into a head first position it's just a matter of time now until it comes out it takes its first frets in the world when it does it may weigh about six to nine pounds but that can change the length might be around 20 inches but that can change too then what happens well in those first moments after it comes out the people around may clean the baby and a value a to tell its nose and throat will be very gently cleared the umbilical cord will be clamped in two places and then it'll be cut and in case you didn't know this Court connects the baby to the woman's womb it takes oxygen and nutrients to the baby from the placenta anyway after it's caught it will leave a stump this will turn dry and just drop off after around seven days or more the bellybutton should be fully healed what else happens right after birth well the baby will likely have antibiotic ointment rubbed on its eyes to stop infection it'll also receive an injection of vitamin K to help its blood clot as we said doctors will check if the baby's health is good but another important thing is to make sure its temperature is right if all is good after a few hours it may get a sponge back it will then likely get a little cap to where to keep its little head warm and in time will get its first taste of mother's milk baby and mother can usually go home after 24 to 48 hours but more tests might need to be done you might also have to visit the hospital again just for a check-up after a week or so and that's that this is how you were born or close to it we've all been there and we are all lucky in some ways to be alive an indomitable sperm met with an almighty egg after your mother and father had performed nature's life-giving dance how cool is that picture this you're 22 years old in the prime of your life with a pregnant and devoted wife you haven't been married to for very long and then everything changes one night when a man is murdered in the street you are accused of the murder with the evidence being that it was your face a witness saw running from the scene of the crime that evidence is weak to say the least and seeing as you know very well you didn't do it you're confident you'll get off but that's not the case and you will spend many years behind bars a trial judge will say you're likely innocent some 20 years after the crime was emitted and you still won't get out how could this happen let's start from the beginning the man we're talking about his name - Benjamin Spencer and he was convicted along with another man of committing a murder on a quiet street in West Dallas over 30 years ago on March 22nd in the year of 1987 a 33 year old named Jeffrey Young who was doing well for himself at a clothing company was attacked after walking out of his company office around 9:30 p.m. the police report says he was then manhandled into his BMW by two men and drove over to West Dallas and it's there his body was dumped down a dark alley police thought they had gotten lucky when witnesses came forward and said that they saw what happened there were three of those witnesses and they identified two men one was Spencer and the other was named Robert Mitchell but as the District Attorney of Dallas now says something might have been a miss because all the witnesses all knew Spencer these people were not strangers Spencer was by no means an angel he'd spent some time behind bars before for driving on a suspended license and had also been put on probation for six years for driving a car that had been stolen by a friend nonetheless as we said his new wife was pregnant and he was turning over a new leaf after he was picked up four days after the crime he wasn't very worried it was just a mistake a case of mistaken identity but that wasn't the case at all Spencer had an alibi - which was the testimony of a young woman friend of his who said she'd been hanging out with them when the murder and robbery took place on top of that there was no physical evidence linking Spencer to the crime just those witness testimonies during the robbery a watch had been stolen as well as a wedding ring a small portable TV and a briefcase none of these things were found at Spencer's house police didn't have any fingerprint evidence nor was there a murder weapon found many years later Spencer would say in an interview I began to think well I didn't commit this offense the truth is going to come out but a few months down the line Spencer was sentenced to 35 years in prison with the evidence being the witness's testimony as well as a jailhouse informants testimony it was a nightmare come true Spencer's heart sank his life was ruined the father-to-be had become a condemned man and the state had failed to do its job in his eyes but not long into his sentence Spencer got a break it turned out that the star witness in his case had lied she not told the truth about whether she had received the reward for coming forward and giving evidence a new trial was set but Spencer was then offered a plea deal by the state he could probably get out in five years if he accepted this but wasn't this five years too much and why would an innocent man taint his name by admitting he killed someone when he had it in his mind he'd been wronged and accepting a plea deal was just another wrong in the topsy-turvy world of American justice nonetheless his attorney told him to take it years later Spencer would tell NPR he was saying if you take it to trial they're going to give you a life sentence and they're likely to get it and I'm like I'm not going to plead guilty to something I didn't do who in their right mind would and so he didn't accept the deal during his second trial the state's prosecuted Spencer for aggravated robbery and asked for a life sentence the evidence again was a witness testimony with the star witness being a 42 year old woman who lived close to the alley where the victim was dumped it was her testimony that got Spencer convicted again and as you'll soon find out her testimony was hardly concrete but she stood her ground and according to reports was very convincing when she described what she had seen on the night of the crime this was Spencer and Mitchell dumping the body Mitchell was also convicted again and unfortunately he would not live much longer anyway so now Spencer is back in prison again looking down a long road of 30-something years living life behind bars as an innocent man his life now would be dedicated to proving his innocence and this would be a long process Spencer got in touch with organizations that helped wrongly convicted men who were serving time one such organization was named Centurion ministries and the people there knew that the state had sent down an innocent man they built a case interviewed over a hundred people and then asked for a hearing the petition ended up on the desk of a criminal court judge in Dallas named Ric Magnus he said he wasn't sure at first whether to have a hearing mostly because the exoneration wasn't based on any kind of new DNA evidence this is often what gets innocent people free but he later said in interviews that the more he read about the case he realized there had been a lot of wrongs in Spencer's conviction 20 years after the crime Magnus granted an evidentiary hearing the witnesses came forward again and this time two of them backed down but that woman who lived across from the alley didn't she stood firm again she said she had definitely seen Spencer as we said there was a big problem with her testimony that's because all those years later a forensic visual scientist was asked to watch a reenactment of the body being dumped what that was was people in the dark pretending to be the pair that dumped the body after this there was no doubt that this woman could have seen anything other than a silhouette no way she could have clearly seen a face as she said she had done that forensic scientists said with the conditions as they were a person could not have made out a face any farther than 25 feet away but as it stood the witness claiming to have seen the man who was standing closest to the crime scene was ninety three feet away again just no way could any of those witnesses have gotten a clear ID with this new evidence judge Magnus said okay enough is enough and he ordered a retrial on the grounds of something called actual innocence as for Spencer he said he was over the moon when he heard the news not only would he get out but he would clear his name - in an interview he said I was very hopeful I thought that this is it I'm going home that didn't happen though Spencer said that first he was hopeful that his retrial would take place within a few weeks they passed so then he thought maybe a few months and they passed in fact years past in the only Authority capable of granting a new trial the Court of Criminal Appeals it seems did nothing at all then in 2011 Spencer got some bad news there would be no retrial while a judge said that indeed if the new evidence had been presented at the first trial it would have been unlikely that Spencer would have been convicted but that same judge said because Spencer hadn't come up with any incontrovertible new evidence proving he wasn't there that night such as CCTV footage or DNA that had never been tested there would be no trial the judge admitted that Spencer was likely innocent but it didn't matter he didn't have the evidence to get that new trial his attorney now says that she needs to start again she needs to find this new evidence proving her clients innocence the problem of course is how do you find new evidence 28 years after the fact the woman across from the alley now won't talk openly about the case another witness died and another now says that she didn't get a clear look at Spencer the witness now says he felt pressured by the police to say it was Spencer so that's it the only thing saying Spencer is guilty is the testimony witness who it's been proven couldn't have possibly seen Spencer that night everyone seems to know the case stinks but the fact is the justice system doesn't seem to provide any solutions to get Spencer out but there's more there was another witness but this witness was never called she now says that she is 1000% sure that the people she saw didn't include Spencer what about that jailhouse informant well he now says that Spencer never told him he had committed the crime records also show something very fishy the informant said in court that he had not received any benefit from giving that statement but this guy was looking at a 25 year sentence for aggravated robbery guess what happened after he spoke to the police and gave his testimony he walked out of prison after just more than a year another person has come forward saying he knows who killed the men that night because it was a friend of his who did it he admitted it to him this man did not come forward at the time because he didn't want a rat on one of his friends the man whose name was put forward is currently serving time for robbery and assault investigators now say that police weren't going after Spencer but they just had a case of what's called tunnel vision they had a theory and they looked only at the evidence that fit that theory anything else was ignored Spencer now sits in his cell a man in his 50s wearing glasses waiting and hoping but he doesn't have too much hope left in an interview he said I'm just at a point where I'm still hopeful but at the same time it's like I'm stuck in a system his story has been written about extensively in the American media but it seems this man really is stuck in the system he's been denied parole on each occasion he was up for it and from what we can see still waits in his cell to this day waiting in vain for something to help him get him out of the web of American justice as we've said in previous shows not everyone using the dark web is doing something criminal in some ways this corner of the internet gets a bad name and research has shown many of the darkest things supposedly happening in the dark web have been exaggerated that said it's well known that many people mainly the younger generation go there to buy illegal substances that they may have otherwise procured on the street it's also well known that people with strange inclinations visit this place to chat with others that share their fascination with what we might call the more eccentric aspects of life you've seen our shows on the dark web you'll know that finding it is not that hard at all the question is should you go there that's what we'll discuss in this episode of the infographic show why you should avoid the dark web let's just give you a quick recap on the dark web as you may not have seen all our other shows on this place it said that only around 10% of the Internet is the Internet as we know it meaning the part we can all access much of the rest of the Internet we call the Deep Web which is just the part of the worldwide web that's not indexed by search engines such as Google it's a common mistake to think the dark web in the Deep Web are the same the dark web is just a small part of the Deep Web many people give it the example of an iceberg the bit at the top that we can see is the Internet as we know it the main part that lies under the water is the Deep Web and the dark web is just a very small part around the very bottom of the iceberg this is naturally where people go when they don't want to be found that might be because they have a store they are selling the aforementioned illegal substances or it might just be because they're living in a country that is very oppressive laws on speech in the dark web you'll find sites that end with dot onion these websites are not accessible using your regular browser but you can easily download the tor browser and before you could say where am I you'll be in the dark web here you should have complete anonymity okay so the question is should you go there well firstly you should know that the dark web of course is of interest to authorities illegal things happen there so we can expect authorities to keep an eye on the place you should also known that the tor browser has vulnerabilities with this in mind you might ask just how safe is your anonymity we might also ask if there are other reasons why you should not visit the dark web reasons more related to you finding things that you probably shouldn't have found with the latter concern in mind we looked at reddit and Cora posts containing people talking about negative experiences on the dark web we can't vouch for the honesty of these posts but indeed there are people out there who said they came across things in the dark web they wish they would have never seen one person on Quora wrote eyebrows dark web for well over half a year before a horrible experience made me quit that experience sounded very nasty and it's not something we want to recount here let's just say it involved a video of someone being hurt now others say this kind of thing is very unusual even for the dark web but we must remember that it does happen because an Australian man was put in prison for making such videos unless you're sick to the bone this is not the kind of thing one wants to see in life so we could say that one reason not to go to the dark web might be because out of curiosity you see something you might not ever be able to forget another person who used the dark web said he looked at forums where he found what he called weird stuff by that he meant people talking about hurting others discussing gore and talking about depraved things such as wanting to eat people and yet another person said he witnessed what he called a very creepy video he said there were about 50 people watching this video again relating to someone being hurt in this case not very hurt but still not something people would want to see and many of the folks watching this video were making what he called obscene comments another person on the same thread said he was just hitting random links when he came across a cooking section only the cooking involved humans this wasn't a video but a how-to kind of section I was traumatized for a few days he said because he just read the comments so unless you want to be traumatized we suggest you might get the dark web a wide berth we are quite sure you have to go looking for this kind of stuff however so perhaps if you have to go there just be careful what you search for has one website that gives advice on the dark web tells us it's easy to click suspicious links or partake in criminal activity that website says some of these links are deceptive and before you know it you're virtually living in the realms of the demented we looked at another website called dark web news.com it told us that many people access the dark web without using the tor browser it said this can be done with websites such as tor - web and onion - web the problem here is that you are exposed and this puts you at risk of being hacked other than that many people do use the tor browser but they don't use a VPN the problem here is that the tour has been cracked a few times and if that happens your URL can be seen okay so you only went to that disgusting site out of sheer curiosity but still you went there and it might not look good for you when your local newspaper has a headline that goes something along the lines of boys 17 caught downloading images of xxx X on the dark web we're also told that you should not Abell scripts on onion sites which is what many people do when you do this we're told you can leave yourself open to hacking or you just might find a Trojan horse has gotten into your computer you might also accidentally download files from the dark web and this is a big no-no still people might just do this by accident but the big thing to remember according to that same expert is don't think that what you're doing on the dark web is illegal the person says if you're viewing a site on the dark web for any reason from actually desiring to acquire these products or services or just to wanting to quench your thirst for knowledge on the subject know that you may be held liable for what you come across with that in mind have people been arrested for using the dark web well in 2018 the US media reported that authorities had made a huge bust of people selling illegal things in the dark web Engadget tells us that these authorities announced the first ever national level undercover bust of dark web outfit selling drugs weapons and other contraband now perhaps you'd visited some of those sites that got taken down again it was just out of curiosity but if they could find the owners of the sites what's to bet that you could have been exposed it's just not something you want to happen to you and it might not matter that you went to those sites innocently other websites tell us that the FBI and police from all over the world are regularly inside the dark web sometimes they go undercover and manage to find the address where parcels are delivered the Indian media tells us that arrests were made in 2017 by the Mumbai anti-narcotics cell when some boys had ordered LSD from the dark web arrests have also been made of the sellers in one such case in the UK a bunch of students at Manchester University were arrested after making a fortune on the dark web selling illegal substances The Guardian wrote three gang who compared themselves to the breaking bad character Walter White included undergraduate studying pharmacology computer science petrochemical engineering geology and marketing in another case in 2016 a young British doctor was arrested for buying drugs and sentenced to over four years in prison the press tells us that in the UK from 2017 to 2018 there were twelve hundred and ten drug seizures relating to the dark web so it might not be as safe as you think scoring your gear that police in the UK said buying your stuff on the dark web carries more risk than buying it in the streets because if your purchase came from abroad you could be said to be an importer the police also added that male services in the UK are getting very good at spotting packages containing such substances okay so let's say you have no intention of reading or viewing gruesome content or procuring a dozen MDMA pills or some such stimulant but then we might ask why are you in the dark web in the first place perhaps you have a legitimate reason in that you want to discuss a sensitive issue about yourself or you're a whistleblower or an at-risk activist in that case go ahead and get down with the dark web but if you don't have those sorts of reasons one can argue that using the dark web is not worth the risk motherboard wrote in 2016 that authorities have developed very sophisticated ways of finding people in the dark web as we said sometimes they're undercover the FBI have been known to sell weapons on the dark web and who knows where they might be lurking motherboard also tells us that the FBI set up one hack wherein a user clicked on a link that was supposed to take them to an unseemly illegal image that person's IP address became known to the FBI what if you had just clicked on that link by accident what if your curiosity just got the better of you as a part of the operation the FBI harvested over 1,000 us-based IP addresses and Europol generated 3229 of its own cases wrote motherboard that article tells us that police units in many countries have now dedicated task forces concentrating on the dark web so you might ask if you really want to be there maybe you went there already and did something illegal well we're told that when police make an arrest of a vendor or someone doing something illegal they often collect IP addresses of people who had connected with that person or persons once summer afternoon you find yourself cleaning out the dusty old attic of the new home you've moved into it's a bit out in the countryside and out of the way what it came cheap the owner seemed very willing to sell it so willing in fact that they seem to have left at least half of their possessions up here in the attic and as you're sorting through the things to trash things to sell and things to keep you come across a strange book it is a simple read cover with just a title no author mr. babadook as you open the book you're surprised to discover that it looks like a children's pop-up book except there's something oddly disturbing about it for one it features a creepy figure dressed in a long black coat and a top hat with what looks like long claws for hands and for the other it comes with the following piece of disturbing poetry if it's in a word or it's in a look you can't get rid of the babadook you read that simple poem aloud and suddenly you think you hear shuffling a fief in the darkness of the attic looking up you're startled to see the figure from the book it's real as it rears up it's full height and displays its clawed hands you suddenly understand why the owners decided to sell this house so cheap hello and welcome to another episode of you versus today we're putting you up against the legendary demon of grief the babadook no one is sure about the origins of the babadook safe to say that it's been around at least since the late Victorian era given its predisposition for the long coats and top hats so popular at the time the babadook could of course be much older than that given that it seems to be mystically linked to a pop-up book that bears its full name the first pop-up books were made in the late 13th century and it's possible that the babadook has been around as long as they have however as a demon the babadook is likely a far more ancient being haunting humanity since its inception it's connection to the pop-up book in question may just be it's chosen avenue of haunting its victims or perhaps part of some mystical banishment the demon suffered at some point it's fast whatever the origins you're gonna have to know what you're up against if you're in the buff Dukes crosshairs as usual this will be a fight to the death or at least a fight to banish the babadook sense it's likely that as a demon it cannot die so what are you potentially facing first and foremost the babadook is in fact a demon which places it in a category aside from spear monster schools or other things that go bump in the night as a demon this means that the babadook is more intelligent than a spirit or a ghoul and thus far more crafty and manipulative it understands humanity in a way that other supernatural creatures can as it draws both from its immortal lifespan of experiences and higher intelligence and thus knows what makes us tick and how to exploit all of our fears fears importance because as a demon the babadook is much like a spirit strengthened by fear and the more scared its victims become the more powerful that the babadook becomes the babadook is however specifically a demon of grief and prefers to target people who have been made vulnerable by deep sadness depression and loss in their lives its hauntings are geared to further deepen those feelings of hopelessness pain and loss until finally pushing its victims into either letting it possess them or doing great acts of violence the babadook has an arsenal of powers at its disposal and will prove difficult to counter first and foremost and has the ability to teleport at will though it does show a preference to teleport to dark and shadowy areas as opposed to brightly lit spaces this may mean that the babadook is tied to the shadows of the world and can move through them freely but has difficulty using its powers to escape in bright light this isn't its only trick though as the babadook also displays a formidable talent for telekinesis able to move objects as large as a couch with its mind it can also shape-shift into people the victim is familiar with or into mundane objects though is given away upon closer inspection so it has an imperfect talent for mimicry lastly it's a keen manipulator using its ability to inflict terror on its victims to gradually breakdown their mental defenses until they do things that the babadook wants which is typically to commit violence so you're up against the dreaded babadook how are you going to defeat this demon of grief first you're going to want to defeat its ability to randomly teleport at will through the shadows this will be key in order to keep the babadook from getting the drop on you and so that you can make sure to land a killing blow when the time comes in order to counter the babadook sibility to randomly teleport away from you you're going to want to get your hands on a piece of hardware like the by sight LEDs like which can put out as much as six thousand lumens up to a range of 800 meters that's half as bright as the Sun reflecting off white snow and prolonged exposure directly to the eyes can lead to permanent vision problems with a miniature Sun in your hands you'll be able to blast away even the deepest darkest shadows and with the ability to flood you'll scatter any shadows directly in front of you leaving no room for the babadook to hide of course that still leaves all the dark areas behind you that it could try to flee to so you're gonna need something that can light up really large areas like the rising of a second Sun and nothing can light up large swaths of ground quite like an arm axe the tool of choice by professional filmmakers who will need to work outdoors in the middle of the night the autumn axe is a whopping eighteen thousand watt light that can be hoisted up into the air on a crane or secured to a sturdy tree with this monster like blasting your surroundings the babadook will have absolutely nowhere to hide so you've taken care of its ability to teleport leaving the babadook with nowhere to hide you'll have to watch out for its ability to use telekinesis to move objects around which it will no doubt try to use as a weapon against you but as long as you're keeping a sharp eye on your environment and keeping your head on a swivel you should be fine what you should be most concerned about it's its ability to manipulate your fears like many evil creatures that go bump in the night the babadook is strengthened by fear so you're gonna have to keep a firm grip on what scares you unlike other demons or similar creatures that feed on fear though the babadook specifically feeds off grief as well and fear that stems from that grief so your next weapon is going to be to arm yourself with some peace of mind if you're holding on to any particular pain or loss let it go try to be grateful for the things that you've already have in your life and try to take joy in the accomplishments you achieve such as the imminent babadook kill you're about to score because you're a Zen master and this shifty demon can't find any weak spots in your psyche to exploit you've stripped the babadook of its ability to teleport away you've remember the five DS of dodgeball and dodged ducked dipped dope and dodged everything it's tried to hurl at you with telekinesis and when it tried to manipulate your grief and fear you shut the babadook down with a Dali Lama like level of self mastery now it's time to go for the kill and end this death match once and for all sending the steamin have grief back to the fiery hell that spawned it as you probably know by now from watching our other episodes we here at the infographic show our fans of problem solving through superior firepower and in this case we have one and only one tool to recommend a surefire way to bless this hell spawn out of this world and back into its own the Super Soaker scattered blast blaster that's right a squirt gun only not any regular type of squirt gun a 22 ounce beast that can deliver shotgun like blasts of water up to 34 feet away except you're not going to be blasting the babadook with any regular type of water you're gonna be using holy water blessed by a priest as a demon the babadook is bound to rules of our prime material plane if it chooses to manifest physically that means that the babadook took solid form in order to directly manipulate our world then it's body would be subject to the same rules as our own bodies or anything else physical in which case we'd recommend firepower on a level much higher than the squirt gun however because the babadook doesn't manifest physically it can't be harmed physically that's why it needs to hot victims in order to eventually wear them down and commit the violence it can't commit itself so to excommunicate this demon out of our world and back to its own at least temporarily you're gonna have to hit it with the only thing all demons can't stand corporal or non corporal holy water water blessed by true faith in the divine is the Anathem uh to and has the power not just to hurt evil but to dispel it all together with the tank full of blessed water your super soaker scatter blaster is a demon blasting weapon that Michael the Archangel would be envious of that is of course if the water you're using has been blessed by a priest with true faith something very very rare in our world today otherwise well you're really only going to be making a very angry demon soaking wet moments before it rips your soul from your body and inhabits you forever in terms of mysteries of the criminal world and the whodunit question that eclipses all others there is nothing more mysterious than who was Jack the Ripper you might have seen countless movies on the subject read myriad books on the topic or listens to a plethora of online sleuths that think they have correct the mystery but let's face it it was always a guessing game there's been absurd speculation as well as more thorough investigation but the man that eviscerated women on the streets of London has never had his scooby-doo ask de nominally kids are on the block and they might have figured this mystery out we've already done our Jack the Ripper show and epic if we say so for ourselves that was welcomed by our viewers you might not have seen that so for those of you who are not first in the history of this serial killer we'll give you a quick rundown on the strife and crimes of mr. Ripper towards the 1880s in the city of London perhaps the center of the world at the time but also imparts a dirty rotten festering maze of slums replete with wandering gin addicts and foul mouthed harlots London was experiencing a population explosion with immigrants from around the world coming to the great city to find work but it wasn't exactly the Land of Hope and Glory for everybody and some of the streets in the poorer East End of the city were a long way from being a yellow brick road the rise in population not surprisingly caused friction between the new denizens and the ones born on the cobbled streets while the factory owners were happy for the cheap labor these were fractious times and outbreaks of violence and other criminality were common this is where our man Jack the Ripper chose to ply his trade you might ask what what's his trade well that was nabbing mostly working girls from the streets and brutally killing them he might tear at their faces with a sharp blade like a wild animal might do but other times he skilfully removed their organs with the deft hands of a surgeon for this he became known as the Ripper other rippers would follow in the years to come the Yorkshire Ripper up north and Bradford or over the pond the Ripper of Times Square but they were different Jack may well have been educated in human anatomy and as we say he had the precise skills it takes for surgical exploration in organ removal it's thought he may have murdered 11 people but the cops only ever said for sure that he killed five these became known as the canonical five we don't often the tribute cannons to killers but Jack was special the British media lapped it up publishing piece after piece on this boogeyman that wandered the dark streets at night police interviewed thousands of Londoners they summarily locked up people hired sleuths and patrolled the streets and alleyways 24/7 but Jack eluded them was he a surgeon a physician was he some educated upper-class untouchable what made things worse his police received two letters many with atrocious grammar and spelling skills which were supposedly from the killer many were just hoaxes written by bored EastEnders who had little or no respect for the cops but one letter titled from hell police believed was real they never got their man and the case went on and on for years there have been some main suspects over time and no serious Ripper ologists don't give credence to the possibility of him being the aristocrat Prince Albert Victor Christian Edward the Duke of Clarence that just makes a compelling tale and something the poor disenfranchised Brits would love to be true because it might vindicate their conviction of the ruling class being wicked no one seriously thought it was the creator of Alice in Wonderland Lewis Carroll despite the clamoring of some rather wide-eyed conspiracy theorists was it a cover-up Minnie asked because in such an intractable class system you just can't have the people at the top of the pyramid ripping young girls to pieces and evacuating their uterus that would have been poor play by the tops in charge so perhaps Jack's identity was known but this theory didn't pass muster none of them did not until now there has been one name on the list of men behind the Ripper mask but he hasn't been talked about much until now his name was Aaron Kosminski occupation barber yep imagine getting a close shave from a polish barber with a penchant for slicing people open we know it was him well according to a forensic investigation published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences in March 2019 they know this because of DNA found on a shawl of one of his victims okay so you might have heard this before and indeed in our very own Jack the Ripper show we said there was one theory about kozminski because of his DNA but the trouble back then was that none of the DNA evidence was supported it was mostly down to a well-off businessman and Ripper researcher called Russell Edwards the thing is that evidence was not peer-reviewed by any number of other scientists it has been now we're told that two researchers called VRE loja Lyman and David Miller ran genetic tests on semen and blood on that Shaw we just mentioned that was found next to the murdered Catherine Eddowes they then compared mitochondrial DNA from Eidos present family members as well as people from the present kozminski family they concluded that the Ripper was indeed one of their ancestors they also said it's very likely Jack the Ripper had blue eyes and brown hair and this is what many mainstream news media was reporting finally we found our man Jack the lad was a 23 year old pole that went to London and trimmed mustaches cut hair and also the odd stomach wide open researchers wrote in that paper that the Shaw referred to in this paper is the only piece of physical evidence known to be associated with these murders the DNA found on that shawl should be passed down from mother to mother and DNA could be traced back to the Polish man's family we know quite a bit about our boy who moved over to the Whitechapel area a slum in London and there he set up shop but it said in 1891 Mr kozminski was sent to one of London's finest insane asylums he was apparently an on-and-off lunatic doing some barber work and then being looked after by his family and then sometimes he was back inside with the people screaming at the moon it said he suffered a kind of psychosis it's also said that his utterly insane behavior led to him being sent to the workhouse what we have is a man who was in and out of asylums while those murders were on so you could say his face now fits the picture god knows who his customers were at the barber shop in Whitechapel or if he had packed that in once he started to hear voices he trashed from the streets and self-abuse that was a fine English euphemism for what the Brits later would called a Five Knuckle shuffle there's also evidence in those psychiatric reports that he had threatened a sister with a knife the thing is of course he doesn't sound much like a skilled surgeon nor a man who was a droid enough to never leave any evidence behind and then we have the naysayers these critics were doubtful of the first time the Polish man was connected to the murders and say the latest conclusions were partly predicated on that original 2014 paper Forbes reported just after everyone was saying finally we found him that the new paper contained three parts hogwash we're sorry to burst your bubble but form cites a group of archaeological geneticists who said that even if the shawl was left behind by a victim still the way it's been handled since would render DNA analysis cripplingly problematic why is that well it's been an item over the year that has been passed around touched by many many hands and left in places for people to view it's hardly a fine specimen for DNA analysis said the scientists another British geneticist wrote this how did this ever get past review primers not listed data not presented was it done in a proper forensic DNA lab unpublishable steady on old chap surely you can't just discount the new paper well one other person in the geneticist milieu said this the suspect couldn't have passed on his mitochondrial DNA as he was a man these academics don't mince their words either sometimes sounding like they were prepared to take a straight razor to the jugular of those that published the paper nonsense like this paper and a gullible media does nothing but ferment scientific and historical illiteracy built upon the grotesque romanticism of the brutal murders of five women said one of them no doubt words spat through a mist of strong English tea and bits of scone but as some academics pointed out you can't just go around saying it was the kozminski kid without having absolute irrefutable proof if only because there are a bunch of people in Poland or perhaps still in England whose friends have suddenly started hiding the knives when they've been invited around for dinner the question of his identity I am confident will never be known concluded the angry professor we just quoted as some commenters say it's kozminski did do it was he really clever enough to just disappear after each murder how come he never told anyone else not even when he was locked up where did he get the surgical skills from can we not find out if any one of the murders happened during the spurts he had outside of the asylum as for the new evidence the researchers have admitted that they would not use it if it were for a present criminal trial can we rely on that Shaw and the new results we might tell you what one other scientist in the bio game said and he was less critical than that angry mob of geneticists the data at least in the weak form presented here increased the likelihood that Aaron Kosminski who was a suspect in the murders was the killer he said but we're a long way from knowing who butchered those five women caveat lector what do you think about all of this tell us in the comments also be sure to check out our other show why was Jack the Ripper never found

vZlmUG00OrI,Internet Historian,"Comedy,Informative",Brad's Wife,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZlmUG00OrI,3 years ago,7.1M views,"Comedy,Informative","Sponsored by Dashlane! February 27th 2017 A woman comes home to deliver her husband... some bad news. She has been fired from her job at Cracker Barrel. They gave no notice. They gave no reason. The husband, Brad, embraces her. A tear rolls down her cheek... Brad's hands tighten into fists. ....11 Years of service.... ...He whispers under his breath. ""Nanette... fetch me the computer."" (No Brad, wait-) ""Annnnnd, send."" ""That'll do it."" With that, he put his arm around Nannette. And they fell asleep together on the couch. A week passes.... It's Brad's birthday! ""Hey Nannette, has there been any word back yet on why you're fired?"" ""This old boy is still storming!"" *thunder crashes* She shook her head. ""Outrageous!"" ""Nannette, fetch me the computer again."" ""I'm going to make another Facebook post."" Today is my... ＢＩＲＴＨＤＡＹ Why did you fire.... My My Ẇ̵̗̜̑͜Í̴͔͌̋͒̍͘F̶̨͔̣̪͖̬̯͍̍̑͂͊͛È̵̞̹̒̊̄͠ Now we wait. (Don't forget your cake!) Brad squinted his eyes. Made a wish... and blew. He put his arm around Nannette and again they fell asleep together on the couch. But that night as they dreamed something special happened, a miracle of sorts. People started joining in. People saw the post, then semi-sarcastically also began demanding answers. Then more joined in. Then more... The template of the joke was simple and spreadable. Promoting desserts, are we? Brad's wife used to LOVE desserts! New item on the menu? Brad's wife would have made it TWICE as good! Today we remember 9/11? Brad's wife used to love ni- It spread from their Facebook, to their Twitter, to their Instagram to ALL of their social media platforms. But this wasn't your usual raid by 4chan... This was something different... An army of mostly boomers putting Cracker over the Barrel. It was the moms and dads of Middle America leading the charge. And Brad was there... As the standard bearer. He embraced the meme. He repeated. He demanded. Soon there wasn't anything Cracker Barrel could post that wouldn't immediately be turned into a discussion of the plight of poor Nanette. As always, a petition is started and goes nowhere. And once that failed, the calls started rolling in. ""Hi, I have a quick question for you guys."" ""Yes?"" ""Why did you guys fire Brad's wife?"" ""So, uh, I guess what I'm asking is if you would just go ahead and hire her back.."" ""Uh, and then we could just pretend like this whole thing didn't happen."" And what's a good harassment campaign, without a soundtrack? ♪ You just fired her on.. Brad's birthdayyy..♪ ♪ Where's the justice for Brad's wiffeee? ♪ ♪ If YoU WaNnA hAvE yOuR bReAkFeAsT mAade ♪      (No God, please, No!) Other companies saw this meme, and decided to add fuel to the fire. On social media, they were posting about Brad's wife. In IRL, they were posting signs promoting Brad's wife. And that prompted the news to get involved.. More teens are having fuck. H-having-- Coverage from People Magazine, The Mirror, Washington Post, 4chan, and many, many, many more. That's when things really started to spread out into the streets. People made posters, signs, and t-shirts. And they even started visting the restaurant just to ask about Brad's wife. ""Who's Brad?"" ""Well Brad's not important. But his wife, they fired her, after eleven years of service"". ""I don't know what you're talking about"". ""After eleven years..."" ""On his birthday..."" ""Is that.. I heard about that! That was terrible!"" ""Yeah, now there's a wait time in here."" ""How long?"" ""Oh, it's a long time."" 'Cause Brad's wife isn't here. #JusticeForBrad'sWife Brad could see that things were spiraling out of control. He called on the troops not to harass the local chain. The firing was a corporate decision. But it did little to temper things down. (Grr!) ""YoU fIrEd BrAd's WiFe? YOu ShAlL bE oN fIrE!"" So in all this time, Brad still hadn't heard back from the company. And we feared that we'd never get answers. But one smooth-talker succeeded in getting a few details by pretending to be a manager from the corporate office. And that's when she spilled the beans. Now, from here, we could've just called it a day. They don't know how to let a joke go. When something is funny, it remains funny to them for YEARS. And that doesn't spell good news for Cracker Barrel's social media. So, that's what the future holds for Cracker Barrel. Years more of #Brad'sWife. Well, there's good news. It turns out that a lot of those offers by others businesses to hire Brad's wife weren't entirely sarcastic. Eleven years of service? Come on in for an interview! Dozens and dozens of REAL offers started rolling in. Suddenly, Brad's wife had her pick. And she could work.. pretty much anywhere she wanted. You can still visit Cracker Barrel today, and the top comment will still be: Some dumb shit about firing Brad's wife. Because better than an answer, Brad got his wife a new job.

Os3jAjpzUaU,LevelCapGaming,VideoGames,Battlefield 4 - Loadout: Navy Seal M416 & Hi-Tech Gear,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Os3jAjpzUaU,7 years ago,1.5M views,VideoGames,[Music] you hey guys level-cap here today is Monday which means it's time for an episode of loadout this series where you guys the viewers get to pick a gun and customization for me to use the way you do this is you leave a comment down below letting me know what you'd like me to run with now we'll pick one of the top rated comments for the next episode today's top comment comes from seals SF Nucci he says Navy SEAL loadout the hk416 standard suppressor laser light combo angled grip hollow sight desert camo sig p226 standard suppressor TAC light iron sights desert camo m67 frag grenades med pack and 320 HP offensive or stealth perk not too familiar with the perks desert camo on the soldier Navy SEALs carry the most expensive and high quality gear on the market they serve a great advantage in real life and I want to see how it plays out in battlefield 4 now certainly these attachments make the hk416 look really awesome the desert camel also serves to just make it look like it blends in especially when I'm playing on a desert map it makes a bit more sense the holo sight on top here in real life is called an EOTech and they're expensive holographic sights they're certainly very cool-looking and I'm sure they are widely used throughout the military now the laser light combo sometimes referred to in real life as a Peck box is a real attachment they're expensive they have high-quality lasers they have flashlights you can have the option of them both being on at the same time often there's an infrared option too so if you're I guess doing a nighttime stealth mission you can have a laser that only shows up on your infrared night vision now the last attachment on this weapon is the suppressor which I recommend for almost all game types unless you're going for exclusively long range kills it is going to hurt your ability to take down targets at range but other than that it keeps you off the mini-map which is such an important thing in battlefield especially with this many players in any game I think I'm playing in a 48 player team deathmatch server and when you got 48 players which means that there's 24 enemies that you got to worry about if you pop up on that mini-map that's 24 potential people that know exactly where you are so keeping yourself off that mini-map is infinitely beneficial and I did forget to mention the angled foregrip which in real life makes you hold the gun in a different manner which has been proven to help you control the weapon it is a little bit more awkward if you're holding it the exact way you're intended to with the angled four grip but I've seen some examples of this and it looks pretty cool when in terms of like actually trying to control weapon recoil while firing and the effects of the attachment in the game actually affect your first shot recoil they reduce it significantly which I guess does actually make a bit of sense considering how the real one is supposed to work now let's talk about this 416 it's a great assault rifle it was certainly one of my favourite assault rifles in battlefield 3 and it continues to be one of my favorites in battlefield 4 it's just across the board a very very good performing weapon from it's extremely fast reload of 1.85 seconds for the short reload which is gonna allow you to just get that next mag in there ASAP - it's like very very competitive rate of fire 750 rounds per minute yeah it's not as quite quite as fast as the AEK or the FAMAS or the mtar but 750 is still enough to deal with most threats and because it's slightly less than the other ones you have more controllable recoil which is gonna make it a little bit more effective at range than some of the other weapons normally it has a pretty decent muzzle velocity of 600 m/s but when you select a suppressor on there it drops your muzzle velocity down to closer to 300 m/s which is why the suppressor really makes weapons very ineffective at range so it's why I'm essentially missing a lot of long-range targets moving targets here I'm just not leading properly because when you're not used to the suppressor you really have to extra lead on targets also the lack of having a stubby grip on here is going to make my bullets spray a little bit more so again it's not going to be that great at range and I ran out of ammo at the 416 so I picked up a mark 11 to finish off some baddies in this kill streak and the mark 11 certainly is a decent DMR now overall I actually really like running with the suppressed m416 the only issue I'm having is that the angled for grip doesn't really fit into the build in terms of the game mechanics that well one thing that would certainly fit this whole Navy SEALs theme is using a ergo grip instead of the angled four grip simply put you don't have enough vertical recoil to justify a angled four grip on this weapon and an Ergo grip gives you better accuracy while you're moving around now since this with a suppressor is going to get you in close quarters hitting a lot of closer range targets you will be moving around a bit more while taking shots and this guy's just blocking whoa I hate it when people do that but you will be moving around more in close quarters so it seems to make more sense to use an Ergo grip and take advantage of some of that side strafing while shooting accuracy now the p226 is actually an excellent sidearm in battlefield it's an excellent sidearm in real life but in battlefield it really is one of my favorite none automatic pistols are non burst fire pistols putting the suppressor on there it's just the next way to stay off the mini-map putting the TAC light on there is also great for blinding your foes in close quarters obviously it works a bit better on darker Maps now because we're running the laser light combo on the 416 for the most part I had the laser on which is going to improve my hipfire accuracy which is great for close quarters and furthermore why it would have been awesome to have an Ergo grip on here because this would have made it a very very lethal close quarter weapon I'm not saying it's not right now it's a very very effective close quarter weapon but forego grip plus laser sight and suppressor all of a sudden you got a gun you don't even need to aim down sights and you can move while shooting in close quarters and you're not gonna pop on the mini-map I don't really know how it gets any more ideal for close quarters than that now I really love the look of the EOTech on here or the holo sight is this called in-game I really like the red dot in the middle it gives you those little distance markers which are very helpful if you have a suppressor because your shots are gonna drop more at range and if you decide that you need to take shots at somebody very far away those little distance markers can be just nice little ways of sort of pinpointing how high you have to aim above your target to hit them in the head with the bullet drop one of the unfortunate discrepancies between video games sights and real-life sights red dot sights that is anyway is that in real life you can open both your eyes while aiming down a red dot sight thus the metal housing around the site really doesn't have much of an impact on what you see in the environment you can actually replicate this right now by just cupping your hands so you make a hole with it holding it up in front of one of your eyes and as you look forward you can see that you can see through your hand it's not gonna really block your vision and that's because you have stereo vision as opposed to the singular vision from your monitor but alas the holo sight in battlefield will always be inferior to sites like the coyote sight in the Cobra site simply because the mental housing is smaller on those sites anyway that pretty much wraps it up for this episode of loadout the 416 is a great gun to use if you're going to use this loadout I would just recommend swapping out the angled for grip for the Ergo grip you're probably gonna do a little bit better in close quarters as always guys thanks for watching don't forget to leave your comments down below for next episode and I'll see you next time this is level-cap signing off [Music] you,8:40

IHZwWFHWa-w,3Blue1Brown,Science,"Gradient descent, how neural networks learn | Chapter 2, Deep learning",1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHZwWFHWa-w,4 years ago,4.4M views,Science,"Last video I laid out the structure of a neural network I'll give a quick recap here just so that it's fresh in our minds And then I have two main goals for this video. The first is to introduce the idea of gradient descent, which underlies not only how neural networks learn, but how a lot of other machine learning works as well Then after that we're going to dig in a little more to how this particular network performs And what those hidden layers of neurons end up actually looking for As a reminder our goal here is the classic example of handwritten digit recognition the hello world of neural networks these digits are rendered on a 28 by 28 pixel grid each pixel with some grayscale value between 0 & 1 those are what determine the activations of 784 neurons in the input layer of the network and Then the activation for each neuron in the following layers is based on a weighted sum of All the activations in the previous layer plus some special number called a bias then you compose that sum with some other function like the sigmoid squishification or a ReLu the way that I walked through last video In total given the somewhat arbitrary choice of two hidden layers here with 16 neurons each the network has about 13,000 weights and biases that we can adjust and it's these values that determine what exactly the network you know actually does Then what we mean when we say that this network classifies a given digit Is that the brightest of those 10 neurons in the final layer corresponds to that digit And remember the motivation that we had in mind here for the layered structure was that maybe The second layer could pick up on the edges and the third layer might pick up on patterns like loops and lines And the last one could just piece together those patterns to recognize digits So here we learn how the network learns What we want is an algorithm where you can show this network a whole bunch of training data which comes in the form of a bunch of different images of handwritten digits along with labels for what they're supposed to be and It'll adjust those 13000 weights and biases so as to improve its performance on the training data Hopefully this layered structure will mean that what it learns generalizes to images beyond that training data And the way we test that is that after you train the network You show it more labeled theta that it's never seen before and you see how accurately it classifies those new images Fortunately for us and what makes this such a common example to start with is that the good people behind the MNIST base have put together a collection of tens of thousands of handwritten digit images each one labeled with the numbers that they're supposed to be and It's provocative as it is to describe a machine as learning once you actually see how it works It feels a lot less like some crazy sci-fi premise and a lot more like well a calculus exercise I mean basically it comes down to finding the minimum of a certain function Remember conceptually we're thinking of each neuron as being connected to all of the neurons in the previous layer and the weights in the weighted sum defining its activation are kind of like the strengths of those connections And the bias is some indication of whether that neuron tends to be active or inactive and to start things off We're just gonna initialize all of those weights and biases totally randomly needless to say this network is going to perform pretty horribly on a given training example since it's just doing something random for example you feed in this image of a 3 and the Output layer it just looks like a mess So what you do is you define a cost function a way of telling the computer: ""No bad computer! That output should have activations which are zero for most neurons, but one for this neuron what you gave me is utter trash"" To say that a little more mathematically what you do is add up the squares of the differences between each of those trash output activations and the value that you want them to have and This is what we'll call the cost of a single training example Notice this sum is small when the network confidently classifies the image correctly But it's large when the network seems like it doesn't really know what it's doing So then what you do is consider the average cost over all of the tens of thousands of training examples at your disposal This average cost is our measure for how lousy the network is and how bad the computer should feel, and that's a complicated thing Remember how the network itself was basically a function one that takes in 784 numbers as inputs the pixel values and spits out ten numbers as its output and in a sense It's parameterised by all these weights and biases While the cost function is a layer of complexity on top of that it takes as its input those thirteen thousand or so weights and biases and it spits out a single number describing how bad those weights and biases are and The way it's defined depends on the network's behavior over all the tens of thousands of pieces of training data That's a lot to think about But just telling the computer what a crappy job, it's doing isn't very helpful You want to tell it how to change those weights and biases so that it gets better? To make it easier rather than struggling to imagine a function with 13,000 inputs Just imagine a simple function that has one number as an input and one number as an output How do you find an input that minimizes the value of this function? Calculus students will know that you can sometimes figure out that minimum explicitly But that's not always feasible for really complicated functions Certainly not in the thirteen thousand input version of this situation for our crazy complicated neural network cost function A more flexible tactic is to start at any old input and figure out which direction you should step to make that output lower Specifically if you can figure out the slope of the function where you are Then shift to the left if that slope is positive and shift the input to the right if that slope is negative If you do this repeatedly at each point checking the new slope and taking the appropriate step you're gonna approach some local minimum of the function and the image you might have in mind here is a ball rolling down a hill and Notice even for this really simplified single input function there are many possible valleys that you might land in Depending on which random input you start at and there's no guarantee that the local minimum You land in is going to be the smallest possible value of the cost function That's going to carry over to our neural network case as well, and I also want you to notice How if you make your step sizes proportional to the slope Then when the slope is flattening out towards the minimum your steps get smaller and smaller and that kind of helps you from overshooting Bumping up the complexity a bit imagine instead a function with two inputs and one output You might think of the input space as the XY plane and the cost function as being graphed as a surface above it Now instead of asking about the slope of the function you have to ask which direction should you step in this input space? So as to decrease the output of the function most quickly in other words. What's the downhill direction? And again it's helpful to think of a ball rolling down that hill Those of you familiar with multivariable calculus will know that the gradient of a function gives you the direction of steepest ascent Basically, which direction should you step to increase the function most quickly naturally enough taking the negative of that gradient gives you the direction to step that decreases the function most quickly and Even more than that the length of this gradient vector is actually an indication for just how steep that steepest slope is Now if you're unfamiliar with multivariable calculus And you want to learn more check out some of the work that I did for Khan Academy on the topic Honestly, though all that matters for you and me right now Is that in principle there exists a way to compute this vector. This vector that tells you what the Downhill direction is and how steep it is you'll be okay if that's all you know and you're not rock solid on the details because if you can get that the algorithm from minimizing the function is to compute this gradient direction then take a small step downhill and Just repeat that over and over It's the same basic idea for a function that has 13,000 inputs instead of two inputs imagine organizing all 13,000 weights and biases of our network into a giant column vector The negative gradient of the cost function is just a vector It's some Direction inside this insanely huge input space that tells you which nudges to all of those numbers is going to cause the most rapid decrease to the cost function and of course with our specially designed cost function Changing the weights and biases to decrease it means making the output of the network on each piece of training data Look less like a random array of ten values and more like an actual decision that we want it to make It's important to remember this cost function involves an average over all of the training data So if you minimize it it means it's a better performance on all of those samples The algorithm for computing this gradient efficiently which is effectively the heart of how a neural network learns is called back propagation And it's what I'm going to be talking about next video There I really want to take the time to walk through What exactly happens to each weight and each bias for a given piece of training data? Trying to give an intuitive feel for what's happening beyond the pile of relevant calculus and formulas Right here right now the main thing. I want you to know independent of implementation details is that what we mean when we talk about a network learning is that it's just minimizing a cost function and Notice one consequence of that is that it's important for this cost function to have a nice smooth output So that we can find a local minimum by taking little steps downhill This is why by the way Artificial neurons have continuously ranging activations rather than simply being active or inactive in a binary way if the way that biological neurons are This process of repeatedly nudging an input of a function by some multiple of the negative gradient is called gradient descent It's a way to converge towards some local minimum of a cost function basically a valley in this graph I'm still showing the picture of a function with two inputs of course because nudges in a thirteen thousand dimensional input Space are a little hard to wrap your mind around, but there is actually a nice non-spatial way to think about this Each component of the negative gradient tells us two things the sign of course tells us whether the corresponding Component of the input vector should be nudged up or down, but importantly the relative magnitudes of all these components Kind of tells you which changes matter more You see in our network an adjustment to one of the weights might have a much greater impact on the cost function than the adjustment to some other weight Some of these connections just matter more for our training data So a way that you can think about this gradient vector of our mind-warpingly massive cost function is that it encodes the relative importance of each weight and bias That is which of these changes is going to carry the most bang for your buck This really is just another way of thinking about direction To take a simpler example if you have some function with two variables as an input and you Compute that its gradient at some particular point comes out as (3,1) Then on the one hand you can interpret that as saying that when you're standing at that input moving along this direction increases the function most quickly That when you graph the function above the plane of input points that vector is what's giving you the straight uphill direction But another way to read that is to say that changes to this first variable Have three times the importance as changes to the second variable that at least in the neighborhood of the relevant input Nudging the x value carries a lot more bang for your buck All right Let's zoom out and sum up where we are so far the network itself is this function with 784 inputs and 10 outputs defined in terms of all of these weighted sums the cost function is a layer of complexity on top of that it takes the 13,000 weights and biases as inputs and spits out a single measure of lousyness based on the training examples and The gradient of the cost function is one more layer of complexity still it tells us What nudges to all of these weights and biases cause the fastest change to the value of the cost function Which you might interpret is saying which changes to which weights matter the most So when you initialize the network with random weights and biases and adjust them many times based on this gradient descent process How well does it actually perform on images that it's never seen before? Well the one that I've described here with the two hidden layers of sixteen neurons each chosen mostly for aesthetic reasons well, it's not bad it classifies about 96 percent of the new images that it sees correctly and Honestly, if you look at some of the examples that it messes up on you kind of feel compelled to cut it a little slack Now if you play around with the hidden layer structure and make a couple tweaks You can get this up to 98% and that's pretty good. It's not the best You can certainly get better performance by getting more sophisticated than this plain vanilla Network But given how daunting the initial task is I just think there's something? Incredible about any network doing this well on images that it's never seen before Given that we never specifically told it what patterns to look for Originally the way that I motivated this structure was by describing a hope that we might have That the second layer might pick up on little edges That the third layer would piece together those edges to recognize loops and longer lines and that those might be pieced together to recognize digits So is this what our network is actually doing? Well for this one at least Not at all remember how last video we looked at how the weights of the Connections from all of the neurons in the first layer to a given neuron in the second layer Can be visualized as a given pixel pattern that that second layer neuron is picking up on Well when we actually do that for the weights associated with these transitions from the first layer to the next Instead of picking up on isolated little edges here and there. They look well almost random Just put some very loose patterns in the middle there it would seem that in the unfathomably large 13,000 dimensional space of possible weights and biases our network found itself a happy little local minimum that despite successfully classifying most images doesn't exactly pick up on the patterns that we might have hoped for and To really drive this point home watch what happens when you input a random image if the system was smart you might expect it to either feel uncertain maybe not really activating any of those 10 output neurons or Activating them all evenly But instead it Confidently gives you some nonsense answer as if it feels as sure that this random noise is a 5 as it does that an actual image of a 5 is a 5 phrase differently even if this network can recognize digits pretty well it has no idea how to draw them a Lot of this is because it's such a tightly constrained training setup I mean put yourself in the network's shoes here from its point of view the entire universe consists of nothing But clearly defined unmoving digits centered in a tiny grid and its cost function just never gave it any Incentive to be anything, but utterly confident in its decisions So if this is the image of what those second layer neurons are really doing You might wonder why I would introduce this network with the motivation of picking up on edges and patterns I mean, that's just not at all what it ends up doing Well, this is not meant to be our end goal, but instead a starting point frankly This is old technology the kind researched in the 80s and 90s and You do need to understand it before you can understand more detailed modern variants and it clearly is capable of solving some interesting problems But the more you dig in to what those hidden layers are really doing the less intelligent it seems Shifting the focus for a moment from how networks learn to how you learn That'll only happen if you engage actively with the material here somehow One pretty simple thing that I want you to do is just pause right now and think deeply for a moment about what Changes you might make to this system And how it perceives images if you wanted it to better pick up on things like edges and patterns? But better than that to actually engage with the material I Highly recommend the book by Michael Nielsen on deep learning and neural networks In it you can find the code and the data to download and play with for this exact example And the book will walk you through step by step what that code is doing What's awesome is that this book is free and publicly available So if you do get something out of it consider joining me in making a donation towards Nielsen's efforts I've also linked a couple other resources that I like a lot in the description including the phenomenal and beautiful blog post by Chris Ola and the articles in distill To close things off here for the last few minutes I want to jump back into a snippet of the interview that I had with Leisha Lee You might remember her from the last video. She did her PhD work in deep learning and in this little snippet She talks about two recent papers that really dig into how some of the more modern image recognition networks are actually learning Just to set up where we were in the conversation the first paper took one of these particularly deep neural networks That's really good at image recognition and instead of training it on a properly labeled data Set it shuffled all of the labels around before training Obviously the testing accuracy here was going to be no better than random since everything's just randomly labeled But it was still able to achieve the same training accuracy as you would on a properly labeled dataset Basically the millions of weights for this particular network were enough for it to just memorize the random data Which kind of raises the question for whether minimizing this cost function actually corresponds to any sort of structure in the image? Or is it just you know? memorize the entire Data set of what the correct classification is and so a couple of you know half a year later at ICML this year There was not exactly rebuttal paper paper that addressed some asked like hey Actually these networks are doing something a little bit smarter than that if you look at that accuracy curve if you were just training on a Random data set that curve sort of went down very you know very slowly in almost kind of a linear fashion So you're really struggling to find that local minima of possible you know the right weights that would get you that accuracy whereas if you're actually training on a structured data set one that has the Right labels. You know you fiddle around a little bit in the beginning, but then you kind of dropped very fast to get to that Accuracy level and so in some sense it was easier to find that Local maxima and so it was also interesting about that is it caught brings into light another paper from actually a couple of years ago Which has a lot more simplifications about the network layers But one of the results was saying how if you look at the optimization landscape the local minima that these networks tend to learn are Actually of equal quality so in some sense if your data set is structure, and you should be able to find that much more easily My thanks as always to those of you supporting on patreon I've said before just what a game-changer patreon is but these videos really would not be possible without you I Also want to give a special. Thanks to the VC firm amplifi partners in their support of these initial videos in the series They focus on very early stage machine learning and AI companies and I feel pretty confident in the Probabilities that some of you watching this and even more likely some of the people that you know are right now in the early stages of getting such a company off the ground and The amplifi folks would love to hear from any such founders and they even set up an email address just for this video that you can reach out to them through three blue one brown at amplify partners com",21:01

to this billboards placement it would have cost at least $10,000 at the time as thousands of people would have been impressed by it over its existence in subsequent years more billboards would continue to pop up that were almost identical in nature these billboards simply read get out of your mind and link to a website called Nero cam com these billboards promptly garnered tons of speculation from the local press and many articles promptly took to the story to provide further attention to this mysterious piece of advertising at first glance this individual billboard obviously looks like some kind of marketing stunt to get individuals intrigued in some kind of product it would appear like this company is trying to manipulate us onto their site obviously someone paying for a billboard must be looking for a way to make some money back on their investment 99.9% of the time that would be the exact case but not with Nero cam it's fair to say that these billboards would end up being something that no one could have anticipated all I can say about these billboards right now is that the only way I can describe it to you is that these lead down one of the most bizarre and

Hastings will further inform you of the nature of tasks neural cam requires you to complete any unsuccessful application will result in the cessation of further correspondence between neuro cam and yourself neuro cam appreciates that in eighty three point six percent of instances new applicants experience a desire to inquire about many issues which may further enlighten them as to the true nature of neuro cam due to the need to maintain a high level of operational security neuro cam is unable to provide much of the information desired by entry level participants thank you once again for expressing interest in neuro cam I hope that your application will be successful and I will soon have the pleasure of working with you regards Maxwell Knight head Human Resources Security Division neuro cam international taking a look at this first email we can see why this interestingly build more desire for users inquiring they weren't directly dropped into what exactly what this was the mention of a need for a background check obviously adds a certain degree of speculation as to what the hell is going on here not to mention the further requirement to after waiting a week made people even more eager to learn what was going on in most cases for something like this you'd expect an automated email right after you signed up but this simply wasn't the circumstance after a week later another email would come through dear applicant to continue with narrow Cam's application process all applicants are required to complete the following perception based assessment an assessment of the applicants suitability for operational deployment will be made following the fulfillment of these non-negotiable prerequisites application perception assessment and CI - mm 1/1 part a mission assess applicant's perception abilities Part B execution point number one write a detailed account of everything that happens between four and nine pm pay particular attention to any occurrence which may be deemed out of the ordinary including your account two images that represent the best and worse things to happen on that particular date point number two submit this report and via email to operations at neural cam comm by close of business date Part C operational security not applicable Part D guidelines as with all neuro cam assignments you will be assessed on the manner in which you complete this assignment intelligence and creativity are traits highly valued by neuro cam and a demonstration of both of these will expedite your further advancement within the organization your application and aptitude in this assignment will be the basis for consideration for operational integration ends applicant perception assessment NCI - mm 1/1 regards Charles Hastings head operations division neuro cam international operations at neurochemical here we see in this email that part of their initiation they were required to complete an assignment by a certain deadline to receive further correspondence for what possible reason what they need you to note anything that happens within a 5 hour time window this is a long period of time but it seems like the motive for creating something like this would be to condition your applicants that if they wanted to know the answers and what was going on here they were gonna have to dedicate some time from the get-go if they wanted any answers I will read on from the blog post following this individual as they went through with this assignment for a little bit though I will let his writing take over for a moment the following Monday at 4 p.m. i armed myself with a notebook in a small digital camera i finished my work around 5:00 and was home around 6 I made dinner and watched some TV I didn't notice anything particularly out of the ordinary but I thought that maybe I was looking too hard during the tram ride home I was hyper aware of everyone around me and it seemed that several of them were staring at me or was I staring at them when I got off the tram I kept checking to see if anyone was following me when at home I frequently looked out the windows to see if anyone was watching me from a parked car outside I waited for strange phone calls or a knock at the door nothing happened I paid extra attention to the TV thinking perhaps that they would try to get a message to me that way but nothing stood out at 9:00 p.m. I started transcribing the incredibly dull events of the last five hours I kept worrying that I failed the test and that neuro cam would reject me which was totally irrational of course as I didn't even know exactly why I was doing this in the first place I was honest in my account of the events that transpired although I considered embellish the facts to impress them with my creativity I took a picture of the perfectly cooked steak I had for dinner and the resulting mountain of dirty dishes to represent the best and worst things of my day not particularly imaginative I know I emailed off the report to mr. Hastings and felt torn between resentment for being manipulated into the situation in the first place and gratitude for examining a small slice of my own life in more detail I laughed at the idea that someone at neural cam headquarters sitting down and reading such a boring diary I wondered if they had thousands of people all over the world doing exactly the same thing over the next week I sporadically googled neuro cam to no avail I found it incredible that a super sight billboard linking to a website with presumably high traffic would generate no web presence whatsoever this further fueled my paranoia that this was a unique experience set up for my own benefit which I knew was in a surd and highly improbable idea I patiently waited for the response to my perception assessment assignment finally one week to the hour things took a turn for even more bizarre when I received an email from mr. Hastings who had another task for me here our individual author notes that at this point they were becoming paranoid and to a certain degree they felt manipulated and yes they were being manipulated by their own curiosity what's interesting and note as well is that while one might assume that each individual task was cookie-cutter everyone did not actually go through the same tasks but let's get back to our protagonist on this blog dear applicant to conclude neuro cams application process all applicants are required to complete the following assignment assignment neuro cam identifier covert delivery NCI 3001 /o two part a mission the successful cover and secure collection of standardized neuro cam identifiers the secure transfer will be executed as follows deviation from operational protocol as outlined will result in instant termination of your involvement with neuro cam part 1 travel to the secure transfer location refer to the map provided part 2 at this location carefully camouflaged there is an electronic safe using the map provided locate the safe part three carefully remove the camouflage I don't know why it skip part 4 part 5 enter the code 159 a to open the safe part 6 take only the package with your operative ID written on it part 7 re secure the safe part 8 or place camouflage in such a way to ensure that neuro cams property remains unable to be easily located by non neuro cam personnel part 9 vacate the area part 10 once in a secure location open the package Part C this assignment must be successfully completed by this certain date Part D operational security the Operations Division appreciates that attendance at a remote local primarily on correspondence and data gathered via telecommunications is known to raise risk profile issues with respect to urban environment factors to address potential concerns of operational personnel in this instance permission is granted to invite a person of your choice to accompany you while executing this mission your judgement in this case is being trusted and of course judged should you elect to do so choose a companion that will be trusted to not disclose any other party neural cams operational protocol and proprietary industrial practices please be aware for the purpose of additional security and quality control you may be monitored throughout the completion of this assignment neural cam International is aware that many operatives are tempted to publicly discuss and relate their neuro cam experiences via online forums web journals and the media operatives are strictly not permitted to disclose the details of operational assignments under any circumstances any operatives in breach of this protocol will be immediately terminated regards Charles Hastings on this blog post this guy actually documents himself going to this location many people probably wouldn't be comfortable travelling to an unknown location at this point for good reason having to retrieve something from a mysterious safe from an unknown party for unknown reasons sounds like a terrible idea at this point this seems ripe for some type of crime keep in mind no information was readily available on Google for this and someone venturing off at this point was completely taking a leap of faith into the dark as with all tasks this was paired with a deadline once again which meant that if someone wanted any idea of knowing what was going on here they had to comply in a timely manner or risk losing contact as I said previously our blogger among with many others did just that I will let his writing take over once again at about 6 p.m. on a balmy Tuesday evening I drove along a mountain and a road and parked at a community center opposite the car yard marked on the map i skirted around the car yard down an embankment and under a bridge that took me to a large concrete expanse leading to the red pillars the scale of them at such close range was impressive and it took me some time to walk way to the pillar at the far end apart from some kids and some skateboards off in the distance there was no one around I thought of neuro cams claimed that I might be monitored on this assignment and looked around for surveillance cameras nothing stood out once near the base of the pillar I had to climb up through the garden area which consisted of large grass tussocks among wood chips at the base of the pillar there was no sign of an electronic safe or a team of people with cameras hiding in the Disick's I stood there for a while feeling foolish thinking that this might after all have been someone's idea of a cruel joke I guess it was possible that the pranksters could have money to waste on such activities I was just about to leave when I noticed the wood chips at the base of the pillar that seemed slightly wrong in some sort of way I knelt down on the ground and dug a bit finding the edge of what felt like an old bit of carpet I tugged at it and lifted a squarish section of matting about 50 centimeters wide when I pulled it right back spilling the wood chips everywhere I saw an electronic safe set in the slab of concrete beneath it was the most surreal thing so unlikely but there it was still expecting the candid camera crew to come running out I entered the code I had been given into the hi-tech looking digital touchpad there was a small beeping sound and a click and a light flash from red to green I lifted the handle of the door and opened it upwards inside the surprisingly deep cavity was a pile of yellow envelopes stamped with narrow Cam's logo and hermetically sealed in clear plastic wrap each envelope had a handwritten name on it presumably operatives names there must have been about 100 in total I pulled them all out sorted through the intriguing names like tile ups midnight Eliana until I found one with my own operative name on it I was very tempted to open someone else's envelope but worried that I was being watched and this was strictly against narrow Cam's instructions following my orders I put all the envelopes back close the safe and replace the matting and wood chips I made my way back to my car without seeing anybody or anything unusual once inside my car which I considered a secure location I opened the envelope it contained a typed letter on kamme letterhead signed personally by neural cams mysterious CEO brigitte fisher along with a small orange badge with a strange logo resembling an all-seeing eye on it i read the letter dear operative welcome to neuro cam i am pleased to advise that i hereby offer you a position within neural cam international your perception assignment report was evaluated in accordance to our predetermined assessment criteria neural cams Human Resources and Security Division found that your report demonstrated a minimum of seven out of the 10 qualities desired by neuro cam international this rating determines that you will be an appropriate candidate for operational deployment

termination of your involvement with the organization congratulations on completing neuro cams application process I take great pleasure in being the first to welcome you to the neuro cam team regards Bridget Fischer CEO neuro cam international all right now we need to take a step back to get a good understanding of what is going on as it is really easy to get lost in these blog posts if you look at many of the operative blogs from 2005 and many of them joined in a similar fashion I will say that all the tasks are not identical though however past the recruitment phase the tasks seemed to change quite a bit the purpose of these tasks are what they're used for at the time was still completely unknown so what was this company recruiting for up until 2005/2006 this was all that was basically known about neuro cam many of the tasks seem very trivial I will note people speculated and argued among blogs but no one seemed to have a consistent answer the general gist and all it was known like I said was that this group would assign you tasks that buried on a wide scale for seemingly no reason as with most AR G's they usually have a start point and end point this one seemed a little bit different keep in mind that there was real money being synced into this thing so people figured that this group had to be making some kind of money on the back end but this just simply wasn't the case there were other neuro cam recruits that catalogued their stories with other recruits on their individual operative blogs like I said they would all link them together and it created a kind of social media feed amongst themselves this game seemed to foster a community that would for strangers to work collectively on things many recruits would join from a simpler task than get promoted and then would be given a new task that would in many cases involve the recruitment of more members these tasks would usually be about printing cards leaving photos that would have the neuro Kim logo on them and would link back to the website and would create a new cycle in which other new recruits would go through the exact same process at some point in the early years of this being on the internet people got sick of going through this individual cycle that was self perpetuated and started to look for more practical solutions to this mystery the name Robin Henley was passed around quite a bit as his name was found to be linked to the neuro cam website address many people believe this to be an individual alias however that was later disproven there were quite a few people in the community at the time who started to talk about who this guy was and they also found him linked to the Better Business Bureau with a business called neuro cam registered in 2000 here is a post from one of the many operative blogs that were dedicated to discussing neuro cam I meant to post as much earlier but things hectic one of the many questions swirling around neuro cam is the Robin Halley question it's the classic chicken and the egg whereas heli who is Robert Henley in the neuro cam is mind control projects as inspired reaction to the real neuro cam or as heli the creator of the whole shebang I don't have the answer to that like I have the answer to anything they're hope cam related but I do have this Robin Mark Kelly has been the sole proprietor of an Australian company neuro cam since September 6 2000 the New Zealand neuro cam if you recall wasn't formed until August 11th 2004 hmm there were two names that were passed around Robert Henley and Robin Halley Robert Henley ended up being an alias however Robin Henley was a performance artist basically Robin Henley's entire performance artist career is based on messin with people to some degree or deceiving them in some way looking into his older website which has now been removed showed various hidden camera videos and other forms of content most of which consisted of messing with people one of his acts involved a missing person act where he made himself disappear he would post missing photos or missing posters of himself and then would go walking around town blatantly and then would create a compilation of people calling in to say they have located him thus creating a timeline of where he was walking around that day this is interesting but the other thing is that still some people didn't understand why someone would go to all these lengths and spend so much money they would have to hire people to design the website and do all the tasks of this individual operation that was operating on quite a large scale yet there was still no money component to this at all if you recall those billboards cost about $10,000 in 2004 which isn't even adjusted for inflation even if we knew who was behind it all what's the reason for creating something like this Robin Hayley's name at this point was linked to neural cam in some way but people couldn't finally put the last piece of the puzzle together for a while not until much later in 2011 a documentary trailer was announced called WTF is neuro cam in which a reporter would come and take an objective look into uncovering what the entire thing was about weirdly enough though this was produced by Robin Halley himself so many people speculated that this is a way for him to make his money back or what was weird is I don't actually believe this individual documentary was sold anywhere or it made any money whatsoever because even though Robin Halley produced this thing what was weird is that I couldn't locate this film anywhere the clips that I used in the intro I believed to be from the individual documentary there are several clips that are floating around but not the entire thing which is 75 minutes long there's an IMDB page where there are acting credits and a full profile in the entire film and the trailer but that's about it this film clearly did not make any money nonetheless let's take a look at that film trailer do you see that sign up there could you tell me what do you think get out of your mind means and do you know what neuro cam is I don't know man maybe they finally made us legal or something I think Yura Kim could be some sort of brain camera maybe it began with a billboard then an innocent exploration through cyberspace soon Graham Hin stock found himself on secret assignment an agent of a shadowy organization [Music] what is neuro Camp what is it that's the 10 million dollar question if I knew that one thing that is clear is that neuro can get people to do things for them in the hopes of solving the mystery these assignments vary in nature and are often extremely dubious in terms of ethics and even the law yeah I'll pretend Iike you've probably already been noticed with this podcast yeah thanks tomorrow already paranoid enough you gotta mention that now on Stannis here so I thought you or someone I recognize I'm not so sorry okay I'll just go I'm sorry [Music] [Music] Trinity [Music] designs it worth the risk I'm just concerned and worried about you those freaking out living [ __ ] they're going yeah why are we doing [Music] we are still making this film are we so just to establish this lengthy timeline in 2004 neuro cams first billboards were spotted and this community had been building ever since and in 2011 it was announced that there would be an individual documentary produced by the guy who was likely the creator of it all however we never got that individual documentary released to the public so what exactly happened well we wouldn't get our answer until 2012 when Robin Halley got his ph.d project neuro cam an investigation is Robert Haley's PhD thesis it's 206 pages and leaves us with some incredibly fascinating looks into the situation at hand I will do my best to summarize but this is a lengthy read the thesis itself covers a wide variety of topics this includes but is not limited to the topic of creating project neuro cam the role of AR G's flash mobs hoaxes audience interactions secret societies and for reducing a 75 minute documentary exploring the whole fake world he had created these are just a few things that I picked out there's a lot more information here but just to note if this sounds confusing it's because it is one of the big takeaways I got from reading this interesting and metathesis is that this guy sought to create a work of fiction his documentary and wanted to see the results of audience interaction playing into the role of creating a fictional piece of artwork not only do we get to look into what it took to create project neuro cam we get to look at the entire story of what it would be like to be an operative that was written from our point of view part of his thesis is the story of how a person just like us would have gone down this individual rabbit hole keep in mind that this story that he writes from our perspective our actual operations that people would go through it's from an outsider's perspective and is based on real operations that actually took place the blog I was reading to you earlier while there are many others like it out on the Internet is actually written by Robin Halley himself and this exact piece of writing was also in his thesis if we pick up where we left off and we wanted to read through this entire thing on his thesis basically the process would have gone like this people would join neuro cam they would complete tasks in neuro cam they would go up the ranks recruiting new members and then the ultimate end goal would be to finally meet the creator of the entire project Robin Halley in which the protagonist which is us confronts Robin Halley scan him what it was all about so let me make this clear this guy made a fake organization to tell a fictional story based on true events and then at the end of this story he created a fake interview with himself all written from our point of view which is incredibly meta I must point out I do have to hand it to him though this is beyond creative especially at this point in time in 2004 people barely talked about a orgies let alone created one this meta and self perpetuating this one only required one billboard and then thereafter would get new recruits to consistently keep this thing alive for many years to come with these new recruits as well he was also able to offload much of the work thus creating a fully self-sustaining Arg another thing I wanted to point out is that at this point in time it's almost impossible to create something like this again because due to the age of the Internet at the time in 2004 many of the people involved in this weren't actually trying to solve the mystery they just wanted to be a part of this group Facebook still didn't have widespread adoption and many of these people being brought together from the internet was still a relatively new concept thus making this incredibly prolific at the time in conclusion I highly recommend that you go read through the entire thesis if you have the time it's a good read so if you want to go read about yourself as I said this story is written from your point of view going to the entire operations involved with neuro cam rising through the ranks and seeing all the things you would have to do I highly recommend you start on page 55 it is the initial blog post that we read through and builds off of that with all other subsequent missions and the full story is really really captivating I want to leave you with one more thing before we in this video at the time that this ended around 2012 something that a lot of people never really talked about is the fact that many people actually thought Robin Helly to be behind cicada while this has not been proven whatsoever I will say though that both cicada and neuro Cam are both secret societies looking to recruit individual members by doing tasks for them I will say that cicada is by far much more prolific in terms of the puzzles required however the basis and premise is the same and if the people behind cicada are not some huge organization it might be safe to assume that whoever created that individual Arg or puzzle was also taking influence from this individual neuro cam project I don't think we'll ever know for sure but it's still interesting to think about that being said this is barely sociable have a great night you",34:25
kqCNV2Xu6tI,gameranx,VideoGames,10 People Who Played ONE Game For YEARS Until It Paid Off,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqCNV2Xu6tI,2 years ago,5.4M views,VideoGames,"(digital tones) - [Falcon] In order to keep
up with the breakneck pace that games are released, a lot of us switch games fairly often. But what if you didn't? Hi folks, it's Falcon,
and today on Gameranx, ten people who played one game for years. Number ten, in the massively
multi-player online game Tibia, way back in 2005, there was
a door added to the game with the message ""You see a
gate of expertise for level 999. Only the worthy may pass."" And not to mention that
leveling in this game is apparently extremely tedious because there are very
large amounts of EXP that you need to get in between
levels in the higher levels, and dying can send you
back down certain levels. And it took nine years, but a player made it through the door. And that was a lot of work. Work that was done despite the
fact that developers had said there was nothing behind the door. And there was no guarantee that there would be
anything beyond the door. And yet a player by the name of Kharsek managed to get there, and then disappeared without saying anything. Yes, they made it through the
door, and then did nothing. They just stopped playing the game, they stopped posting to the Internet under any accounts that
they had, and that's it. That's all we know. Thanks, Kharsek. Number nine, a Reddit user
by the name of Liserius played Civilization II for ten years. They made a post on the /r/Gaming Reddit entitled 'I've been playing the same game of Civilization II for almost 10 years. This is the result.' Now, I'm not going to be able to read you this whole
post, it's fairly long. But I do want to point out some specifics. First, the world is a hellish nightmare of suffering and devastation. And yes, that is a direct quote. There are three superpowers in 3991 A.D., and there have been
dozens of nuclear wars. There's a front line where
all three superpowers meet in battle, but it is more
or less at a stalemate and has been for 2,000 years. Any attempt to advance
results in a nuking, and they obviously just retreat. In this version of the
world, the three nations- the Celts, the Vikings, and the Americans all reside on swampland because the icecaps have melted over 20 times, due to all of the nuclear wars. So not only is it swampland, it's irradiated swampland
that you cannot farm, both due to the fact that it
is swampland and irradiated. The military stalemate is so significant that all resources pretty much get funneled into tank building. Because, when you lose tanks,
they have to be replaced, otherwise the stalemate can't continue. However, you can create tanks at a rate that accounts for the loss of tanks. It just makes every city into a tiny town full of starving people. Yes, ten years of Civilization II. 'The world is a hellish nightmare of suffering and devastation.' A perfect quote. Number eight, a Mortal Kombat player who had the arcade versions of the games, and has been playing
them for over 20 years, found some secrets in
Mortal Kombat I, II, and III that haven't previously been found at all. Specifically, he found a menu
in all three of these games called The EJB Menu. EJB obviously standing for Edward J. Boon, or Ed Boon, the main Mortal Kombat guy. Now these menus feature
various interesting things, like the ability to see all
of the various fatalities in succession, which
obviously because of YouTube isn't that big of a deal
at this point in time. But way back when the games were designed, that would've been a big thing. That's kind of the
motherload, so to speak. In Mortal Kombat III,
there's also a mini-game, that's basically Space Invaders
but completely impossible. Also filled with those
goofy Ed Boon sounds. Number seven, back in 2011,
a YouTuber by the name of kurtjmac started trying to
walk towards the Far Lands, the area in Minecraft where
the game kind of just stops working correctly and generates
terrain that's bizarre. He has been walking in
Minecraft since 2011. Obviously not continuously, of course. But has been walking that long, and is about a quarter of the
way there as of last year. His most recent video was
not more than a few days ago, I don't know exactly how far he is, but as a 'let's play' series,
he's accrued over 730 episodes and has raised about $400,000 for Child's Play Charity doing this. Now keep in mind, newer
versions of Minecraft don't have a Far Lands. So he's still using an
older version of the game, and that's a very long way to go still. I can't imagine that after
going for seven years, last year, he's much further
than 25% of the way there, but it's interesting to
wonder if he'll ever make it. Number six, a lot of Minecraft servers are simply group-built projects where people contribute their time and knowledge of the
game to creating a world. Now, when you have a server
that has 1,500 people on it, that's open for about five years, and a lot of those people spend very large amounts of their
time doing the building, you get some pretty amazing results. As seen here on Minecraft
server The Shire. On this server, there's
so many different areas inspired by so many different realms of science fiction and real places. You could see urban architecture. You could see suburban architecture. You can find the Emerald City, as in from The Wizard of Oz, the Emerald City. Beautiful, Latin America-inspired cities with rivers for their transport system. Lots of different castles
that are huge and gorgeous. There's even an underwater city, not officially named Rapture, but apparently has been
done in the tradition of laissez-faire capitalism and
scientific abomination so, yeah, it's a reference to that. But perhaps the biggest accomplishment is that it's all connected
by a railway system. I don't know if you've
ever built a railway system in Minecraft, but even in creative mode, it's very time consuming. And this whole thing is
beautiful, and functional, and well done, The Shire. Number five, a Reddit user
by the name of salmondude had played Grand Theft Auto
III for over ten years. And he thought that he'd seen everything over the four platforms
he'd played the game on, but he found an Easter egg,
actually around five years ago, and shared it with other folks
on the /r/gaming subreddit. That Easter egg is, a
man that he shot dead holding a drawing that he had drawn, which, let's just call
crude and call it a day. If that's what you walk around
drawing on your free time, that when somebody mows
you down, somebody's like, 'oh, that guy's drawing weiners,' then you're probably an NPC
in Grand Theft Auto III. Number four, a lot of people
play EVE Online for many years, but this is something
that we wanted to share that we thought was interesting. It's kind of doing a specific thing in EVE Online for two years, which doesn't sound like
a long period of time compared to a lot of the people that we've already talked about, but considering they were just basically stalking another player,
the kind of dedication is- well, it's interesting. So, a few pirates in the game wanted to get a hold of a Ragnarok Titan. Which is a ship that's worth $3,000. Yes, American dollars. Actual, real Fiat money. Or at least was in 2014
when this happened. I don't know if it still is. So, this group really
wanted a Ragnarok Titan. And they were going to steal
it from a certain player that they had found who was
traveling around with one. The problem is, is that their logins were extremely intermittent. As such, it's kind of hard
to steal the Ragnarok Titan from the player who is not logged in, and therefore not occupying the world. What they did was to follow them around on alternate accounts, and kind
of try to predict his moves. When he would log in,
where he would log in, and if he would log in on the
big account with the big ship. When the player finally
did log in on that account, they promptly attacked
him, and in the chat log, happened to go ahead and
say, 'welcome back mate.' Number three, Halo
players tend to find rooms that are in cinematics
or part of the scenery that they really want. The rooms that you're not
supposed to be able to get into and what they want is
clearly to get into them. For instance, a group of players that were playing Halo Reach, there's some Banshee rooms in the hangar of the Long Night of Solace level, and they really wanted to get into it. The name of their group
was Termacious Trickocity, and I'm not going to sum
up the entire process, but they had to do a series of actions that involves flying into the hangar, triggering the map to overload until somebody spawns without a vehicle, activating a cut scene in a specific way, so on and so forth. And it took them five years, but they did, they got into it. Similarly, that same group,
Termacious Trickocity, spent ten years trying to get into an empty cage in Halo III. That process is really
interseting because it involves pushing a vehicle basically
to a certain point, and just sort of colliding
with geometry in strange ways. When asked why they do this, Termacious Trickocity said,
'cause it's a challenge.' And I have to agree with that reasoning. A challenge that's just
not intended to be there feels like the ultimate
challenge in some ways. Number two, when World
of Warcraft turned ten, Blizzard rewarded all of the players that had been there since the beginning, people who had played every year since the inception of Warcraft, by sending out a statue
to them of an orc that's- it's a pretty good statue. This was back in 2015, and
although there's not really a lot to say about it, it makes me wonder what
they're going to do if and when the game turns 20. Although I'm assuming it's
probably when more than if, and I cannot wait to see those statues. And finally, number
one, Reddit user gperk69 outed their grandma as
having played Wii Fit every single day for a full decade. We've actually covered this person before. There's a picture of her posing with her Wii avatar and saying
'this is your 3,949th day,' which is a lot of days. I can think of not a lot of things that I've done consistently
for ten years at all. So, wow. Wii Fit of all things. Have you played any one

MSpcdzwBatg,DramaAlert,Blog,"Logan Paul ROASTED by Dolan Twins! #DramaAlert RiceGum , PewDiePie , Jacksepticeye & Much More!",1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSpcdzwBatg,4 years ago,3.3M views,Blog,"sddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd[countdown]     killlllerrrr knomestarrrrr I'm your host Killer Keemstar lets get roooiight into the news. Yesterday here on Drama Alert, we told you about Logan Paul uploading a vlog of a dead body, someone that committed  suicide in suicide forest over in Japan. Now after that video aired... ...I do what I always do, tagging all the youtubers that made the news and well when Pewdiepie saw it He tweeted out this... ""Logan Paul goes to suicide forest woah we found a dead guy here so crazy let me just zoom in on this for the vlog! okay guys seriously leave a like if you're sad too"" and after PewDiePie made that tweet the whole world went off on logan paul causing daddy paul to be the number #1 trending name in the United States. Jacksepticeye tweeted out this; ""Logan Paul actually recorded a person who committed suicide in his vlog. What kind of fucked up mentality do you need to have to do something like that?! There is absolutely no defending it, by the way not joking or or exaggerating at all do not seek out the video if you’re at all sensitive to that stuff It’s very real. ""Aaron Paul from the breaking bad said this dear logan paul how dare you you disgust me i can't believe that so many young people look up to you so sad, hopefully this latest video woke them up you are pure trash plain and simple suicide is not a joke go rot in hell. Boogie2988 had this to say. Seriously, you know I don't like crapping on other youtubers, even when they deserve it but logan paul, how does it make you feel to know that you're making idubbz, keemstar, leafy and other edgy youtubers look like fucking disney content? do better, dude. seriously. First of all, uh, i don't think i make edgy content and who the hell is this leafy person you're talking about? but thats when the dolan twins fired off on logan paul. grayson tweeted out suicide is serious. people have lost loved ones, idols, heroes, fans to suicide Filming a video and mocking a victim is not raising suicide awareness. Laughing at the body of the poor deceased soul, I can't believe the disrespect of the victim their family and your YOUNG fans The other Dolan twin Ethan had this to say The horrible measures people will go to in order to have content to stay relevant is absolutely disgusting. Being blinded by your ego so much so that thinking it's okay to make insensitive remarks about suicide and broadcasting it for millions of children to see is sickening. That's when the Buddy Project, a non-profit movement to prevent suicide and self-harm publicly tweeted this... Logan Paul your recent video about the suicide forest is irresponsible and disrespectful, please take it down. If you want to raise awareness for suicide there are much better ways to do so then showing the dead body of someone who died by suicide. And ladies and gentlemen, there were a lot more celebrities a lot more youtubers talking about it like I said it was number one trending. The heat got so bad on Logan Paul that he ended up deleting the video. And he issued out this apology which just really pissed off people even more. Logan Paul said, where do I begin... Let's start with this, I'm sorry This is a first for me I've never faced criticism like this before Because I've never made a mistake like this before I'm surrounded by good people and believe I make good decisions I'm still a human being and I can be wrong. I didn't do it for the views, I get views - HUMBLE BRAG - I did it because I thought it could make a positive ripple on the internet not cause a monsoon of negativity. That's never the intention, I intended to raise awareness for suicide and suicide and suicide prevention and while I thought if this video saves one life, it'll be worth it I was misguided by shock and awe as portrayed in the video. I still am. Heh, okay, timeout you still filmed it, you still edited the video, you still uploaded it, you still titled it, you still made this fucking thumnail Logan, come on! However he's not done there with his apology, he goes on to say this, I do this sh*t every day, I make a 15 minute TV show every single day for the past 460 days - HUMBLE BRAG - one may understand it's easy to get caught up in the moment without fully weighing in the possible ramifications. I'm often reminded how big of a reach I truly have and with great power comes great responsibility - HUMBLE BRAG - For the first time in my life I'm regretful to say I handled that power incorrectly It won't happen again. I love everyone I believe in people, I'm out here, peace hashtag Logang for life an emoji and a hashtag in your apology *clap clap clap clap clap* *laughter* Okay so in case your confused this apology that Logan Paul posted out after he deleted the video made people even more mad. In fact the actress from Game of Thrones had this to say...You're an idiot you're not raising awareness, you're mocking. I can't believe how self-praising your apology is you don't deserve the success, views, you have, I pray to God you never have to experience anything like that man did. Amen Sonia Ricegum had this to say... No comment on the Logan Paul situation but lowkey after this he's still gonna get 5 million views per vlog and make 10 million dollars this year laughing out loud, laughing out loud, laughing out loud, and you know what that's pretty depressing but it's probably true. One of Logan Paul's fans had this to say, this is unbelievable so just prepare yourself for this, roll it So I'm a Japanese maverick I deserve to have a platform and the guy who died should be lucky to be in Logan Paul's vlogs, I'd do anything even that to be in Logan Paul's vlogs because you get recognised by a lot of people you know, millions of people and since I'm a maverick we do different things so even though a normal person would not film it we're mavericks so we film it anyway so *weird noises* Maverick style ah, the future is f***ed and Tanner Fox came out to support Logan Paul saying this...people will just look for anything to complain about, does it really affect anyone what Logan did. Not really, was it a bit messed up, yeah if you're bothered, don't watch the video there's thousands of dead body videos on the internet. Move on. Wow. What an idiot. Now a lot of people are upset at Youtube. There are a lot of people that are just pissed off at Youtube that there were no consequences for Logan's video, they're mad that his video was trending and not like flagged down, well somebody that works in the Youtube ""Hero Program"" that works with taking down bad content on Youtube, known as TrustedFlagger, tweeted out this remarkable information which I just find incredibly disgusting. He tweeted out this. Logan Paul's video was reported and Youtube manually reviewed it, they decided to leave it up without even an age restriction people have re uploaded it since and have strikes for graphic content and then he shows his screenshot where it was flagged and reviewed by Youtube. And again, after it was flagged and manually reviewed by Youtube, they put it on the trending page ok it was on the trending page, and I'm sorry I gotta call Youtube out here, because Pewdiepie ended up making a joke about all this, not a joke about suicide but a joke about how stupid Logan Paul is and his video today was taken down now since Logan Paul did such a bad job apologising it was really just bragging about him getting views he had to make another apology and he uploaded this apology to Youtube. and again this is the number one trending video on Youtube Now I must say I understand why this apology video is trending, because everybody is talking about it, but as we all know no algorithm picks videos to be on trending people at Youtube pick the videos that are on trending and again this man is getting favouritism from youtube. This is Logan Paul's second apology. Roll it I've made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement and I don't expect to be forgiven, I'm simply here to apologise So what we came across that day in the woods was obviously unplanned and the reactions you saw on tape were raw, they were unfiltered Uh, none of us knew how to react or how to feel I should have never posted the video I should have put the cameras down and uhhhhh stopped recording what we were going through there's a lot of things I should have done differently but I didn't and for that, from the bottom of my heart, I am sorry I want to apologise to the internet I want to apologise to anyone whose seen the video, I wanna apologise to anyone who has been affected or touched by mental illness or depression or suicide but, most importantly, I wanna apologise to the victim and his family for my fans who are defending my actions please don't they do not deserve to be defended the goal with my content is always to entertain to push the boundaries to be all inclusive. in the world I live in I share in almost everything I do the intent is never to be heartless, cruel or malicious uh like I said I've made a huge mistake, I don't expect to be forgiven I'm just here to apologise, I'm ashamed of myself I'm disappointed in myself and I promise to be better I will be better, thank you Now I believe that that's a great apology, but is it genuine. Is it actually genuine because when he first apologised, it was all about a humble brag, this individual is a actor, he has a team of people around him as he said, so are these actual feelings of remorse or is this just another publicity stunt as I said before, it doesn't matter if celebrities and big youtubers call out the Paul brothers, call out Jake Paul or Logan Paul it doesn't matter if it gets                                           are coming out with another dramaalert at midnight, so look out for that drama alert nation now over 3 million over 3 million 200,000 Subscribers",13:06
15V0gUXUPko,ElectroBOOM,Science,Free Energy Devices Build and Science,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15V0gUXUPko,3 years ago,4.5M views,Science,"hi today I like to build a few free energy devices and prove them if you are one of my close to two million subscribers or viewers you already know that I'm a huge advocate for free energy and its role in saving us from fossil fuel which is just killing our planet there are tons of videos of people building these devices every day so let's just jump into building them and the science behind them but under one condition don't just watch this half way and leave as a believer or non-believer you have to watch this to the end to be able to make a solid conclusion especially since I'll announce the keysight scope giveaway at the end first off we see this man using a few magnets in his design and coiled some wire around the rod magnets between the two magnets there is enough energy created to turn on a fluorescent light wirelessly of course this is a simple concept we all know that magnets hold potential magnetic energy that we just need to convert into electric energy I don't have the exact same magnets but I think I can do better see I have two bigger magnets like these that are connected to a series of smaller magnets and so the field of the big magnet is focused through the rod magnet and the tiny magnets have alternating magnetic fields north south north south now I'm going to slide some coil on top of the rod magnets and as we know magnetic field passing through a coil creates electricity especially here that I have alternating magnetic fields amplified by the field coming from the big magnets the large alternating fields create large AC energy across the coil which doesn't have anywhere to go and so the unloaded voltage across the coil just Rises significantly with my setup one of these would be enough what the two would make a more uniform electric field at the center as I've shown in my previous videos a fluorescent light in proximity with high voltage starts to glow because very high voltage excites the mercury vapour in the bulb and creates light hello everybody in the next video we have a few wires wound and coil in a specific way to help capture the available electricity in the atmosphere when magnets inserted into the coil it focuses the captured energy enough to power a circuit of course we know there's around hundred volts of potential voltage in the atmosphere per a meter of distance from earth as stated in the great professor firemen's lectures in Cal Tech University with up to 400,000 volts from earth to the top of the atmosphere 100 volt per meter is huge all we need is a proper antenna like these to pick those floating charges to create a power source and again we have our alternating magnetic fields in the coil to start a resonance with the captured atmospheric energy to provide a strong AC voltage here I'm using a low power LED light because still the captured energy is not that huge and if I insert the magnets into the coils as soon as it starts resonating there we have a shining light now there are different ways to wind wires around magnets for the same result like in this video we have a different combination of windings and magnet form factor what as you see in most cases we need a pair of magnets to maximize their resonance here I kind of did the same thing to big magnet piles on both sides of a bunch of tiny alternative magnets and a coil around them and if I'm careful not to shock myself I should be able to turn it on there you go another method is to also add the available acoustic energy in the air to the mix there is noise in the air so we might as well use it this guy uses a speaker and a coil around the base of the lamp to do this in a simple way I also put a coil around the base of my lamp connecting it to the contacts here I have a bigger speaker with a similar inductor or solder to its output of course the speaker has its own coil and magnet that creates electricity with the acoustic vibrations which is amplified by this additional inductor now like a step-up transformer the high-voltage energy from this primary coil is transferred to the secondary coil around the lamp if there are close enough and lamp turns on like this did you ever dream about having free electricity for the rest of your life here as many have done it we have the looping cables of the power bar generating energy it seems it is feeding energy into itself which is a wrong assumption when we have an extension cord like this looping it to itself we are getting an inductor if I zap the prong with the burst of energy I'm sending a very short pulse of current through the wire the current going through the loop generates a magnetic field with a direction that follows the right-hand rule and the field generated from one loop penetrates all the loops so like an autotransformer one loop of primary can generate much higher voltage on multiple loops of secondary and imagine the same current is running through every loop so each loop has the same effect on the entire coil which means much higher energy compared to the initial spark such that it can turn on a light and then of course we see some people like this kid being able to turn a lamp on from the energy generated through his body we already have animals in the wild that generate huge electricity like an electric eel we also know that our nerves and muscles work with electric impulses so a lot of electricity is constantly running through our body that is vital to our functionality like when you use your right hand it receives more electric pulses than your left hand and that creates some electric potential across your body now every one is different different skin conductivity stronger impulses ability to control muscles so with the right combination you could generate large enough potential to power something I have some of that capability of both I have to wet my skin to make it more conductive and shake my arm to pump some impulses there you go then I put it closer and last but not the least we have a computer fan with magnets glued on the blade and a bigger magnet close enough to push or pull the tiny magnets to rotate the blade and of course a turning motor generates electricity I have built a fan here and you can see that the streaming fields of the big magnet effect a smaller magnet and if I leave it in the right spot around here it starts turning and of course the turning motor is a generator and if I can figure out which wires are the output there you go I can turn on the lamp lies all lies there is no free energy they are all faculty it was all part of my scheme to lure the free energy believers here and show them the truth there is no free energy no crazy energy and no overunity free energy is energy generated without consuming any other source crazy energy which I just named it is energy from fake sources or sources that don't really have much power to deliver and overunity means these perpetual systems that have efficiency over 100 percent all impossible I was able to tell you convincing lies because I mix them with truth and facts so you would say oh I know that part is true so this guy must know what he's talking about and the rest could make sense too now I'm not trying to teach you how to lie I just want to show you how you can be lied to just trust me on this one there is no free energy no crazy energy and no overunity in our entire universe otherwise our universe would fall apart although I don't deny that in the future we might find a new source of energy let me show you how I did the tricks of course this magnet contraption doesn't work at all the reason my life is turning on is because I'm hiding my Tesla coil under the table Wow this is the source of the high voltage that's turning the lamp on not the magnets electric magnetic or gravity fields in a stationary object are stationary they don't move or stream out only when a magnet moves it sends waves of magnetic field through the universe that can create electricity through a coil so a stationary magnet with respect to coil doesn't create any electricity for all the other tricks I did here there is one common factor and that's a well hidden battery in my case the battery is in the land if you can see it here and the lamp turns on if i short its contacts this piece of junk three-fingered wire maze does nothing except for providing a short circuit with the magnets across the lamp contacts see the same kind of lamp is used in most loans paths of course there is huge potential energy in the massive atmosphere around Earth but there is no measurable localized energy in a tiny air space to power anything and here the guy seems to have no battery and turning a single LED on but this time if you see here he is running wires through his hand powering the LED that little liar and this piece of junk is the same thing just shorting across the lamp contacts turning it on and in this one of course there is acoustic energy in the air but even a single led needs way more power than whatever acoustic noise can provide so how does it work here on the winding I have something called a reed switch it's a type of switch that closes when it's exposed to magnetic fields and it just shorts across the lamp contacts when I bring the speaker magnet close the looping power bar is the most garbage of them all I don't think the guy did it the same as I did I have my battery in the lamp and I've shorted across the prongs with a piece of wire but I think the guy has his batteries hidden in the power bar itself something like what photonic induction did with his poverty were powering a light and a mixer from a cure and then how about generating electricity through my body to power a lamp that's impossible I'm just shorting across the lamp contacts through my body the same as what the kid was doing and for the fan I just have some coin cell batteries back here that turn on the fan through the read switch here when I bring the magnet closed and these are not even real magnets there is just plastic beads and the lamp just turns on by these wires shorting the contacts they are all lies and faff I tell you instead of this garbage let me tell you a few of my favorite channels that provide good content although there are a lot of good ones out there that I don't know if you want electronics well watch me or watch our beloved German engineer Great Scott or Dave Jones's eevblog or be Clive who breaks electronic products and explains them or great seemona Gertz who makes the robots oh and Jeremy Fielding and Fran Blanche - great electronic channels I recently learned about want to watch a lovable chemist and someone who inhales noble gases and extracts gold Cody's lab once mechanical engineering a ve is super knowledgeable in the field and has so many made-up words worthy of his own dictionary want a real superhero in special effects and graphics watch the debunk Man Captain disillusion one great backyard science and build watch the backyard scientist or the king of random or if you want

mBbOF8LVCj4,The Daily Show with Trevor Noah,News,Trump Takes India | The Daily Show,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBbOF8LVCj4,,7.4M views,News,"president Donald Trump still not used to saying that last night he flew 8,000 miles for his first state visit to India now Trump's in India partly to negotiate a trade deal and partly to get his copy of the Kama Sutra signed yeah Trump and Melania used that book all the time her favorite position is the one where she's on top and he's not in the room now you might be wondering how would a country full of brown people react to a visit from Donald Trump well it turns out from the moment Trump arrived it was love at first sight president Trump just arrived this morning for a two-day visit the president received what's being called a king's welcome orchestrated by the Indian Prime Minister the president headed a massive rally packed with more than a hundred thousand people a make America great again rally India style [Music] they even blasted macho man before the president took the stage and when he did a show of affection for India's Prime Minister the president is overwhelmingly popular here in India or his pro-business tough on terror image is widely admired I happen to like Prime Minister Modi a lot he says between the stadium and the airport we'll have about seven million people so it's going to be very exciting seven million people came out to see Trump go from the airport to the stadium that's impressive although to be fair it's also India there's seven million people between any two locations the line at Indian Starbucks is seven million people there are Indian Brides right now we're like no daddy I just want a small wedding no more than seven million people like okay Anushka first cousins only but it is true that Donald Trump is very popular in India all right some like him because of his anti-muslim rhetoric some like him because of his business savvy and all of them like him because his skin looks like tikka masala India is so fun Donald Trump they pulled out all the stops for his visits at India's famous Taj Mahal workers paint spruce and polish roads are renovated and nearby the Yamuna River rises as millions of liters of water of release to cover its foul polluted smell preparations included a hastily built wall that critics say was meant to block the view of a slum keeping thousands of poor people out of sight yeah India is trying so hard to impress Trump that they're building new roads cleaning up dams and even building a wall to hide their slums and you know Trump's gotta love that he's just like you see they built a wall and I haven't seen a single Mexican it works well now India cleaning its rivers and streets for Trump might seem extreme but if you think about it this is basically what guys do whenever a girl says she's coming over right yeah you make the bed pick up your clothes hide all your junk in the closet then she calls and says she can't make it and you like getting it so I flushed the toilet for nothing so clearly India is trying to give Trump a memorable experience there was however one tiny culture clash that Trump had to deal with Donald Trump is in India this morning but he could be forced to go without his favorite meals of burgers and steaks and his Prime Minister Narendra Modi a devout vegetarian plans not to serve any meat to the president during his visit one person who's familiar with president Trump's eating habits has told the media they're worried about how he'll cope with the lack of meat saying I have never seen him eat a vegetable I honestly don't know what's stranger the facts that Trump might eat vegetables or that people are actually worried about how it will go because you realize the news wasn't even snarky about it they weren't like haha the president has to eat vegetables they were like yo if Donald Trump eats broccoli he could die so this is gonna be hard on Trump and you know what I was thinking is what's worse for him is that cows are so sacred in India that they're allowed to just wander around in the city so can you imagine how hard that's gonna be for him he hasn't eaten beef for two days and then he's just gonna start seeing cows in the streets and he's gonna be like oh my god I'm hallucinating all the cows I've eaten have come back to heart me I'm sorry cows I'm sorry but I will say I'm impressed because despite the beef issue Trump is making the best of his India trip in fact he even made an effort to show the Indian people how much he respects them by trying to speak their language and it went about as well as you would think India welcomes us at the world's largest cricket stadium right here in a bad namaste chaiwalla Gujarat Sardar Patel ashram suChin Tendulkar Gujarat Goa Diwali as the great religious teacher Swami VV come on under what's out Oh even if that pronunciation was right that facial expression was so wrong that looked like the most exercise he's gotten in decades just like come come come all right that's my steps for the day I'm dying oh man now now this was really interesting after Trump butchered half of the Hindi dictionary Indian Twitter lost their minds right people were coming on like dude it's not namaste it's namaste who messes up No Mas this isn't a moose day but to those Indians I say please don't be mad right Trump may not be able to pronounce Hindi words but he can't pronounce English words either so he's an equal opportunity offender and besides think about it it would have been way scarier if Trump had come out all fluent in Hindi can you imagine if he just came on he's like cancer tumor a gel medium sepia after barber under a coach coach for TI Bigley so that was day 1 of president Trump's trip to India and you know what I'm proud of the present I'm really proud of him for teaching us a valuable lesson and that is no matter how old you are you can still go to new places make new friends and have new mind-blowing experiences like eating a carrot for the first time and to that I say namaste [Music] [Music] you",7:13

- Rolling. - [Narrator] How powerful is a kiss? Can it heal something that's broken or break something that's healed? Four ex-couples agreed to kiss on camera. This is their story. - Franca, this girl I met after a show. We dated for like seven months. - It was going well and then
I went back home to Germany. - When she came back, it just kinda like, kinda just lost touch a little bit. - I don't even know
what I want out of this. - I still kinda like her. - Maggie's my high school sweetheart. - Our families have been
friends for a really long time and we were friends all
throughout high school, we just started dating
end of my senior year. - And then she went off to college, which stopped our relationship. - We started this affair
around Valentine's Day. It was over a month
later because I was still involved with someone else. - We both know where we
stand with each other. - I have a hard time getting
out of relationships. - Alex is a very unique
person, I would say. - Dom is a little uptight. - The big thing was is that
she's kind of chronically basically late to everything. - He's also the type of person that was like very into coasters. We've had sex on this table, why can't a cup be on this table? - Hola. - Hey. - What's up? - Nada. - Cool. - Hello. (laughs) (laughs) - Ugh. - Hi. (gentle music) (laughs) (laughs) - Okay. - Good work. (laughs) - Oh my god. - That was hot. - Kiss was amazing, it was great. - Shut up.
- Phenomenal. - Shut up. - I didn't feel that feel. - Yeah, I'm just not. - We haven't talked in awhile but like, if you wanna hang out sometime. (laughs) - The kiss doesn't change anything. - It's still normal. - Yeah, no, like for this
moment, super strange, like once I leave, totally normal. - It's gonna be fine. - No that was just wildly personal. - Yep.
- Yeah. - Well that's what a kiss is. - You know the voice in
your head that's like, oh I should get back with
my ex, I really miss her, that voice is a lie. - I think we're on the same page. - Same chapter. - Same book. - She's a slow reader.
- I'm just a slow reader. (laughs) - Yeah there we go. - There's a good old place
where we can kiss again, deli food and a bench, make out with a pepperjack turkey in my mouth, whatever you want, it's just like. - You're not set on the turkey? - No no no.
- You're flexible. - Yeah.
- Cool. - Jinx. - I think everyone should stay friends 'cause we're really good friends and we have an awesome relationship now so if you can stay friends, do it. - I'll call you sometime?

K4rCzA8fS84,LEMMiNO,Informative,Simulated Reality,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4rCzA8fS84,5 years ago,5.3M views,Informative,"Have you ever seen The Matrix? Chances are
that you have, it's a rather popular film. In one particular sequence the protagonist
Neo is presented with a conundrum. The red pill or the blue pill. A choice between learning
the absolute truth behind reality and the blissful ignorance of illusion. Neo eventually
decides to take the red pill and does indeed learn the truth, as horrifying as it may be.
He learns that he's been living inside a simulation this whole time and he is now finally experiencing
true reality. At least that is what you, the viewer, is led to believe. But an aspect that
is somewhat dismissed is that the red pill doesn't grant you knowledge of reality as
much as it completely eradicates any distinction between real and fake. Let me ask you this.
When watching the movie, did you ever question if the supposed true reality that Morpheus
and the gang exist within is actually true reality? What's to say that they are not inside
a simulation themselves? I mean, up until this point, The Matrix was just as real as
this newfound reality. If anything, The Matrix only proves that knowing what reality is and
is not is an impossibility. And this could potentially go on for infinity. Never reaching
any sort of true actual reality if that even exists. Just a simulation within a simulation
within a simulation within a simulation... Yeah, and so on, and so on,
and so on, and so on... This video is not really about The Matrix
per se, but it's hopefully a digestible introduction to the profound and intricate
topic of this video. The idea that the universe and reality itself
could be a simulation is not something new. We can trace similar ideas as far back as the time
of ancient Greece when numerous philosophers, around the world, alluded to the idea that
reality could be an illusion. Chinese philosopher Zhuang Zhou compared his own existence to
that of a dream in which he believed himself to be a butterfly. He questioned the distinction
between reality and a dream if both could seem equally real. Another example is Plato's
Allegory of the Cave. The first part goes like this. Imagine a cave where people have been imprisoned
since birth. They are chained in such a way that they are forced to constantly gaze upon
the wall in front of them. They cannot look around the cave, at each other, nor at themselves.
All they know is this wall and nothing else. Behind them there's a fire, and between the
prisoners and the fire, there's a walkway. When people walk between the fire and the
prisoners, shadows are cast upon the wall. Because the prisoners doesn't know anything
else, they believe the shadows to be real. Actual entities of their own. And when a passerby
is talking, the prisoners believe it to be coming from the shadows themselves. They have
no idea that the shadows on the wall are merely lesser copies of reality and
falsely assume that this partial reality that they can
perceive is the complete truth. There are many interpretations of this allegory
which can by applied to vast range of topics. It can be interpreted as a way of understanding
the importance of knowledge and how it shapes reality or it could be an analogy for human
ignorance and our unwillingness to seek truth and wisdom.
It could also be read like this. Just like the shadows in this cave, could our
perceived reality be a shadow of something else? In physics and cosmology there's now a subfield
called digital physics which is a collection of theoretical perspectives based on the premise
that the universe is describable by information and as such is computable. And some of these
physicists around the world are actually trying to find out if our universe could be a simulation.
Commonly referred to as the Simulation Hypothesis. This is done by, in various ways, comparing
the real world against our own technology. If certain similarities are found, conclusions
can be drawn. One such study titled Constraints on the Universe as a Numerical Simulation
concludes that it is possible. A really simple analogy is to think of the pixels on your
screen that make up this video right now. When I move this red dot across the screen,
we perceive it as a smooth sliding action. But we know for a fact that this is an illusion
caused by the limitations of our sight. Nothing is really moving it's just bits of information
being modified in such a way that, from our perspective, it's perceived as motion. If
we zoom in and slow down, we notice that the red dot isn't sliding as much as it snaps
to each individual pixel. And this is essentially what they have observed, that the universe
has a finite resolution, or an underlying lattice as they call it. This could mean that
the universe and reality is not made out of energy or matter but is instead made
out of quantized bits of information that, from our perspective,
is perceived as energy and matter. Another way to imagine a computational universe
is using what's known as a cellular automaton. A cellular automaton consists of a grid of
cells. In this case, each cell can either be populated or unpopulated. We then need
to specify a set of instructions so that the state of each cell evolves over time based
on the state of neighboring cells. It may sound complicated but it really isn't. Let's
start with something simple. For example, we could say that each unpopulated cell will
become populated if a populated neighbor is found to the left. We then populate a single
cell and execute the program. What happens is that for each increment of time a new cell
is populated to the right of every populated cell. So in this case, it just continues to
the right forever. Not very interesting. Let's make it a bit more complicated
by using the instructions of a popular cellular automata known as 
The Game of Life. These are the rules: #1. Each populated cell with either one or
no neighbors becomes unpopulated. #2. Each populated cell with four or more
neighbors also becomes unpopulated. #3. Each populated cell with two or three
neighbors remains populated. #4. Each unpopulated cell with three populated
neighbors becomes populated. We populate as many cells as we'd like and
then press play. The resulting behavior is actually quite remarkable. I mean it's not
GTA V or anything but still. What's remarkable is that these four simple instructions can
over time produce incredible complexity. Cells can live, die, or multiply and create a sea
of seemingly chaotic randomness. Some configurations stop immediately while others seem to continue
forever. And there is no guaranteed way of telling if any specific configuration is eventually
going to stop or continue indefinitely. If we zoom out as the model continues to expand,
increasingly complex patterns begins to emerge. But not only patterns. Over time even the
behavior changes. The interactions between individual cells is overshadowed by the behavior
between entire blocks of cells. And this is the idea. That the universe began as something
incredibly simplistic like a grid of cells governed by a few simple instructions. But given enough time
it evolved into something incredibly complex. It's only natural for us to assume that the
complexity of the universe must be very complicated. The world can often seem very confusing, random,
unpredictable, and even unexplainable. What The Game of Life quite elegantly illustrates is that
complexity can actually be the result of simplicity. If you, and I, and everything around us is
the result of computable information, it stands to reason that that information can be modified
and manipulated to an endless extent. We would be nothing more
than puppets in a theater. Maybe the simulation began seconds ago and
we only think it's been 13.9 billion years because that information was artificially
included upon its creation. Maybe the universe is really really tiny and all distant celestial
bodies are simplistic renditions to create the illusion of enormity. Maybe nothing physically
exists until we observe its existence. Perhaps detail and complexity is added when it's needed
instead of being constant and absolute. Perhaps discovering that this is all a simulation
is part of the simulation. Perhaps this isn't the first iteration of the universe and someone
could be pressing the off switch right n- Don't get me wrong. All of
what I just said is absolutely insane. But that's kind of my point. If we accept the simulation hypothesis,
we also accept that literally anything is possible and that nothing can be determined.
Imagine that we somehow found definitive proof. So for the sake of argument, let's say we escaped the
simulation. Then I think we could all agree that we would know that it's a simulation, right? But we
still wouldn't know if our escape from the simulation was simulated in and of itself.
In other words, we could still be inside the simulation. It's a so called infinite regress
issue which means that any evidence we find or knowledge that we obtain could just as
well be simulated in and of itself. Including any evidence
that it's not a simulation. As the extent of the illusion cannot be
determined, nothing can be determined. In the first draft of this script I addressed
many radical ideas surrounding the simulation hypothesis. But as it can all be nullified
by the asking: ""What if it's part of the simulation?"". It's really not that interesting. There's
little, if any, scientific value here. It's mostly philosophical and metaphysical.
And it's all very analogous to the limited reality of the
prisoners in the cave. So let's change our perspective. Instead of
assuming the position of the prisoners in the cave, could we be the ones who ignite
the fire to cast shadows upon the wall? A big reason why ideas related to simulating
reality has become so popular in mainstream media, like movies and video games, is that
on the surface it seems very plausible. If we look at what we could do just a few decades
ago and compare it to modern technology, it's easy to imagine a future wherein technology
has advanced far enough that it's indistinguishable from reality itself. And while there's nothing that
explicitly prevents that from happening in the future, there are definitely
limitations to what we can and cannot do. Over the past half-century the processing
power of computers has doubled every two years which is an observation known as Moore's Law.
But this growth won't continue forever. In fact it's already begun to slow down. It's
now closer to two and a half or even three years. The reason for this decline is due
to the physical limits of computation. Computers are fantastical and can do incredible things
but they are not magical. The speed at which they process information and the amount of
information they can process is, like everything else, governed by the laws of physics. For
example we will never, regardless of any potential futuristic technology, be able to
accurately replicate anything down to every single molecule,
atom, and fundamental particle. And the strange world of quantum mechanics
is to blame. There are many reasons why quantum mechanics makes this impossible but
one great example is the uncertainty principle. It states that the more precisely the position
of a particle is determined, the less precisely the momentum of that particle can be determined
and vice versa. You can think of this as a balancing board. We force the left side down
to increase precision in measuring the position of a particle, but in doing so, the right
side has to go up and thus we loose precision in measuring the momentum of the particle.
To be certain about both properties at the same time would require us to break the board,
or in this case, break the laws of physics. The uncertain and probabilistic nature of
the universe makes exact replication an impossibility. So let's forget about any notion of exact
replication. It just isn't, dare I say, realistic. What we can do instead is mimic reality by
approximation. Take a look at this. This is The Illustris Project. A giant cosmological
simulation with the aim of studying the formation and evolution of galaxies. It's an ongoing
project in which scientists use the most precise data and calculations currently available
to create the most precise model of the universe possible. At its highest resolution it had a volume of
106.5 Mpc³, took several months to complete on a supercomputer with 8192 cores, used 25 TB of RAM
at its peak, and had a particle count of over 18 billion. Of course, it's only realistic to a certain 
extent and from a very narrow perspective. The simulation is detailed
enough that they can actually zoom in on individual galaxies, but it's not
detailed enough to simulate the birth of each individual star or planet. And certainly not
the astronomical numbers of individual molecules, and atoms, and so on. Instead they have to approximate
how a galaxy behaves as a whole without actually simulating all of it's individual parts and
properties. And once the simulation arrived at present day, the result was strikingly
similar to what we observe in the universe. And by constantly tweaking
these approximations increasingly realistic results can be achieved. Never quite
reaching true realism but hopefully realistic enough. This is all well and good for all scientific
endeavors. Things like astrophysics, particle physics, meteorology, fluid mechanics, medicine,
evolutionary biology, and the list goes on and on. But what about creating a simulation
for entertainment purposes? So far I've only talked about simulations
as self contained systems. You write some code, press execute, and hope for the best.
But wouldn't it be far more interesting to create simulations that we can not only interact
with but also experience to the point of complete immersion. Software like video games are great
examples of interactive simulations and hardware like the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive are
some of the most immersive technologies available to the public. Well they will be soon at least.
Of course, these are only aimed at stimulating the audio-visual senses. What about everything
else? Like touch for example. Well, there's full body suits like the Teslasuit, vests
like the KOR-FX, and gloves like the Hands Omni. These will give the illusion of actually
holding virtual objects, getting hit by bullets, and possibly even give the sensation of temperature.
Then there's also entire systems built to create a virtual experience, usually designed
according to a specific game or game type. There's driving and racing simulators, flight simulators,
railway simulators, etc. If you want to navigate inside a virtual environment, your best option at the
moment is something like the Virtuix Omni. All of these technologies are fantastic but
they are not ideal. They are only the beginning of the virtual reality revolution that likely
waits ahead. They are the monochromatic TV's before color. Because the limitations of these
devices stems from their implementation. You're always going to be aware that you're wearing
a head mounted display or that you're strapped into a locomotion platform. What's eventually
going to replace these mediating technologies to create a truly immersive experience are
BCIs. Brain-computer interfaces. Research on BCIs began in the 1970s and since
then the technology has come a long way. So far the focus has mostly been on repairing
cognitive and sensory-motor functions. As an example neuroprosthetics are prosthetic
limbs that can be controlled by a persons brain. People who's lost an arm and hand can
now get a robotic prostheses that they can control using sensors implanted in their brain.
BCIs can also be used to allow paraplegics to walk again and help people with many types
of paralysis. From an entertainment perspective, you can truly see its potential when combined
with virtual reality. The Emotiv EPOC is a publicly available BCI that you can actually
use to play games with your mind. I mean, it's not perfect, it's actually far from perfect
but come on. You just cannot complain when someone has quite literally invented mind
control. And better yet in 2014, the first brain-to-brain communication was achieved
between two people via the internet. In other words, telepathy
is now becoming a reality. But we're still missing a crucial aspect.
That is CBI technology. A computer-brain interface. And this is a significantly more difficult
obstacle to overcome. In a typical brain-to-computer interface, a device receives information from
the brain and tries to interpret what that information means. The worst that could happen is that
the computer gets it wrong. In a computer-to-brain interface, the brain receives information
from a device and the worst that could happen is that you actually damage the brain of the
user. In 2002, a blind man had a device implanted onto the visual cortex of his brain which
was in turn connected to a camera. This allowed him to partially regain his vision. The camera
sent its signals to the visual cortex of his brain and his brain interpreted these signals
as if they actually came from his eyes. Another example of a CBI was used on monkeys. A monkey
would control a virtual arm to touch one of several visually identical objects. When the
virtual arm touched one of the objects a signal would be sent back to the brain of the monkey
to stimulate the sensation of touch, describing the fine texture an
object that didn't actually exist. But there's definitely a greater risk at play
here and it's gonna take a while until we perfect such technology.
But once we've unlocked the mysteries of the brain, the possibilities
will be virtually endless. If this technology continues to advance and
is able to entirely escape the realm of science fiction, the world as we know it and the future
we often imagine, will dramatically change. When we try to imagine the distant future,
we often think of humanity as these grand explorers of the universe. It's often just
assumed that we will continue to expand outwards far beyond the Earth and the Solar System.
Of course, this is under the optimistic assumption that no apocalyptic events takes place and
that we steadily continue to progress and innovate. Almost every non-apocalyptic futuristic
science fiction tale describes humanity as a species that will expand outwards. And maybe
that's true. But when this technology turns into reality, why would you want to? A powerful
virtual reality could allow us to do anything and everything. No fear of harm or death,
no irreversible consequences for your actions, no physical limitations. The ability to customize
and manipulate the world around us to fit our personal needs and preferences. Just like
in a dream, maybe it's possible to manipulate the brain's sense of time. Real world minutes
could turn into virtual years. Could that be why the universe can seem so lifeless even
though it's been around for such a long time? Perhaps every civilization that reaches a
certain technological maturity realizes that expanding outwards to explore
the universe is pointless when expanding inwards, using technology,
allows you to do so much more. I've never made a video like this before.
A video heavy on speculation and even touching on some philosophical questions. Hopefully
you don't think I've gone completely insane. It's so difficult to make a video about these
topics without sounding like you have some sort of religious faith in The Matrix, waiting
for Morpheus to come down from the heavens. It's far fetched, highly speculative, and
mostly just fun to think about.",23:16

is not Hollywood. We're not going to use
any computer graphics. We haven't made any mechanical alterations
to the car... at all. We just picked it up from the farmyard
and brought it here. Dearie me. That was a bit uncomfortable. It damaged my spine quite badly
doing this. And then it set about damaging Bristol. This didn't really hurt it either. Yeah, battery's good.
Radiator's good. That'll buff out. That's got it. So, we left the city centre
and went to the seaside. I'd tried careless driving. So I thought
I'd try a spot of careless parking. Look what's happened! This is the Severn estuary, home to
the second biggest tide in the world. Forty feet
and it moves at eight miles an hour. That's why the RNLI
have tethered my car in place. I'm not going to get that out for hours! Damn! The lifeboat men and locals
thought it was a huge laugh. -So, that's going to drown my car.
-Oh, yes. -When will I be able to get it out again?
-A few hours. Windscreen's still in. But then disaster. The ropes tying it down had snapped. -It could be out in the main channel.
-You may never see it again. I don't think you've quite got this.
We've got to get it back. Very kindly they waded out
to see if they could find it. But it had gone. And it didn't turn up until the tide
had gone out five hours later. Come on! Come on! The silt had jammed the steering lock and the cylinders were flooded
with seawater. It was a wreck and though
we'd brought a mechanic along, we had no spare parts. Things looked bleak. Well, the mechanic has worked
on it now for 40 minutes or so, I think. And it's not looking good. It seems, then, that if you want
to kill one of these things, the beach, the sea, salt water,
is the answer. Sorry. Wrong. Astonishingly, the Toyota was not dead. I do not believe it! Right, it's started. Now, let's see if it moves. So, it had survived the West Country,
but would it survive our test track? The problem is, what can we do here
that we haven't already tried? Difficult one. I mean, the only solid structure
we have here is this, the Top Gear production office. And that won't stop it. The Americans have used Daisy Cutters
on these things to no avail. But I've got something much more powerful. The Mistral GT. What do you have to do to kill one? Right. A bit undignified, but here we go. Lordy lord! I'm too old for this. I honestly can't believe this.
The steering's fine. The gearbox is fine, The low range box is fine.
The brakes are fine. Even the speedo's
telling me we're doing 30. To give you an idea
of just how strong this car still is... look what we've got here. It's used to fell skyscrapers, but look what happens
when you thump it into the car. Well, the day Thou gavest, Lord, is ended. But, sadly, the car isn't. It's survived trial by water, It's survived trial by Bristol
and trial by caravan. But now it must face
the most difficult trial of them all. Trial by fire. That was phenomenal. -I know. Amazing.
-Be honest. -Did you really not change any bits?
-Not a thing, other than the windscreen. We had to put a new one in
for driving through our production office, otherwise it would've taken my head off.
So, we put a new piece of Perspex in. That was it. Other than that, nothing.
We just had hammers, spanners and a bit of WD-40
to get the engine going after the sea. All of which makes it more of a shame
that in the end, you killed it with fire. -That was churlish.

throttle house i'm thomas and i'm james and we're at the throttle house test track for a drag race [Music] look at that what happens when you take the heart of a hellcat mix it with the soul of a dinosaur king and put it in a truck you get this the horsepower ram trx spec today to 118 000 canadian it is the most powerful truck you can buy off the dealership shelf and therefore de facto it reigns supreme or you can listen to your inner serpent and for similar dying get this forbidden fruit the super snake sport an f-150 turned supercharged monster by shelby american 770 horsepower shelby suspension a baller exhaust bigger brakes and special custom insides more special still because this one is number zero zero one okay the ram t-rex as i'm calling it because trx is not nearly cool enough of a name he might have a whole lot of horsepower and probably less weight but i have some math on the underside of my compartment here because sohcahtoa and i also have launch control and a really really nice interior okay no this doesn't have the nicest interior or build quality but it has been put on earth to do one thing drink trx tears okay this thing is a beast hellcat engine under the hood just crap tons of power actually speaking of a hellcat engine we teamed up with omaze to give away a dodge demon in celebration of high horsepower truck races and twenty thousand dollars we'll talk about it more at the end but all you need to know right now is go to omaze.com challenger to enter and the best part is all of your entries go towards helping a great cause all right time to stomp on a snake let's do this that's the wrong let's do this oh god that's so close i'm taking it now i'm taking it now oh my god oh my god i didn't even break talk because i can't the power overpowers the breaks yeah you have tiny little bricks you see how you doing a roll oh that's a good time that's a good time this is fun i know it's been it's been a very difficult year and like to be able to do days like this even in december it's so great like thank you guys subscribers or not the fact that you come out and watch this and then we can do this stuff it's amazing and hopefully in a very strange year it's been fun for you as well time for a roll race [Music] and go oh come on bye bye oh my god he's bleeding that's wavy that's cute that's cute oh my gosh this sounds like a freight train [Music] that thing's just got so much top end it is a freight train that's what happens when you stick a giant blue supercharger onto a v8 oh my god the brakes on this truck are so good you can smell them though here's a fun factoid did you know that each car brand has its own smell when it's new and it gets really hot this is the fca smell i'm getting right now is that your concession speech yeah but yeah that's really really expected actually based on what happened beforehand you've got a bit of smoke coming out yours i do yep oh yeah my brakes are on fire okay gonna go cool down bye as i said put on earth for one thing to drink the tears of a trx can't even handle it it can't even handle it don't look at the interior of this don't okay i have cooled my brakes okay and i'm going to go do a hot lap in this yeah a hot lap yeah i think this is going to be the fastest vehicle we've ever had around this track all track yeah our track the truck yeah the track that we've had bac monos on and gt500s okay here we go come on fastest lap time i'm feeling it oh this truck is unbelievable it turned out it's understeer but then no eyes underneath okay yes come on all right going for the gt500 time that's my that's my feeling actually you know what baja mode yep i just gonna do that yeah that's that's gonna save some time right there for sure let's go over here huge crazy suspension travel on this thing really nuts it is the steering is actually quite good and the control over the body is pretty amazing and actually it's a you know i'm just going to cut across here too actually [Music] and uh 38 seconds 38 seconds 38 seconds fastest time yeah i just it just looked like you cheated a little bit what no i just i play into the wheelhouse of the car with my driving style you just you're upset that you lost yes you got beaten by a price-matched ford with a blower on it and there are moments when it feels like that's all the super snake sport is because aside from being ballistically fast for a truck it doesn't quite feel like it earns the full six-figure sum it commands beyond its sentimental value the trx on the other hand is the whole package and the difference is with its crazy racing suspension it could have done this race on any surface in the it's so stupid i want it category it takes the win for me yeah it's my choice as well but it's hard not to love the honesty of the super snake sport and the look and let's not forget it decimated the trx today for the price it may not have the build quality or interior features but it is a truck with unmatched pace a serpentine assassin of the strip and true to its mission lays waste to its rivals and doesn't look back okay want to win a demon who wouldn't all you have to do is go to omaze.com challenger to enter and you could win a brand new dodge demon and 20 000 but the best part is that your donations go towards supporting a great cause in this case helping the ronald reagan ucla medical center fund their mobile ecmo a life-saving mobile cardiac and respiratory support machine so go there donate good luck [Music] you're watching throttle heads i'm thomas and i'm james and

94ed4v_T6YM,PBS Space Time,Science,Is The Alcubierre Warp Drive Possible? | Space Time | PBS Digital Studios,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ed4v_T6YM,6 years ago,2.4M views,Science,"  Rumor has it NASA
is actually working on a real faster than
light warp drive. So when do we get
our first starship?   Faster than light travel is
a staple of science fiction. Star Trek warp drives
zip around the galaxy at hundreds of times
the speed of light. But traveling at the
real cosmic speed limit of 1 times
the speed of light would make for some
pretty dull sci-fi. It would have taken
Han Solo 40 years to make the Kessel
Run in 12 parsecs, traveling at only light speed. It's understandable that both
physicists and sci-fi fans was so inspired by
the idea that he decided that the Star Trek warp
drive should become a reality. In fact, he was inspired by
Gene Roddenberry's choice of the word ""warp."" Alcubierre constructed
a warp field in the mathematical language
of Einstein's theory of general relativity,
a real solution to the equations of
GR that would actually allow faster than light travel. Yep, pretty much the
ultimate in fan fiction. But is it actually fiction? NASA doesn't seem to think so. It's Eagleworks
Laboratories is actually trying to produce and
detect warp fields. More on that later. But if NASA's researching
it, it must be legit, right? So when are we going to be
warping around the galaxy? Let's break this idea apart. First, it's important to
note that this idea does not contradict the principle
of a cosmic speed limit. That limit, the speed
of light, refers to things-- mass,
energy, information-- traveling through space. However, according to
general relativity, there's no limit on the relative
speeds of two separate patches of spacetime. For example, as we talk
about in this episode, the expansion of
the universe means that very distant
galaxies are moving apart from each other
faster than light, even if the galaxies
are relatively still in their local
frames of reference. Also, below the event
horizon of a black hole, spacetime cascades towards
the central singularity faster than light, carrying
light, matter, monkeys, and everything else with it. Now, the spacetime around
and within a black hole is predicted by solving
Einstein's field equations around a point of extreme
positive energy density. Basically, mass and energy
tell us how space should warp. But if you're cheeky, you
can actually just make up a solution to the
equations of GR without starting with a real
mass/energy distribution. That's what Alcubierre did. He developed a spacetime
description, a metric tensor, that describes a volume of
nice, flat spacetime enclosed in a bubble of
extreme curvature, a pinching or warping of
spacetime in the surrounding shell that causes
space to expand behind and contract in
front of the bubble. As a result, the bubble is
pushed and pulled by spacetime itself, moving at
speeds only limited by the intensity of the warp. A starship inside the bubble
is carried along for the ride while feeling no
acceleration at all. It's sort of like building a
conveyor belt out of spacetime. You stand still with respect
to the conveyor belt, but the belt itself
moves faster than light. But is this even valid? Can you just make up a
spacetime description and then essentially solve
the Einstein equations backwards to figure
out what arrangement of matter and energy would
be needed to create it? It's sort of like
giving the answer before you have the question. So, 42. Yeah, sure you can do this. There's just no guarantee
that the resulting mass/energy distribution would be
physically meaningful. In fact, when you try to
do this for the warp field, you find that you
need to produce a ring of negative
energy density in a band around the ship to produce
the right warp bubble. That means our ship looks
something like this in order to produce a spacetime
curvature like this. Unfortunately, it
may not even be possible to make
negative energy densities on large enough scales. We can create something like
it, a negative pressure, on quantum scales
via Casimir effect. But on macroscopic
scales, you'd probably need some sort of exotic
negative mass matter, like element zero, which
is tricky, because there may be no such thing. There are other minor issues. Any FTL device
can, in principle, be used to make a time machine. Excellent! Except Stephen Hawking
chronology protection conjecture states that quantum
mechanics will always stop causality-breaking actions. It suggests that
there's something in the deeper union
of GR and quantum mechanics, the
theory of everything, that prohibits the warp drive. One possible quantum disaster
is that the extreme spacetime curvature of the
warp bubble walls would roast the interior
with crazy Hawking radiation. Does anyone else get the idea
that Stephen Hawking really doesn't want us to
build time machines? Suspicious. Here's another challenge. Assuming that you can even
make negative mass matter, to make a warp field,
some of it would need to go outside
the warp bubble, which means it gets left behind
when you go to warp speed. There are some proposed
solutions, one of which is to lay down the
external negative energy conditions along the path before
you leave, sort of like a warp highway. The first trip has to be
made at sub light speed. But I'm personally cool with the
awesomeness of warp highways. Last tricky thing--
as Alcubierre devised the warp
bubble, he figured it would take a lot
of negative energy. In fact, it would take
significantly more negative energy than there is
positive mass/energy in the entire
observable universe. Later refinements
brought this down to the mass
equivalent of Jupiter. Either way, not practical. Happily, recent reworkings
of the bubble geometry have cut this down further. Thicken the walls
of the warp field, and you get the negative
mass/energy requirement down to the equivalent of maybe
the moon or even an asteroid. Rapidly oscillate
the warp field, and you hypothetically
soften the fabric of space via higher
dimensional effects-- literally, a hyper
space warp drive. And this brings mass
needed down to kilograms. Given that we're just
making up solutions to the Einstein
equations, we could even shrink down the warp
bubble while expanding the internal volume,
Tardis style, which could get us down to
needing only milligrams of negative mass. If the bubble is small
enough, then we may not even need actual exotic matter. Quantum scale manipulation
of the vacuum energy a la the Casimir
effect may be enough. Check the description for the
sources of all of these ideas. Now, this sort of wild optimism
has inspired NASA's Eagleworks Laboratory to try an
experiment to create and detect a warp field. Now, this would be a field
created by positive, not negative, energy density. But baby steps, right? It uses a Michelson
interferometer, like a mini version
of the one being used to detect
gravitational waves, To measure the tiny changes in
path length created by a warp field. Now, some intriguing
results have been detected. But interpretation is
very, very challenging. So when are we going to be
warping around the galaxy? If it's even possible,
it'll take several centuries at a minimum. As I've argued before,
we'll reach the stars by sub light speed
starships long before that. Even the Kugelblitz engine,
the black hole drive, has fewer physics hurdles
than the warp drive. Honestly, I think it's going to
take an actively interstellar, or at least interplanetary,
human race to motivate the monumental advancements
needed to build the first warp drive. The good news is we're going
to need a ton of physicists to get to that point. Let's make it so on the next
episode of ""Space Time."" Last week, we talked
about gravitational waves, and whether the advanced
LIGO Observatory has maybe seen them. You guys had lots of
amazing questions, so let's get to them. Renato Grigoli and others asked,
what about the LISA Mission? LISA is amazing, although now
it's ELISA, the Evolved Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. It'll be an orbiting
gravitational wave observatory designed to detect much higher
frequency gravitational waves than advanced LIGO. And this should actually
allow it to detect binary star systems in our galaxy. The program is being developed
by the European Space Agency. NASA was originally
a part of it, but had to drop out
due to funding cuts. And so now, the original plan
is scaled back significantly. Now, that seems a
shame, doesn't it? The scheduled
launch date is 2034. psantochi asks if we have
any comments on the BICEP 2 experiment. OK. So this was the much hyped
gravitational wave detection based on polarization
anisotropies in the cosmic microwave
background radiation that came out earlier this year. Yeah. So now, the money is
on the signal actually being due to dust, not G waves. The lesson-- quadruple
check your quadrupole. This is why LIGO
won't say anything until at least the
end of the year. Now, MrSh1pman wants to know,
if we find these G waves, will it change anything? Can we build something
cool with them? Well, maybe. Quantum mechanics began
as an abstract musing on the nature of reality. And I doubt that Max Planck
and Schrodinger and Bohr imagined that this
crazy theory would lead to the invention
of the transistor, a quantum mechanical
device, let alone the computer, the
smartphone, the Apple Watch. Tenebrae wants our thoughts on
that amazing new Kepler Space Telescope result
that the media is hyping that there's an alien
megastructure eclipsing a distance star. Now, this is a stunning result.
But as we say on ""Space Time,"" it's never aliens. Check out the actual
signal that reveals this eclipsing material. Those dips are the drops
in the star's brightness from some stuff moving
in front of the star. It's dimmed by a crazy
20% at some points. Now, this is definitely not
a clean geometric structure. It looks like it has to be some
fragmented clumpy material, like the proposed
swarm of comets. That suggests a natural origin. Although I imagine it could
possibly be insanely vast ragtag colony of space
structures surrounding a parent planet== except
it's never aliens. Radio telescopes are
now pointed at it. So perhaps we'll
know pretty soon. To Un Disclosed,
I say, you laugh, but the first
evidence of alien life may be the
spectroscopic signature of biogenetic atmospheric
methane on another world. To Simon Martin, don't worry. They're holding me very gently.",10:00

list of favorites I like the day you next year but I also like the Volvo but I don't like it cos he confound it yeah that is really putting me off that I'll phone up the Volvo guys hello good chance that I won't have it what do you found out I found lots of goodies in here there are that's too good for this video I'll probably just keep all of them same for enough time oh they mate I see that you've got a Volvo a sail it's a blue estate for 249 pounds it's still available perfect if I were to come with 200 would that be okay for you ABS light is on the speedos not working so if I were to offer you 200 you'd be alright with that okay perfect thank you very much okay bye bye why did they have to go so smoothly I should have gone in 450 you should have come one next year that's the thing isn't it if if they don't pick up then the cars pretty much automatically out all right we'll go 306 diesel we end up doing this like four hours well that's good we've proven that you can buy a car and go to a beach and have a barbecue with your friend with your colleagues of your best mates I see that you've got a POJO 306 for sale on gumtree you still have it hello hello hello yes hello sorry two cars to potential 306 all the Volvo I kind of want the Volvo though I think we go look at I should get some miles the miles [Music] by then here we are back in miles with no air conditioning with only two windows that work it's just got 125 percent uptime it's gonna be tight oh god I really hope that this Volvo's got aircon if it does they won't work not for two hundred pounds I can't deal with me hopefully the mold will be right as long as it drives in a straight line and stops in a straight line although cars that stopping a straight line are overrated as we found out last video cool onwards date with destiny here we go no v40 hello he's there was the key and every sight oh god we need enough one of them right so a lovely guy called Salim is just giving me the key to the Volvo and there it is looks alright on first inspection isn't it I mean to be honest the challenge is to buy a car I'll take it to West Wittering I don't really need to look it over very much tonight just as long as it starts and drives keep going and keep going and keep going we've got about a quarter fast smell instantly as soon as you turn that on this thinks of fuel yeah hazards work probably gonna need them nothing's on fire check to see if his milky residues all right ninety-four thousand six hundred and sixty six look at that it doesn't look like it's gonna fold in half or anything don't say it I think you've done it Ethan's done it that I screw him down a bit more I said 200 on the phone can you go any lower considering that night the more money I save the more money I have like in fuel 191 died 5 I got me okay 105 for a magnificent Volvo let's do this let's do the paperwork there we go boys bought a car for a hundred and ninety five pounds that leaves us with 55 pounds for fuel and food this is a glorious moment ma let us depart 195 pounds jack buy whatever we do don't let Ethan know that we like this car no if we gave him that win his happiness would upset me oh it's so smooth the seats are glorious aren't they are the way it changes gear like butter the steering wheel isn't even wonky who's your detective work to me I was expecting everything to be Waukee all right so the speedo doesn't work should we think the aircon works that feels like aircon that's cold this is cold Ethan can you hear me that's very exciting news but we have more exciting news the air conditioning in this 195 pound Volvo actually works I'm a mind nothing hey conditioning doesn't work on my two and a half grand GTI listen your car's not worth two hours this is what being a car enthusiast is all about recycling awesome old cars water fine I should cut that bit out I'm gonna stick to 20 quid that's 35 quid for fuel food I've gone over Parker nothing could go wrong what's that right there should we just not worry about it I'll tell you what I'm gonna put my phone in front of it cover it now I can just see the ABS warning light showing other funny huh oh yeah good point that sounds like muddy Oh dick made 16 pence so we get any indication of miles per gallon at the minute well there's a venturi doubt that's the rear wash wife well it's good for that work or in the trade they call it a bead AJ get it wash wash wrong there's one thing there's Bobby at me Duncan is this disgusting steering this I'm not very classic take off oh oh I can hear that hot sticky what's growing on it what he likes for - Bob's doing by Lao it's time to go and get some food I've got how much have I got 30 pounds 30 British pounds you can get a lot of food for that we're gonna go overboard all right yeah maybe a time loads of time there's literally nothing that can go wrong sure shopping yeah [Music] alright alright you go crazy yeah well length you want it why have you done that I didn't mean to why have you done this the woman at the tilt just kept on going until it went for 39 pounds but I got us a football after oon there and we were gonna share this one I ran out of money you put on the barbecue is glorious where's the salad I'm really hungry though so at this point I don't really care [Music] right on time I'm very sorry about that if and I feel terrible any sincerity yeah you know what is it because I'm being insincere got a football we're gonna make in time we'll get there at quarter to seven we have made it hello mate oh yeah I'll do that miles exactly man yeah it's me it is now 1854 so six minutes to seven the challenge this morning was to buy a car from no more than 250 pounds we've done it as you can see behind me West Wittering Beach job done it's been an awesome adventure it's been a fun challenge why are you shaking your head you were eight pounds over with the parking for here as well I may have been eight pounds over a little bit but come on you know what's what's eight pounds between French colleagues anyway should go eat let's go eat [Music] so it's the end of a really fun day you know it's been a good adventure a very good challenge from you guys unexpected but we have proven that yes you can buy a car for under 250 pounds you can go to a place like West Wittering beach you can have a barbecue with your friends I said it your friends yeah it's been awesome how have you found it this is true I'm impressed I'm skeptical wouldn't you be I'll do it but we pulled off well I mean Ethan Ethan found the car which makes me really sick it was your idea to do this video anyway if you want to see us do more adventures and more challenges like this then let us know in the comments I hope you enjoyed this video make sure you subscribe to the

btaEDH775ko,The Daily Show with Trevor Noah,News,So Much Winning | The Daily Show,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btaEDH775ko,3 years ago,10M views,News,"from Comedy Central's World News headquarters in New York [Music] there's a new report tonight the president Trump may have lied his way on to Forbes magazine annual list of richest Americans back in the 1980s Trump first made the list in 1982 with a reported net worth of a hundred million dollars but the documents later proved he was only worth five million dollars he lied about how many apartments the Trump Organization owned how much the units were worth and that Trump not his father owned the apartments that's right all the way back in 1982 Trump apparently got onto the very first Forbes list by lying about his net worth and claiming that the stuff that his dad owned was actually his which is a classic lie every twenty-year-old would recognize you know it's like let's get out of here girl I got my own place above my dad's garage now Trump lying to Forbes because he's me it could easily be seen as just someone trying to boost his ego but it turns out that trumps lie may have gotten him a whole lot more than just some flattering press because Donald never had an actual statement of his assets and his liabilities he used the Forbes 400 and this statement of inflated assets to borrow billions and billions of dollars which he used to build Atlantic City and over leveraged himself you're saying he wanted to use the Forbes list to fraudulently induced people to fund him in ways they otherwise would not that's correct okay I don't know about you but this is mind-blowing Trump lied to get onto the Forbes list then the Forbes list cemented him as a mogul and then he used his mogul status to get to the White House because remember his success story wasn't just a minor detail of who he was it was the very heart of his campaign Forbes just came out and they said I'm worth four and a half four five billion dollars I'm really rich I'm not even saying that in a braggart that's the kind of mindset that's the kind of thinking you need for this country so look I'm really a good businessman I'm so good at business Oh people are gonna be so rich so fast you don't even you don't know how rich you're gonna be you're gonna go from a debtor nation it's gonna be you you're gonna say wow what happened you know in retrospect I feel like we should have asked for penis turns out Pew was a Muslim bad who would have thought you may remember that during the presidential campaign Donald Trump had a number of ambitious goals like bringing back coal jobs and launching Hillary at the moon but perhaps his most grandiose goal was this you're a deal person right the ultimate deal is that deal Israel Palestine you are you're gonna make it that probably is the hardest deal there is to make if I'm gonna be President I'd rather be in a position because I will try the best I can and I'm a very good deal maker I believe me to try and solve that puzzle you're not gonna solve it if you're gonna be on one side or another everyone understands them now first of all first of all props to Trump for thinking that the ultimate deal is peace in the Middle East and not the number four at McDonald's that's a step up I like that and also I'm in Preston how confidence he was I bet in his head he was just thinking all I gotta do is have Michael Cohen paid the Palestinians 130 thousand dollars and then poof problem solved no problem folks and to be honest this is one of those issues where part of me was willing to give Trump a chance I mean Israel and Palestine have been fighting for 70 years right in my head I was like what's the worst thing Trump could do well today he answered that question the Trump administration of ending decades of established American policy officially moving the US Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem that added fuel to the fire of weeks of Palestinian protests along the Gaza border more than 50 Palestinians killed by the Israeli military more than 2,000 injured now I don't care who you are I think we can all agree this was a horrible loss of life that sadly anyone could have predicted these ratings and the Palestinians both claimed Jerusalem as their capital so America moving its embassy to Jerusalem before even holding peace talks was bound to be a provocative move and there was a moment where Trump considered not doing it but not out of concern for the human cost they said sir we're building an embassy in Jerusalem sir I said how much something other presidents don't ask but that's something they said I kid you not they said sir 1 billion dollars I said a billion you know what a billion dollars is so I called David I'd stop signing by the way I had Donald do an Ald and then it was like dead ball and then all of a sudden I stopped never got to the tee and I started putting excess cos I was afraid that somebody could say it was my signature and as angry as the Palestinians are too many Israelis Trump is a hero the Israeli people also celebrating the occasion pro-trump signs a signal of president Trump's growing popularity in the country the mayor of Jerusalem has put up an image of the old wall it actually shows an animated US flag and Israeli flags the large soccer club is changing its name to honor the president the bait our Jerusalem football club will now be known as bait our Trump Jerusalem's that's right Trump has gotten so popular that they're naming an Israeli soccer team after him which is perfect because a lot of people don't know this but that team only won their league because James Comey stepped in and tripped a play on the opposing team yeah everyone was confused though like what is James Comey doing here they're like I don't know Trevor needed him for the joke and here's the thing if Trump wants to take Israel's side that's his prerogative but at least be honest about it right instead of stoking the flames at the same time you're saying this our greatest hope is for peace the United States remains fully committed to facilitating a lasting peace agreement if you're Palestinian you probably think that statement is absolute [ __ ] and I can understand why because essentially although America says it's the referee it's basically just showing up to game two in a Cavs Jersey as Ike yeah I'm gonna be totally fair right LeBron Wang Wang down to that breaking news those three Americans who have been held by North Korea they are now back in the United States just after 3:00 a.m. the three American prisoners released from North Korea stepped out of that plane and into a made-for-tv moment produced by the President himself one saying it's like a dream wow what a happy ending and I can see where one of these guys said it's like a dream because one of these prisoners was taken during the Obama administration and now he's like wait the apprentice guy is president is this a dream but still but still let's not hate congratulations to president Trump for getting these men freed yeah and I honestly mean it I mean it their families will be happy to have them back their spy agencies will also be happy to have them back and I think we can all agree that it's a great moments and we can also agree that Donald Trump can make a really great moment very weird John really was excellent to these three incredible people it's very early in the morning I think you probably broke the all-time in history television rating for three o'clock in the morning that I would say you know only Trump could be thinking about TV ratings in the middle of a hostages coming home party I like it's 3:00 a.m. who cares about ratings like the Donald Trump have a rivalry with the lady from the pasta boat infomercial are you doing it's also strange that Trump said Kim jong-un was excellent to the prisoners it's almost like they were the hostages but Trump is the one with Stockholm Syndrome he was very nice so nice I love him and I'm happy that these guys are home you know they went through a lot physical abuse emotional abuse they were forced to eat disgusting food in a cramped space where they couldn't move their arms and legs and that was just their flight back on Spirit Airlines a North Korean labor camp in the sky I'm hereby directing the Department of Defense and Pentagon to immediately begin the process necessary to establish a space force as the sixth branch of the Armed Forces that's a big statement we are going to have the Air Force and we are going to have the space force separate but equal' there's no place like space the space force base force I don't even know I don't even know where to start right he just cancelled military exercises on the Korean Peninsula because they were too expensive now he's literally blasting that money into space the same guy I don't top of that I don't if you pick that up but separate-but-equal yeah why would he say that it's almost like Trump is sneaking racist Easter eggs into his presidency now he's like and introducing the mascot for space force Jim the crow everybody the nation's media may be focused on kids and cages being ripped apart from their families at the border but down here in Trump country they only wanted to talk about one thing we need Facebook making space great again I am so excited about space or there was just one question what is space for us something we've been missing for a long time good to go to space space for us is a little bit of everything it's like the cast of Modern Family there you go isn't it fun to say it's a safe space for us space for the next generation it's exciting isn't it what is it it is what they refer to as cloud computer so space force is items it's where all my music is yeah I agree it's not been what is space force you know space exploration and yeah um just finding out what's out there I guess but NASA does space exploration NASA is only gonna tell us what they want us to know whereas I think Trump will send his own stuff and we will find out the truth who would leave space for Smeal Armstrong okay I mean he is dead we have to bring him back to life I think but the military has advised President Trump that we don't need a space force Trump says then man be more and and he's gonna tell us the truth about what's out there when you're in Trump's universe everyone loves space force but why do we need space force terrorists could through the use of drones get into space and become a very dangerous hazard to freedom I'm sure that there will be war in space let's not forget 9/11 okay I think that space force could help prevent the next 9/11 which would be 9 12 9 12 13 I think Isis could get to space space Isis space Isis right space Isis but do we really need a space force doesn't make a lot of sense and would be less than a lot of dollars but at the same time it's just gonna be cool we need to have a space for us it's gonna be a waste of money yeah but it's gonna be cool right so we need to have you stand by that statement and by the statement hardpan yeah space for us pretty much pretty much we need regulations in space because you can do whatever you want isn't Trump against regulation yeah yeah I just stuttered myself here you know what space force it's just a cool name it's this cool name and that's good enough breaking news today Justice Anthony Kennedy the crucial swing vote on the Supreme Court for years is retiring setting the stage for a fierce battle over the future of the highest court in all the land when Justice Kennedy steps down at the end of next month July the 31st the court will be split for liberal justices and for conservatives President Trump now has the chance to give conservatives a solid majority one that in theory could last for many decades that's right people Justice Kennedy officially resigned and the reason this is so big is that Kennedy was without question the most powerful justice on the court and not just because he can deadlift 650 pounds but also because while he was generally conservative Kennedy did sometimes vote with liberals right he votes it in favor of gay rights the women's rights choose and affirmative action and he was the deciding vote now Trump will likely replace him with the Justice who would discriminate and dismantle abortion rights and LGBTQ rights and that that sound you're hearing right now that's Mike Pence having his first orgasm yeah I cast you out see man the landscape of American justice is shifting dramatically tonight on news that 81 year old Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy is retiring and now for the second time at his presidency Donald Trump is poised to exercise one of the president's most consequential powers nominating the courts next justice so we have a to come up we have to pick a great one we have to pick one that's gonna be there for 40 years 45 years god damn this is so crazy iq realized regardless of what happens in his presidency now Donald Trump will leave a mark on this country for decades to come yeah it's like it's not gonna go away it's like he's giving America judicial herpes you realize his court picks will be around for so long that they'll be ruling on major legal questions way into the future like whether or not Elon Musk can marry his robot slaves like we where it's gonna go and I here's the thing I can handle the idea of Donald Trump being president for a few years what blows my mind though is that he will be able to fundamentally reshape America for generations Donald Trump is gonna shape America this guy and I'd look it right in that fat ugly face of hers I'd say Rosie you're fired the power to redefine what America is this guy Bing Bing bong bong Bing Bing Bing seriously this guy Trump steaks are by far the best tasting most flavorful beef you've ever had out of all the people that could have been it's this guy I've said that if he vodka weren't my daughter perhaps I'd be dating her you never know with the new Supreme Court's that sure could be legal you never know yeah that's what you work for you never know he's there like that's what I've been working for folks I've been really trying baby trying to hold back these feelings for so long anyway anyway a Supreme Court judge stepping aside is never a small thing but this one could have especially far-reaching consequences because while Anthony Kennedy was generally conservative one of the notable things that he did was consistently protect roe v-- wade AKA a woman's rights to choose which makes this the moments that the anti-abortion movement has been waiting for a kennedy departure could also put abortion rights in doubt he has consistently supported the basic holding of roe v-- wade a trump nominee would probably oppose it where row v Wade is really the Dred Scott decision of the twentieth century I think you're gonna see that overturned we have a chance to take down roe v wade this is a historic moment in the pro-life community today that's right after Justice Kennedy is replaced there's a good chance that many states will make abortion illegal and for many evangelicals that has been the Holy Grail it's why many Christians have supported to continue Donald Trump even though he sins so much that people cost him out of demons it's like big on Trump oh oh thank you I felt so gross Oh oh I mean your own daughter oh wow you might be really sad that women will be losing some of their fundamental rights but the media is licking its lips on Capitol Hill the battle lines drawn a huge battle in Washington over replacing Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy this will be a battle all summer all fall it will be one of the most contentious political battles in decades okay I'm sorry but like what battle are we talking about here I understand these guys are trying to drum up ratings but it's not true Republicans control the Senate okay the Democrats have no power and no way to stop them from confirming Trump's Supreme Court pick like the media is hyping this up like it's a heavyweight fights but this is more like a fight between Floyd Mayweather and a baby you know there's like and in the blue corner weighing in at 7 pounds and cranky after missing his nap it's Timmy [Applause] the two leaders seemed to have an instant rapport the minute kim jeong-hoon made history by becoming the first North Korean leader to step foot in the South in a brief diplomatic dance he invited president moved across the military demarcation line back into the north now it may look funny but we just witnessed a giant moments in history that's the first time those leaders have stepped foot in the other ones country like you know there was a part of Kim Jong Moon as well they just wanted to be like now please step into my country got him if the North Korea talks end up in Kim actually giving up his nukes this would be one of the greatest peace deals we've ever seen broken which is why believe it or not South Korea's president says that president Trump deserves the Nobel Peace Prize because he says this never would have happened if Trump hadn't played bad cop you know like really bad cop like worst cop ever like like I'll let you borrow my gun for five dollars cop and Trump winning the Nobel Peace Prize or any prize is an idea that mega supporters really love I remember you know it was very rough three four months ago that's worse no bail you know that has to be the world's first Nobel Peace Prize chance like that's how rowdy Trump's crowds although they'll chump anything they'll be at a funeral like condolences condolences condolences always in our hearts always in our hearts and now look I understand some people argue that Trump didn't actually do much but South Korea's president he doesn't care right he's happy to share the glory and Trump agrees with him except for the share pot I had one of the fake news groups this morning now they were saying what do you think President Trump had to do with it I'll tell you what Mike how about everything yeah I hope they have a Nobel Prize for humility too because this guy he just killed the game [Music] [Music] you",20:32

I just gave them the card and every time we go through they're just charging
that one credit card. So that's why we're not
having to swipe it every time. (upbeat drum music)

food until the day I die. This was enough. (upbeat music)

x5nEb-7UKZI,Gordon Ramsay,Food,Gordon Is Blown Away By Small Indian Restaurants Performance & Food | Ramsay's Best Restaurant,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5nEb-7UKZI,2 years ago,26M views,Food,"[Music] over the last six months my team and I have been checking out your best restaurant nominations all over the country and tonight the competition continues the one of Britain's most popular cuisines Indian curry is a national obsession and these days we will expect really high standards from our Indian restaurants I spent a lot of time out in India and learn for myself what real good Indian food is all about so tonight's restaurant has been lovely good to impress rate from over 2,000 Indian nominations I've chosen what I think are the best to to fight it out for a place in the semi-finals tonight from Bradford the Currie capsule of the north its Prashad I know they go head to head with world-famous cuisine from a London heavyweight the brilliant in Southall give me the brother come on my father was a top chef in India used to cook for the Maharajah's this competition could be the ultimate test for both minded contenders there we're battles the very end because only one restaurant can come out on top to find that winner both contenders will face two frite challenging tests starting with a coach low of 30 hungry diners who arrive and order all at once first they'll descend on the Patel family who run tiny Prashad in bradford there are over 60 Indian restaurants alone in this fantastic city but this one is somewhat special the smallest restaurant this competition but I think it's gonna give the big boys a serious run for the money hello Bobby thank God good to see you oversee well thank you yeah I've never had a vegetarian restaurant in the competition so I'm so excited I'm happy as well in just under half an hour my Donna's gonna be here they think they're coming for an amazing lamb bhuna so convert them this place used to be a laundrette now it's a 22 seat restaurant run by Kaui patel with her son Bobby and his wife me now being vegetarian what we put passion into other restaurants offer a side dish we have to really step up we really have to bring the flavors out give them something totally different incredibly me now the head chef had never cooked professionally until she married Bobby moved to England and joined his mum in the kitchen six years ago she is not my daughter-in-law she's my daughter I can describe how much I love cooking whatever I cook it from my heart it's delicious one mouthful of that I feel like I'm back in Mumbai the exact same for my diners please now I can't leave that to waste I've gotta eat some more that I'm sorry we have a huge drive huge ambition we didn't come into this business thinking we're gonna make loads of money we came into the business about showing the world how good we are at food now they must prove it because my 30 diners are just minutes away they were expecting a perfect meal and everyone must be served in just two hours the pressures on you big time and I know this means a lot I can see it on your face but here's your chance now to really stamp your hold on this competition good luck standing up right now let's show Ramsey let's go Ramsey's best restaurant pretty hard to accommodate my guest Bobby had to squeeze an extra eight seats into the tiny dining room sorry a little bit of a small restaurant where the food is fantastic I promise you despite its size Rashad has huge ambitions to fly the flag for vegetarian Indian cuisine first time in a vegetarian restaurant yes let's hope is the member experience yeah I'm dead anyone I'm a confirmed Calabar anything without me the clusters of meal my diners are gonna be a hard crowd to please and we'll take a massive team effort to convert them okay here we go I need dog walks on mix baccarat and I need three person fifty no problem my nails like the new girl on the blocking I'm just hoping that she can cope with such a demands because she's the least experienced at the starter she's serving coconut pities potato and chickpea chat and spicy vegetable four cores this will be the hardest service of their lives no I need now she may be inexperienced but me now is got to drive this kitchen like never before bossun baby number four mummy Billy one we can't add one hour but however hard me now pushes her team they're barely able to keep up and this is just the first course I told you just listen what I'm saying it's all spin together you know very very fresh salads excellent it's nicely spiced not too hard but just right every plate clean was incredible all of them say fantastic food really really happy okay halfway there keep it going guys yes big push on the main courses now you want me to make a boy but the mains will be even harder every deep-fried puri and dosa pancake needs to be precisely timed only one hour left so you know I'm kidding funny prasad small kitchen is going hell-for-leather but these dishes just aren't leaving fast enough how long do they normally wait between courses roughly 10 minutes so the kitchen the size the gallery cook up such a space yeah we don't want to grow tables our way to blame for Caesar I need now I said that [Music] yes the pressures really on and some diners have been waiting for an hour just to let you know guys that this afternoon obviously we have all 30 guests in at once there may be a little bit of a way for your mains I hope you can be patient with this implication that she's fine isn't understand also I'm serving a good time explain to them they're crying about the fact that we'll be a little while well obviously there is a deadline on how much time we've got to serve I said wait what I said oh there's great synergy there between the dining room and the kitchen and they're working pretty well together they're supporting each other through every plates come on hurry up now that's for my toast yes yes the main courses have been badly delayed but Bobby's Charma the dining room has kept the customers onside and averted a crisis electric things interesting it's absolute delicious love these fries hotter in the center wait even the most ardent carnivores have been converted amazing presentation and then the test itself was live darling look but sometimes I think is even bad service is over okay and it's time for the Prasad team to hear my verdict okay let's cut to the chase the the problem I have having witnessed the service is that you've you've now just completely and I mean really completely blown open this whole competition you've raised the bar Bobby the communication and making sure that customers not agitated waiting for food you're there and it sounded amazing me now I was nervous about you but that first ticket came on and you were just on fire thank you and you've made 30 of my diners the happiest I've ever heard them [Applause] do not go backwards you maintain and improve on what you've got an amazing standard of vegetarian cuisine it's gonna take some beating my coach load of 30 diners are about to descend on the second Indian restaurants battling for a place in the semi-finals of my nationwide restaurant competition it's the brilliant in London voted for by you in droves that's almost as long as I've been around it has three generations of customers and any Russian that can boast that must be do something absolutely spot-on B&N family have been running this punjabi restaurant for 40 years with Dibner shankar and dad guru at the helm this is a huge ship and to be right amongst the best it just encourages us more and more to do even better these days good is retired from the stove leaking the brilliants kitchen in the hands of head chef jazz all the ingredients all the meats they're cooked fresh the piping hot served to the first move in thank you the brilliant is known for its Park Service I don't want people waiting for more than five or six minutes you walk in here you taste the food and you really start to believe they've earned their place as a front runner of Indian food in this country boasting to them twenty seats 28 years in the deep food guide and over 80 awards the brilliant is an Indian heavyweight delicious ready good excellent happy I'm about to hit them with my first challenge like Prashad that also have just two hours to serve my 30 diners who will arrive in order all at once it takes some balls to call it the brilliant because you can't be anything less than brilliant what a night like tonight yeah we are very confident we've got only 30 diners we're gonna make sure these guests have a fantastic experience maybe said brilliant service hi Jess yeah yeah right how's it sounding yeah what are you thinking of having on the menu tonight are two of the house specialities lamb chops marinated in nutmeg and cardamom and king prawns with fresh herbs and lime juice both cooked in the traditional tandoor oven two abortions and three lamb chops and 2/3 ori prawns but i'm worried hf jazz is only used one of the kitchen - $10 ovens and already tandoori orders are racking up three prawns one lamb chops come on guys let's go Tennille how long for pond five minutes marvelous you need to get a move on your pleat is Republican doorman why are you - it is now but not the beginning that's what you want to say please get a move on please this is not brilliant come on guys please when I need this out from here come on how long to the first time chops please okay good it looks like it's been half-eaten I've got another one that looks a little bit better the thing is given the cuts yeah I know that if I start eating that and I go to that it looks like someone's taking a bite out of it I've only seen it for you you can say no Gordon that's how I'm sending it fine okay give me one more piece off lamb chop please I'm not trying to cut you out you're just saying yeah that's not you at your best [Music] and it's beautiful thank you smart to tables before five minutes is a joke used to do two countries 300 setting state see we should have been finished banner using just one tandoor oven has slowed service to a crawl and orders just aren't getting out why is that sat there won't let me go with that and get that thing the whole them all way to the kitchen come on serve the food please please please there you go come on come on cut that make up ranching yeah I need the pawn why are they going in the oven where the cook this should be gone help me to understand you [Music] robbery attempt dispenser we hurry up because it's gonna be the longest time I've ever set a new restaurant laughing it's an unwelcome wake-up call for owner and ex head chef Gullu this kitchen needs leadership and jazz looks lost the Russians reputation hangs in the balance Julie's noise check on okay I need the proles plates no prongs near plates and wounded straight away in the area hurry up boys get me the prawns all the pros ready give me the problems come on straight straight we're good they're nice they're succulent full of flavor get me hot let's try finish Jana hiya okay next I need for many chickens with a piping hole [Music] we're gonna some life in the kitchen not more energy ditching that more importantly all men's in there so he's gonna put a rocket up their ass table number fight and now we're now we're fired up yeah get that on everybody it was far from a perfect start but for my diners the food has really hit the mark like creamy curries but this was something completely different and I specifically asked for it to be Marda and they did it to perfection it was stunning divine probably the best career I've ever had I love this Russians 40-year pedigree but tonight I've only got it together after a chaotic start okay those starters took too long let's leave this kitchen 30 covers tonight felt like 300 covers it was a little bit too casual but still it takes time yes especially the nori stuff which is because great from the stretch not good enough this restaurant is not used to sending out mediocre warm prawns you take your prawn from that sand or even and you stick it in there game over you've got to command that kitchen jazz from the outs main causes needed a rocket yeah you put your jacket on bang and it turns and the kitchen came to life from there it was the old man at the helm and here we go again there was that fire in your belly and you got it out don't get pissed off no get you get to come back you're gonna be even more strong enough thank you good night it was a bit of a shock to the system yeah we can still win this we can't we will win good [Music] my Indian restaurants reacted very differently to the pressure of the coast trip now I've asked them both to come to London so I can catch up with them what they don't realize is that I've been assessing them secretly I sent in my own undercover diners to Prashad and the brilliant to see how each wrestler performed when they have no idea I was watching and their guard was down Simon Davies is a meticulous food critic who's assessed the food and service at the houses of restaurants Saratoga Robinson has worked with me another top chefs for years helping to create a prefect thousands of dishes secret diners are very useful trick of the trade and they give you honest immediate feedback and no holds barred I've asked Sarah and Simon to be deliberately awkward customers to see how the restaurants cope [Music] and you either so why should I eat it the teens think they're here to discuss their performance with my 30 diners they have no idea what I'm about to show them first up Rapids push our food was brilliance the problem I have now is that was that just done for me or does that restroom function like that every day every day how can you say that because we do it every day we passionately do it every day so yes we know the what we're doing is a good because our customer tell us that was a big test you've actually been tested twice after I left I sent in a secret diner and a secret filmed everything filmed filmed [Music] do we need a reservation or can we just have so much yeah we okay you can you give me a steer on what to have I can't really decide oh I'm feeling quite hungry hungry yeah I'm feeling quite hungry things not to miss if you're sharing would be patties and would be charged and where's this is this mainly southern India Okeechobee similar to Rajasthani oh no no is a lot more feature dear whereas ours is a lot of delicate right okay not as raw great first interaction of the diners the food will speak for itself you know we have that as a given so it's up to me to kind of make that person feel comfortable if they have a questions to answer them openly and with as much information as they can give Charlie we go award-winning cartoonist first [Music] love that coconut remove level up through emanate that will be 20 30 seconds gonna tasting different flavors are still coming for just cuz SWAT the curry quite late in the day and see what they do excuse me could I change one of my curries can I it's alright any goes any any vegetable handy of it yeah his bags it's good dry I couldn't have done with that better you could ask you could say that this one we have a bit more punch in this one you see we can play around with that it's only to do to make that one a little bit hotter oh yeah we're not to the degree that you know you just laugh us when we walk out the door I love live and that came back like a fresh dish no hassle at all it's so refreshing to see that level of flexibility there's no intimidation you're not making them feel awkward there's no guilt if I if I hadn't have behaved that way in front of my customers I know two people in the kitchen would have been very angry at me he's the big boss this place an Americano actually surprisingly it's got some of the best Indian food probably ever eaten you must blow me away with it it's been really fantastic fresh sourced expertly done and done with passion and knowledge really well done thank you you made me feel nervous because you raised the bar so high but I didn't think you could do that again I'm feeling fantastic you know Gordon Ramsay big big man telling me that you know everything we're doing is good we were nervous before I just can't contain it so far Prasad of punching way above their weight but I have concerns over how much this tiny Russian depends on bobbies front-of-house charm tonight two fantastic Indian restaurants are battling it out in my nationwide competition to find my best restaurant now it's time for London restaurant the brilliant to find out I've been snooping on them unknown to all of you once I left the brilliant I then sent in my secret diners and this is what they saw on the coast trip head chef jazz failed to take control of the kitchen and at times the food suffered only Gullu had to step up to the tandoor to save the day have the brilliant learn from their mistakes I'm going to take this [Music] and everyone your choice whose idea is all those screens and the music they've been around for quite a while and some customers actually like them are quite adapted to the idea but then you do obviously get a clash sometimes and when when we are asked we do mellow it down [Music] refreshment chopping as fantastic as my for drink is so fresh it's absolutely delicious this chapter really so many different things so many different flavors and really getting palette like a type going nice really good start fresh clean chutneys exciting vibrant and a really nice way of relaxing customers really nice way one of the problems about this possible even foods to help out the real test hello thank you [Music] jazz prawns white they're coming out overcook still a so now we take the prawns old complete solved in I'd ask you to look at that seriously in terms of I tended to cook them less I think what we need to do is every portion of prawns that goes out this week do one extra prawn and test it before it goes out because that's something that we need to work on spicy food [Music] that's really caring thank you patience and time third time lucky thank you very much [Music] love that customer's always right that's what the painful you can adapt to the customers needs great [Music] [Music] when the food arrives they love the food when the service matches the food you have something quite exciting there jazz I want you to step up to the mark I need to do something I think I am bit nervous right now but later on would envelop the confidence amazing we've got to be so positive to make sure that we learn from the mistakes my undercover evidence has hit them hard now they need to learn from this experience there's no time to waste because both restaurant chefs are about to face their biggest challenge yet [Music] I'll be taking them out of their kitchens and into mine I asked them to create and cook a dish that lives up to the standards and my three Michelin star restaurants I'm very very very exciting today to cooking in the Gordon Ramsay's restaurant I'm putting her my hundred percent part in it the dreamer for every chef to cook for a three soil restaurant and I'm looking forward in winning this completion tonight one of them will win a place in the semi-finals and one will be eliminated [Music] this is my dream here everything I've ever worked for it's a small beautiful restaurant and it's an amazing place for both of your restaurants today to really shine I asked you to come here to take it to a different level with your foods and really aspire to do something unique at the end of it sadly there's only one restaurant that's going through the semi-final make sure it's you good luck I've challenged both chef's to create one exquisite course big amount of pressure on their shoulders today because they've got to develop and evolve those dishes into something stunning I'm expected a dish that's perfectly spiced with delicious textures and sublime flavors but it's not just me they have to impress I've invited 20 guests who know their bodies from their brionna's to come and try both fresh Toones dishes including phenom Ali founder of the British curry awards and respected Indian cookbook author and broadcaster Manju Marley all my diners will try both restaurants dishes each restaurants front-of-house teams are here as my guess and I'll be watching the chef's every move and there's nowhere to hide okay it's for the brilliant except for covers away Table six yeah for JAL crazy okay tonight the Brillion are taken on prasad at their own game cooking a vegetarian take on a much-loved classic paneer jalfrezi jazzy's recipe matches chili laden Indian curd cheese with a sauce flavored with unique blend of 15 spices I'm making my own cheese today WoW is that a bit crazy on a day like today chef I'm in your rest and after whoo something crazy this is the type of flourish just needs to lift this classic dish to new heights opportunities like these never knocked on your doors that's the reason why I'm working so hard I want to achieve something today and I'm excited to see sous chefs Anil making a speciality rarely found in the UK paper-thin Ramarley roti and all that are brilliant for couples away Table one guys look at me just like a normal restaurant I need an answer right well you don't answer me I'm just gonna stop and look at you again okay because like you're doing your kitchen you get a response but I'm calling out tickets and no one's responding just acknowledge what I'm saying right otherwise I just go like this [ __ ] it stick the stickers are burn I've got a call out for jalfrezi thank you welcome back so far in this competition HF jazz has produced some stunning traditional Punjabi cuisine for the brilliant but on occasion he's lost control of the kitchen his food has missed the mark and owner Gullu has had to save the day you got no good news in the kitchen today you don't need him in the kitchen do you know you've got your work cut out hey Tanya this is the biggest moment in our history of the brilliant night the hopes and dreams of the brilliant rests on Jazz's shoulders Yahoo that I can't say it up it's just all so yeah I've got the mayor of eating out that we're serving food clinging on like something coming out of a dog's [ __ ] Table one let's go first dish coming from brilliant Thank You charlie smells good you know like the news nicer softer the Chili's got a kick Wow if I can see you then I noticed in an hour who comes away several five four stunning kofta yes yes Prashad I'm making vegetable kofta steamed and spiced chopped vegetables encasing a potato patty deep fried then served in a fresh tomato sauce the sauce is quite hot medium spices midges but lots of flavor you need [Music] don't put those copters in there too early to stand to break up a vegetable Koster is very hard to get right for some of the elements they can explode and sort of disintegrates getting the timing right on this dish is critical so minal and Cal she need to work together perfectly I mean it is lovely you need to be a bit faster I am partly look at here what are you doing come on tributes on hello just a minute in her own kitchen may now struggle with the pressure and only just came out on top and tonight there's no supportive husband Bobby in the kitchen to help her by now I'm pretty sure if I know mineral and my mom they'll be right in the middle of the cooking and just totally focused on giving you the best food but this is my kitchen aminals way out of a comfort zone anybody seen my onion it was here there you go look after every table we have to play down we can't continue working in a mess yeah thank you look after you comedians yeah come on can I have that please let me get do you have some water hold on oh god mama ladies we look above Monday oh boy look at me now my cute service go let's go please no it's for I sit for and worry about that it's cool listen to me listen to me I'm hell I'm is help you you confuse yourself not me far away please thank you it's a very very very lot of pressure me and mum were going through a lot of press a lot to do it's very complicate this so it's mid time so this I am I'm just panicking it's a vegetable kofta temple three please [Music] this is very very bad it's lovely shake the presentation is immaculate and beautiful looking it's really nice isn't it last that will please men out Kelsey volkoff's always nice very nice you lay down virtually well done so hard service is over so it's time to discover my distinguished guests thought of both restaurants dishes starting with a brilliant really good see let's told the chef Rosie how is that for you adult first joking combination is very good also the paneer also I found is tasty is not only the cheese it is correct spice yes presentation also remarkable Mali roti that's very very traditional this is very hard to make I was really nervous I am now relieving they've they've done a fabulous job because of the cook those were nice nice and delicious and you could taste the fresh ginger so that was great it looked good as well the dishes awesome the only thing I'd say the price is supposed to be nice and fluffy and separately they've got some other got defective profits right but overall I think this is excellent phenomenally proud the dish that they've made today you know I definitely think that we've done our very best my diners clearly loved the food though neither restaurant quite achieved perfection now it's up to me to choose a winner whatever I decide will affect the future of both these restaurants if I lose today I really break down I need to win I really need to win this competition but I don't know so my name is it's definitely going to be I think we gave over 400 percent and we are happy we are fighting we are the thing we are dealing with John only one Indian restaurant can go through to the semi-finals and after tonight's service the decision is going to be tougher than ever my two top Indian restaurants the brilliant from London and fresh start from Bradford have completed their final challenge they are both exceptional restaurants but one of them is about to be eliminated to help me make my choice I'm gonna taste each of their dishes huh scoffs ah it's a fate difficult one to get right those vegetables bound with a potato and that rich tomato gravy the downside a little bit of faffing around unnecessary on the plate I'd rather see one big stunning one as opposed to three individual ones cut in the middle you can see those vegetables oh my god pretty tasty the right amount of heat and that nice textured kofta rice shame the rice actually let it down it Sam was overcooked they're brilliant jalfrezi chilies everywhere red and green chili and the secret of this shelf crazy is the texture and a balance of the heat they've got the heat corrected masala it definitely needs that right to cool it down paneer delicious handmade and made here and that takes a lot of skill the only issue I have there is the the rawness the vegetables those crunchy peppers are sort of spoiling the texture of the jaw crazy both restaurants felt the pressure here today and both of them haven't hit it a hundred percent now they've fallen short of the last hurdle both questions [Music] to our standing Indian restaurants only one can win a place in the next round [Music] okay first of all that was a very interesting service I could identify issues from both restaurants in a way that I didn't expect from brilliant paneer jalfrezi sumptuous delicious finding that balance where the masalas is a tough one love the way you had the balls to make that premier the one issue I had was the the rawness of the vegetables the peppers were barely cooked and it didn't completely spoil the dish but it didn't enhance it Rashaad I thought the koftas were a bold move love the vegetables inside delicious the gravy was seasoned beauty and had that right amount of heat the big shop for me was the the overcooked rice I've eaten in your restaurant and I know how well you cook and I didn't expect to see overcooked rice today this competition is not going to be won or lost on one dish alone I'm looking for the best restaurant in Britain brilliant I turn up with a coach load of diners 30 of them jumping into the restaurant eager to taste that food we got off to a sluggish start but my god did those diners enjoy that food I send in my secret diners and again I've never seen a restaurant so excited to help when it's not even their fault good sign Prasad I turn up in the back of beyond of

there's only one restaurant going through to semi-final the restaurant going through based on everything I've seen and tasted [Music] mr. Saab [Applause] [Music] [Music] well done that restaurant will continue being unique there's no two ways about that and that was for me one of the tightest and the closest decisions I've ever had to make in our journey of 35 years we've won numerous awards and would be would be back again the show carries on and the brilliant was carry on really well done I'm so happy for the family and for the restaurant why because the food is extraordinary oh happy I can even think about it so happy I'm so happy it was really difficult for me because I wasn't in there every single step of the way as a family whenever we perform we're always together service kitchen everything together today I had to sit back and look like I was even enjoying food and I didn't have an appetite at all but you know we're just I can't I can't tell you what an extraordinary day and I'm quite sad to say goodbye to brilliant but you've got to give up for Prasad they were amazing now the competition really starts for them there through the semi-final and they are gonna have to really really pull stops out",42:28
M64HUIJFTZM,3Blue1Brown,Science,"The unexpectedly hard windmill question (2011 IMO, Q2)",1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M64HUIJFTZM,2 years ago,3.9M views,Science,"Every year, more than 100 countries send 6
of their brightest teenagers, or the occasional pre-pubescent prodigy, to represent them in
the International Math Olympiad, commonly known as the IMO. Considering that each country has its own
elaborate system of contests leading to their choice of 6 representatives, the IMO stands
as the culminating symbol for the surprisingly expansive and wonderful world which is contest
math. The contest is essentially a test, split over
two days, with three questions given over four and a half hours each day. The questions are all proofs, meaning you
don’t simply find some numerical answer, you have to discover and articulate a rigorous
line of reasoning to answer each difficult question, and they are scored on a scale from
0 to 7. Of interest to us today is the one from 2011,
with 563 total participants representing 101 countries. I know what your thinking, and the answer
is yes. Those do all happen to be prime numbers. But that’s not why this test was interesting,
out of these prime problem solvers, only one, Lisa Saurmann from Germany, got a perfect
score. The only thing standing between the next two
runners up and a perfect score that year was problem #2. This problem is beautiful, and despite evading
many of the world’s best mathematicians of their age, the solution is something which
anyone watching this video can understand. So let’s begin by reading it carefully. “Let S be a finite set of at least two points
in the plane” Mmkay, as you read a question it’s often
helpful to start drawing out an example for yourself. “Assume that no three points of S are collinear” In other words, you never have three points
that line up. So you can probably predict that the problem
involves drawing lines here in a way where three points on one line would mess things
up. “A windmill is a process that starts with
a line l going through a single point P in S. The line rotates clockwise about the pivot
P until the first time that the line meets some other point belonging to S”. Again, while reading it’s helpful to draw
out an example, so we’ve got this line pivoting around some point until it hits another. “This point, Q, takes over as the new pivot,
and the line now rotates clockwise about Q, until it next meets a point of S. This process
continues indefinitely”. Alright, that’s kind of fun. We keep rotating and changing the pivot. You can see why they call it a windmill process,
and you can also see why they specified that no three points lie on one line. You wouldn’t want to run into the ambiguity
where you don’t know what pivot to switch to. Okay, so what’s the question? “Show that we can choose a point P in S
and a line l going through P such that the resulting windmill uses each point of S as
a pivot infinitely many times.” Depending on your tolerance of puzzles for
puzzles’ sake, you might wonder why anyone would care about such a question. There’s a very good reason: I’d argue
that the act of solving this will make you better at math and other related fields, which
I’ll explain once you’ve seen the solution. But certainly on it surface this feels disconnected
from other parts of math. Other Olympiad problems involve some function
to analyze, or a numerical pattern to deduce, or perhaps a difficult counting setup or an
elaborate geometric construction, but problem 2 is an unusually pure puzzle. In some ways, that’s its charm: proving
that some initial condition will result in this windmill hitting all points infinitely
many times doesn’t test if you know a particular theorem, it tests if you can find a clever
perspective. But that blade cuts both ways; without resting
existing results from math, what could someone possibly study that would prepare them to
solve this? In fact, this brings us to the second unusual
thing about this problem: Based on the results, I’m guessing it turned out to be much harder
than the contest organizers expected. You see, typically, the three problems in
each day are supposed to get progressively harder. They’re all hard, of course, but problems
1 and 4 should be doable, problems 2 and 5 should be challenging, and problems 3 and
6...well they can be brutal. But take a look at how many of the 563 participants
that year got perfect scores on each problem: Only 22 got a perfect score for this question
number 2. By contrast, 170 got a perfect score on problem
5, which is supposed to be about the same difficulty, and more than twice as many, got
a perfect score for problem 3, which is supposed to be harder. You might notice that only six students got
full points for problem 6 that year, so by some measure that was the hardest problem
on the test. In fact, the way I introduced things earlier
was a little disingenuous, the full data would suggest problem 6 was the real clincher. But what’s strange is if you look at the
results of the only six students to solve problem 6, all of whom are clearly phenomenal,
world-class problem solvers, this windmill puzzle evaded five out of six of them. But again, this problem is hard not hard because
of the background knowledge it demands, it asks only for insight. So how do you approach something like this? The first step with any puzzle like this is
simply to play around to get a feel for it, and it’s always good to start simple and
slowly get more complicated from there. The simplest case would be two points, where
the line trades off between each point, so that works well enough. Adding a third point, it’s pretty clear
the line will just rotate around all of them. It might not be entirely clear how you’d
phrase that as a rigorous proof yet, but right now you’re just getting a feel for things. The fourth point is where things get interesting. In some places, your windmill will go around
the four points as it did with the triangle, but if we put it inside that triangle, then
it looks like our windmill never hits it. Looking back at the problem, it’s asking
you to show that for some starting position of the line, not any position, the process
will hit all the points infinitely many times. So for an example like this, if you start
with the line going through that troublesome middle point, what happens? And again, at this point you're just playing
around, perhaps moving your pencil among dots you’ve drawn on your scratch paper, questions
of rigor and proof will come later. Here you’d see that your windmill does indeed
bounce off all the points as it goes through a cycle, and it ends up back where it started. The worry you might have is that in some large
set of points, where some are kind of inside the others, you might be able to start off
on the inside, but maybe the windmill process takes the line to the outside, where it will
be blocked off from those inner points. If you play around, and it might take some
time to draw out many examples and think this through, you might notice that when the line
starts off passing the middle of all your points, it tends to stay there; it never seems
to venture off to the outside. But can you guarantee that this always happens? Or rather, can you first make this idea of
starting off in the middle more rigorous, and from there, prove that all points will
be hit infinitely many times? As a general problem-solving tip, whenever
you have a vague idea that feels productive, find a way to be more exact about what you
mean, preferably putting numbers to it, then ask questions about those numbers. In our example, one way to formalize the idea
of a “middle” is to count how many points are on either side of the line. If you give the line some orientation, you
can reasonably talk about the left half, say coloring all points to the left of it blue,
and the right half, coloring all points to the right of it brown, and what it means for
the line to be in the middle is that there are as many blue points and brown points. For the moment, let’s say the total number
of points is odd, and the point the line passes through is colored white. So for example, if there were 11 points, then
you’d have five blue ones on the left of the line, and five brown ones on the right
of the line, and the one white one at the pivot. The case with an even number of points will
be similar, just slightly less symmetric. This gives you a new question to ask: What
happens to the number of blue points and brown points as the process plays out? In the example shown, you might notice that
it’s always 5 and 5, never changing. Playing with other examples, you’d find
the same is true. Take a moment to pause and see if you can
think about why that would be true. Well, the key is to think through what happens
as a line changes its pivot. Having given the line an orientation, we can
talk about which half of the line is “above” the pivot, and which is “below”. If the line hits a blue point to its left,
it must happen below the pivot, so as it changes pivots and continues rotating clockwise, the
old pivot, now above the new one, ends up to the left of the line, in the blue region. And entirely symmetrically, when it hits a
brown point, it happens above the pivot, meaning that old pivot ends up in the brown region. So no matter what, the number of points on
a given side of the line can’t change. When you lose a blue point, you gain a new
one; when you lose a brown point, you also gain a new one. Great, that’s insight #1. Now why would this imply that the line must
hit every point infinitely many times, no matter what weird set of points you dream
up? Well, think about letting this process go
until the line has turned 180 degrees. That means it’s parallel to its starting
position, and because it has to remain the case that half the points are on one side,
half are on the other, it must be passing through the same point it started on. Otherwise, if it ended up on some other point,
it would change the number on a given side. Additionally, since the line has rotated halfway
around, everything that was blue has become brown, and everything which was brown has
become blue, and the only way to change color is if you get hit by the line. So for our odd number case, that means that
after a half rotation, the line is back to where it started having hit all the other
points. So as time moves forward, it repeats that
exact same set of motions over and over, hitting all points infinitely many times. If there are an even number of points, we
need to alter the scheme slightly, but only slightly. Let’s say that in that case, the pivot counts
as a brown point. So we can still select an initial point so
that half the points are blue, all on the left, and half are brown, now either meaning
their either on the right or the pivot. The same argument applies that after a 180-degree
turn, all the points will have swapped color, although this time the line might be passing
through a different point after that first half turn, specifically one that used to be
blue. But after another 180 degrees the line must
be passing through the same point it started on. Why? Again, it must be parallel to its starting
position, and if it was passing through any other point, the number of points on a given
side would be different. So again, you have a cycle which hits all
points, and which ends in the same position where it started, so it must hit all points
infinitely many times. There are two important lessons to take away
from this puzzle, the first social, the second mathematical. Once you know this solution and turn it about
in your head a couple times, it’s very easy to fool yourself into thinking the problem
is easier than it is. Of course the number of points on a given
side stays constant, right? And of course when you start in the middle,
every point will switch sides after a half-turn, right? But the advantage of this problem coming from
the IMO is that we don’t have to rest on subjective statements, we have the data to
show that this is a genuinely hard problem, in that it evaded many students are demonstrably
able to solve hard problems. In math, it’s extremely hard to empathize
with what it feels like not to understand something. I was discussing this video with a former
coworker of mine from Khan Academy who worked a lot on their math exercises, and he pointed
out that across the wide variety of contributors he’d worked with, there was one constant. No one can tell how difficult their exercises
are. Knowing when math is hard is often way harder
than the math itself. This is important to keep in mind when teaching,
but it’s equally important to keep in mind when being taught. On are windmill puzzle, even if counting the
number of points on one side seems obvious in hindsight, you have to ask, given the vast
space of possible things to consider, why would anyone’s mind ever turn to this particular
idea? This brings us to the mathematical takeaway. What ultimately led to the solution was finding
something about this complex system which stays constant during its chaotic unfolding. This is a ubiquitous theme through math and
physics. We’re finding what’s called an “invariant”. Topologists do this when the count the holes
in a surface, physicists do this in defining the ideas of energy and momentum, or in special
relativity when they define proper time. As a student, it’s easy to take for granted
the definitions handed down to us, but the more puzzles you solve where the insight involves
an invariant, the more you appreciate that each of these definitions was once a clever
discovery. Terence Tao, one of the greatest modern mathematicians
and the world’s youngest IMO medalist, wrote that “Mathematical problems, or puzzles,
are important to real mathematics (like solving real-life problems), just as fables, stories,
and anecdotes are important to the young in understanding real life.” Sure, they’re contrived, but they carry
lessons relevant to useful problems you may actually need to solve one day. Maybe it seems silly to liken this windmill
puzzle to a fairytale; a mathematical Aesop summarizing that the moral of the story is
to seek quantities which stay constant. But some of you watching this will one day
face a problem where finding an invariant reveals a slick solution, and you might even
look like a genius for doing so. If a made-up windmill prepares you for a real
problem, who cares that it’s a fiction?",16:03

Markiplier here, and thank you guys SO much for being with me through 1,000 videos. It's hard to even imagine how we've gotten from this point, and I really wanted to do something special for the 1,000 subscriber milestone. Or, not 1,000 subscriber, 1,000 video milestone. And I think this video is really going to explain to you guys how I got here from point A to point B. And how you guys have helped change my life. Because, these things are really important to me because they tell how I became the person that I am. And I really do appreciate you guys for sticking with me. So, HERE WE GO! I was born on an island in the middle of the pacific ocean called O'ahu which is the 3rd largest island of Hawaii. And home to the city of Honolulu, where I was born on a military base. My Dad was a career army man, he'd been in the army 23 years before he retired. Apparently while he was stationed in Korea he met my Mom. A pretty common story, I've heard. But the result of them meeting was me. A beautiful baby. That... is not really beautiful there but my artistic skills are lacking. ANYWAY, regardless of all that I was born, and I was born awesome. And muscular. I was a gigantic baby apparently, which my mom reminds me of every once in a while. I was ten pounds and three ounces, and therefore they named me Mark. All muscle of course. DON'T DOUBT ME! Shortly after I was born my Dad retired from the military to pick up a job as a layout artist for a book company of some sort. But, either way we ended up in Cincinnati Ohio of all places. Not really sure why because I don't think we have any family here. Ah, either way we moved into this awesome home with a gigantic back yard that led into these really amazing woods where me and my brother spent most of our time. I mean, if we weren't on the computer we were in the woods playing in the creek, picking up tad-poles, cutting vines, swinging on them. I mean, we really bonded together in those woods and that's one of the things I miss most about that house, but when we weren't in the woods we were playing on this magical device called the computer that my Dad introduced us to at a very early age. I mean, seriously, this thing blew my mind at the time because I could not imagine ever living without it. I mean, he told me stories about how computers were ancient and filled up entire rooms but I was just flabbergasted that it could do what it did. I didn't even know about the internet back then. There were a few games on the computer but the REAL experience that I got from gaming came from the Super Nintendo system that my brother got for Christmas. I mean, this thing was the reason that me and my brother are so close today because we played so many games together with it. That's my brother over on the left. His name is Tom, and that's me on the right as you can tell I'm still more awesome but he's a pretty cool guy and I don't think I'd be who I am today without him. Sadly it wasn't all happy times back then. My Dad and my Mom fought a lot. And by fought a lot I mean my Mom fought a lot and my Dad had to reciprocate. Um, she wasn't happy were she was and, well, we didn't understand why but me and my brother just tried to distract ourselves with video games. You know, try to ignore it when we can. But eventually that stopped working. It was pretty inevitable but the divorce finally came. And we were pretty sad but we were more sad to see our Dad just kind of cave in, I mean, we were out of money. Half of the income was gone so we had to loose the house and we couldn't buy as many games as we had before so we lost out on a lot of gaming but at least we got to keep the computer and that's what really sparked my love of computers and technology. I should also mention that I was a pretty dumb kid. Me and my brother had a contest where we would try to jump as high as we could off the stairs and see who could land on a cushion on the bottom. I was gonna win but I ended up cracking my skull open on the bottom step. This will make more sense later, but as I mentioned before, I was a DUMB kid. When we moved out of the house, I could no longer go to the private school that we were going to which was perfectly fine with me, because I didn't really care, but it's all that I knew. I didn't even understand what lockers were all about when I went to the new school. I mean, just everything was perfectly foreign to me and I didn't have an escape, I didn't go to the woods anymore, and I lost pretty much all of my friends and had to start all over. It was a pretty dark time for me because I had no idea what I was doing. But, anyway, I made some friends but I accidently did something else stupid and I was having a ""How far off the monkey bars can you jump contest"" and I was gonna win... but I ended up falling on the ground... and breaking my arm like, really badly, both bones and stuff popping out everywhere BUT this is actually a good thing, (that's my brother there shocked) but this is a good thing because this led to me finding some friends, and you may ask, ""Well, how did that happen?"" Well it happened like this, I had a cast on my arm and I couldn't do things like sharpen my pencil. So this really awesome guy named Drew decided that he was gonna help me. And Drew is a tall red head but he was a cool guy anyway. He also got me more into band. Which is where I made a bunch more friends. And where I blew his face off with my awesome trumpeting skills. HUCHA! Eventually after dating around for a long time my Dad found someone that we could all agree on, she was pretty much the nicest person we ever met and her name was Dee. And, I mean, I agreed with her because she bought us a Playstation 2, and I was pretty excited at the time, but also she did something that we couldn't do at that time and she made my Dad happy. And that was pretty much the most important thing that anyone could do. And, from then on High School started to become a breeze. I was moving through the grades, you know, doing fine, being a good student. I made a lot of great friends, both in band and out of band. I got to play some great games, you know. I was really happy with what I'd done, like, Half Life 2 and stuff. And I had a few girlfriends here and there, you know. And that's always pretty fun when you're just a young teenager first experiencing the wonders of a relationship and making out and stuff. That was pretty cool. And all in all things were looking up from that period where we didn't really have anything and didn't have games again, and were kind of unhappy drifting through life, so, things were looking up all the way to going to college. I was really excited to finally be able to go out on my own. But then, my father brought me some bad news. He put a piece of paper in front of me and just let me read it without saying anything, and I was a pretty smart kid so I understood every word that it said, all the techno mumbo jumbo, but the main thing is that basically in big bold letters it said, ""CANCER"", and the really bad kind of cancer. So, that was a really tough time for me because I kind of lost sight of what I was doing. Everything seemed kind of clear to me before but right now everything was kind of just getting away from me. I thought I knew exactly what I wanted to do, which was make video games. I wanted to do it, and my Dad didn't agree with me, but I thought that was what I was going to do. However, I started to realize that games might not work, so I kind of put that off the table and focused on going to engineering. I was originally in civil engineering but moved into bio-medical engineering because they had a medical school program but that didn't work out either. I didn't want to do that. So I flip-flopped back to engineering again. Then I thought, ""Hey, if I'm going to do what I want to do, I got to do games. "" And I really couldn't decide what I was going to do with my life. I was kind of at a cross roads and just frustrated. Then one year later we were all home for summer and my Dad was getting pretty bad with cancer and he wasn't himself anymore. But one morning we were all woken up by my step-mom, Dee, screaming and we went down stairs to see that my Dad was dying. And the last words that he said to me were ""I love you, so much"". And I held my Dad's hand as he died. After my Dad died I became more confused than I was before. Because I was so far into engineering that I didn't think that I could get out anymore and I was stuck in these mind-numbing co-op jobs that were literally me sitting at a computer eight hours a day doing two hours worth of work and nothing else. It was absolutely horrible and I didn't want to do that for the rest of my life. And I didn't have time for games. I didn't have an escape. I had no idea what I was going to do, so I kind of drifted for a few years. And I dated in and out from girl to girl but I eventually met this one girl who I kind of liked and she was really cool and really nice, and her name will be.... Barbara. That's what we're going to call her for now. Her name will be Barbara with a C. But anyway, I finally brought her to my Mom who I was living with because after my Dad died I didn't have my own place and she did not approve which made me mad. And she was kind of confused. I was very upset because my Mom got so mad that she eventually kicked me out. There's more to it than that but that's basically the long and the short of it. So I got mad and she got mad and then I went off and got my own apartment because I had a job at the time, that crummy co-op job, but it was still a job. Unfortunately, after I got my new place my boss told me three days before I was supposed to come in for the new quarter that I didn't need to show up. Which made me more mad, but I didn't yell at my boss, professionalism and all that, but at the end of the day I was running out of money and my girlfriend wasn't helping me and then she started getting mad at me for not being able to do something or other, I can't really remember why she was mad, she was mad so often, but eventually this caused a schism in the relationship, and the stress started to get to me. I was sadder and sadder than I was before and I just couldn't be in the relationship anymore but, after we left each other I was stuck alone in my apartment and I didn't know what to do. And I had this suspicious pain in my side that turned into extraordinary pain in my side. And this extraordinary pain plagued me for a bit until one day I woke up in so much pain that I had to go to the hospital. So I went to the hospital where they told me that my appendix was about the size of a beach ball and needed to come out immediately. They also told me that I had a tumor the size of a fist in my adrenal gland and that needed to come out too, but at a later date. So this was pretty shocking news and on top of everything that had happened already I was pretty much stressed enough as it is but I managed to truck through it somehow, thankfully for reconciling with my mom and my step-mom was still there for me. The surgeries went well and I ended up recovering in the hospital for about two weeks and had a lot of time to think about what I'd done. And the more thinking I did the more frustrated I became. Just, it seemed like everything in my life was completely out of my control and I had no choice in the matter. So finally I decided that enough was enough and I was going to do what I wanted. But I was still stuck in the hospital so I got angrier every day. ARGH! So when I finally did get out of the hospital I decided that I was going to do my own thing and what I decided what I was going to do was sketch comedy videos. So I ended up using my tax refund that I had to buy a camera. I ended up doing very little with this camera immediately. So I decided to focus on a few things before I got started. I got better with my grades in engineering. I decided to dedicate myself to playing games that I wanted to play, and the eventually I decided that I was going to make my own identity, on the internet, and more specifically, on YouTube. Where I was able to start a channel that finally made me happy. I didn't even care that I didn't have that many subscribers in the beginning because even the few people that did watch me I was more than happy to do everything it took to entertain them. But as I kept playing things started exploding. Like, the subscriber count went crazy and now I have more subscribers than I know what to do with. And I'm just happy that anyone watches my videos. And that's what really changed my life. And this happened very recently. Like, before I was totally out of control of everything. And now, I'm finally able to do what I love. So, Thank you guys. Sincerely. I owe everything in my life right now, to the support that you have given me. I was lost before. I had no purpose before. But now we're able to change the world, do good, raise money for chairty, do just everything we want to do to help improve the world. And I am so grateful that you guys decided that I was worthy enough to subscribe to. So, sincerely, thank you guys, so much. I owe you everything that I have now. And I wouldn't have it any other way. You guys are the best fans in the world. So, thank you again. So Much. And as always, I WILL SEE YOU, in the next video. BYE BYE!",13:38
5YBwDNfOaxU,ElectroBOOM,Science,Graphite and Its Awesome Properties,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YBwDNfOaxU,5 years ago,6.8M views,Science,"Hi. Graphite.
I like graphite! It's a specific arrangement
of carbon atoms that is highly conductive. Which also allows us to draw. Graphite has many applications.
From pencils, to DC motor brushes, to some traces on electronics, to battery carbon rods,
and more. This is a replacement lead
of a mechanical pencil. It's not made of lead, of course.
It's carbon. The reason they call it lead
is the result of the same ignorance that resulted in calling the
North American natives “Indians.“ You know, those early explorers,
when they found America, they thought they were in India,
so they called them “Indian”. Later, British tried to fix it
by eliminating natives, which they failed. So they took over India,
and tried to turn them into British, which they failed. Now, we have to call
the real Indians... ... East Indians, South Asian,
Asian Indian, or whatever, to avoid mixing them with natives, who were wrongfully accused of being Indian. Aaach! I wasn't even involved! The point is that, people were originally using lead to draw. So when they discovered graphite, they thought it does the same thing, so it must also be an Indian. One important note - the element of lead is highly poisonous, and I hate it! It turns you into an idiot before it kills you. But I like graphite. Now let's pass some current through the pencil lead. That way I can measure its resistance. Dogsh*t! Aah! Nowadays, everything blows up. Let's try again. Wow! It lights up well! Now I'm running 1 amp and measuring voltage across around 1 centimeter, so for this particular piece, the resistance is 150 milliohms, across 1 centimeter. And this is how they make potentiometers. Let's try 30 volt 10 amp. Just melted my alligator clip. Now, let's kick it up a notch. I'm gonna run 10 amps through a regular pencil's graphite. Wow! This is getting- Oh my god- Sh*t! @#$%! Whoa! @#$%&*%! @#$%*%#*@%&!*@#%@! Well see, the graphite gets super hot and burns the wood around it. But it doesn't burn. That's why it's good for high temperature applications. Let's run 10 amps through this graphite and see how much it glows. Yaaaaa! Look at this! Let me see if I can measure its temperature using my thermal camera. Wow, look at that! Right away it goes above the 330 degrees maximal- @#$%! By the way, I have four of these thermal cameras to give away at the end of my video. So these get very hot. Always wear safety gloves to protect your fingers, and don't try this at home. Let me see if I can make some arcs. Muuuh sh*t! Always wear safety goggles when dealing with very bright arcs. Let's try it again. Nice. Look at that! Nice. F*ck! Am I on fire?! (blow blow blow) I suppose using the gardening gloves is not the best idea. You can get carbon rods from a carbon zinc battery. Not an alkaline battery; its structure is different. Make sure it says ""carbon zinc"" or ""heavy duty,"" and it doesn't say ""alkaline"" or ""rechargeable."" First, you pull the cover off. Then you gently pull the battery rod out, while turning it like this. Now I have AA battery rods, D size battery rods, and some longer rods from my old 6 volt battery pack. And I have my supercapacitor bank. I doubled the number of capacitors so I can charge them to 30 volts that can deliver more than 200 amps. Let's make some arcs now. Hey - my rods are burning? Aah sh*t! Goggles! Well, it wasn't the rods apparently. It seems like there is some flux in them that eventually burns out. Let's see if we can melt some copper with this. Look at that people! Molten- Ah sh*t! This glove is not good for this purpose! (blow blow blow) Good news to my supporters at Patreon.com, I have four of these Seek thermal cameras to give away.

ElQdUHSXkME,The Infographics Show,Informative,Mad Jack - A Real Life World War 2 Mad Man,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElQdUHSXkME,3 years ago,8.5M views,Informative,"One rainy day in the mid 1930s, a peculiar
young officer smartly paraded up to the front of his platoon's formation and snapped into
place with full military precision. Unlike the rest of his platoon however, this
particular officer was carrying an umbrella. Red in the face with anger, and dripping wet
in the rain, the battalion adjutant immediately stormed over and demanded to know what in
the blue blazes the officer was thinking carrying an umbrella to formation. Without missing a beat, the young officer
simply responded, “because it's raining, sir.” John Malcolm Thorpe Fleming Churchill- or
as he would be later known, 'Mad Jack” or “Fighting Jack”- would be immediately
reprimranded for his insubordination and preposterousness, but such reprimands were nothing new for the
very bored officer. Amidst the brief interlude of peace between
World War I and World War II, Churchill found his military service, well, rather dull. A rare breed of man, practically born to lead
others on the battlefield, Churchill itched for excitement and chaos. When life failed to provide any, he sought
it out himself, and at a time when roads were mostly non-existent in India, rode his motorcycle
over 1500 miles of the South East Asian countryside, often crossing rivers and chasms by pushing
his bike along the rails of railroad tracks while he carefully stepped across the crossbeams. To ease his peacetime boredom, Churchill also
taught himself how to play the bagpipes, which at the time was not a particularly popular
pastime for proper British men. But not one to halfass anything, Churchill
not only learned to play the bagpipes, he would go on to place second in the officers'
class of the piping championships at Aldershot- a stunning feat considering he was the only
Englishman amongst the seventy or so competitors. Bagpipes mastered, Churchill also took up
a keen interest in archery, and became such a proficient archer that he would go on to
represent England in an international tournament. Churchill may have been a daredevil and adrenaline
junkie, but that didn't mean that he disliked comfort. Quite the opposite, not only would Churchill
earn himself a reprimand for bringing an umbrella to a military formation in the pouring rain,
but he was also chastised for using a hot water bottle to keep warm at night in his
cot, against military protocol. To bypass this minor technicality, Churchill
instead used a piece of rubber tubing which he filled with hot water- the regs after all
forbade the use of hot water bottles, but said nothing about rubber tubes. While most military men measure their alleged
toughness by their ability to suffer hardship, Churchill saw no need for such inane displays
of machismo- or perhaps he was, as many sources state, bored out of his mind by peace and
entertained himself by annoying his senior leadership. Whatever the truth, if anyone thought that
Churchill was a soft man because he preferred to stay dry in the rain and sleep in warm
comfort, they would be sorely mistaken as the world was about to find out with the outbreak
of World War II. In 1939 the German army invaded Poland from
one side as the Russians invaded from another, Polish defenders caught between the two surging
armies and quickly surrendering. The hostilities prompted Britain and France
to declare war on Germany, and at last Churchill's long stretch of peacetime boredom came to
an end. Commenting that, “I was back in my red coat;
the country having got into a jam in my absence”, Churchill left behind his brief peacetime
life of modeling and appearing in famous films as an extra to ship out to France. However upon arriving Churchill was immediately
disappointed- despite German aggression against the Poles and Britain and France's declaration
of war, both nations simply took up positions along the French Maginot line and did... well
nothing. Troops simply held their ground and generally
tried not to be bored for weeks upon weeks, the lack of offensive operations being the
result of Britain and France's lack of preparations for war. What historians would end up calling “a
slight oversight”, Britain and France had completely failed to fully prepare for conflict
despite years of ratcheting German aggression and a whole lot of angry, tiny-mustached chest-pounding
from Adolf Hitler. Whatever the case, Churchill found himself
a victim of Allied unreadiness, a situation which did not suit him at all. There was a war on, damn it, and like a puppy
straining at the leash, Churchill wanted his share of it. With the Soviets invading Finland, Churchill
joined a volunteer detachment of British soldiers sent to aid Finn forces- they might not be
Germans, but fighting anyone who was being an international dick was better than fighting
nobody Churchill supposed. Bidding his comrades audieu, Churchill joined
the Finnish detachment- but before the expedition could get all the way to Finland it was cancelled
on account of some sudden and very severe German rudeness across the entire Maginot
line. Finland would have to fend for itself against
the Soviets, at last the proper war was on. Returning to his comrades, Churchill was immediately
displeased at the British army's failure to hold its ground against the overwhelming German
blitzkrieg of tens of thousands of infantry, thousands of tanks, and an equal number of
fighters and bombers. Churchill and his unit were then ordered to
retreat, making for Dunkirk where rescue awaited for the overwhelmed British and French forces-
and if that rescue failed, the war could come to a very sudden and unpleasant end for the
allies. More than a fair bit annoyed at having to
retreat, Churchill decided to creatively reinterpret his orders, and rather than simply fall back
en masse, engaged in an aggressive campaign of guerrilla raids and counterattacks against
the German forces. Leading small teams of hand-picked men, Churchill
would rush roaring a battlecry into battle, holding aloft a large two-handed sword. Like some anachronistic Highlander, Churchill
waded into enemy fire and on more than one occasion spitted a German soldier on his claymore. Other times Churchill would discard his rifle
in favor of his longbow, sinking barbed shafts into the chests of Germans up to a hundred
yards away. Rumor has it that during one battle a German
officer asked for a list of casualties and injuries, only to be told that several of
the casualties had been shot with arrows. The confused and irate officer warned his
junior officer not to joke around with him, only to be shown the bodies with arrows still
sticking out of them. Professional soldiers always expect the unexpected
in combat, but nobody expected a mad Englishman shooting arrows in the midst of the greatest
industrial-age war in human history. During a lull in the fighting, Mad Jack Churchill
as he was now known, was spotted by a fellow officer riding his signature motorcycle, longbow
on his back, arrows sticking out of packs strapped to his body, and a german officer's
cap on the motorcycle's headlamp. As Mad Jack dismounted, the officer noticed
a streak of blood across his ear and neck, and asked about the fresh injury. Asking for a stiff drink in return, Churchill
responded that he and his men had ran into a German machine gun, and his men had screamed
for him to run, but he had simply been too tired to. Churchill had thought it simpler to destroy
the machine gun nest, even after being shot through the neck. Successfully making it across the channel
back to England, Churchill got wind of a new military organization being formed. Called Commandos, the request for volunteers
was secretive, but promised “aggressive military service”, which was more than good
enough for Churchill. The progenitors to Britain's modern special
forces, commando service included weeks of training in demolitions, firearms, infiltration,
and all matter of other topics which Churchill absolutely adored. During Commando training however Churchill
also met a woman, whom he would immediately marry and remain happily married to for 55
years until his death. On December 27th, 1941, Churchill had his
chance to rejoin the war as the newly formed Commandos assaulted the German garrison at
Vaagso in Norway. Tasked with destroying the onshore artillery
in preparation for a full-scale assault, Churchill stood in the lead landing craft with his bagpipes,
belting out The March of the Cameron Men as enemy machineguns strafed the oncoming boats. As soon as the ramps lowered, Churchill waded
ashore ahead of his men, holding aloft his sword and as one soldier put it, “uttering
warlike cries”. A half hour later, Churchill sent out a brief
telegraph to headquarters, reading simply: Maaloy battery and island captured. Casualties slight. Demolitions in progress. Churchill. Churchill would go on to win several military
honors, as well as more than a few battle scars, but his greatest feats of valor would
not come until the Autumn of 1943. Leading the allied landings at Salerno in
Italy, Churchill and his commandos found themselves fighting alongside American Rangers in the
town of Marina. Both Churchill's commandos and the American
Rangers were not designed to fight and operate as normal line infantry, lacking much of the
heavy fire support that normal infantry brings to a fight such as heavy machine guns and
mortars. Armed mostly with rifles and grenades so that
they could remain mobile, the commandos and Rangers found themselves at a severe disadvantage
as German and Italian heavy infantry assaulted their positions in waves. Though casualties were extremely high, the
allied forces beat back every assault. Growing bored of simply waiting for the Germans
to come to him to get shot, Churchill decided it would be best to go to where they were
instead and shoot them there. Ignoring the fact that he and his forces were
grossly outnumbered, had no heavy weapons, and absolutely zero support, Churchill led
a night raid against a heavily defended German position. Rushing out from thick undergrowth and shouting
“Commando!”, Churchill and his small detachment destroyed the German position and took 136
prisoners. Churchill and one of his corporals however
had managed to get themselves far ahead of the rest of their unit in the fighting, and
suddenly heard the sound of dozens of Germans digging into fighting positions all around
them in the nighttime darkness. Never one to waste a good opportunity, Churchill
decided that it wouldn't do to march back to friendly lines alone, and instead unsheathed
his giant sword and simply walked to the first German position, ordering the men to put their
hands up in German. Perhaps thinking themselves visited by the
ghost of an ancient medieval madman, or simply doubting that even their bullets would touch
a man with balls of steel so sturdy he waded into battle carrying a giant freaking sword,
the Germans obliged and were taken prisoner. Churchill however wasn't done, he thought
it wouldn't do for his German prisoners to be lonely, and thus decided to visit another
German position. By the end of the night, Churchill and his
corporal took 42 German prisoners, leading them back to British and American lines at
swordpoint. Churchill would go on to explain to a senior
officer that “as long as you tell a German loudly and clearly what to do, if you are
senior to him he will cry 'Jawohl!' and get on with it enthusiastically and efficiently
whatever the situation. That's why they make such marvelous soldiers.” A few months later however, Churchill would
himself be taken prisoner. Surrounded on all sides by Germans and with
just six men and himself left alive, and with nothing more than revolvers and a single American
carbine between them, Churchill fought on until the ammunition ran out and a mortar
killed three of his other men and wounded another. With nothing left to shoot back with, and
apparently separated from his trusty sword, Churchill pulled out his bagpipes and prepared
to meet his end, playing “Will ye no come back again” until a German grenade knocked
him unconscious. Churchill would be sent to a POW camp, but
quickly growing bored of not killing Germans, he hastily made an escape. Upon his recapture he was sent to an even
more well-guarded POW camp, only to escape again. Meeting up with a column of American armor,
Churchill was rescued but appalled to hear that the war was nearly over. Returning to his unit, Churchill commented
“there are still the Nips, aren't there?” and thus Churchill volunteered to ship off
to the Pacific. Sadly for Churchill, upon his arrival the
Americans dropped their second nuclear bomb and the Japanese quickly surrendered. A heartbroken Churchill would go on to say
to a friend, “if it hadn't been for those damned Yanks we could have kept the war going
for another 10 years.” Telling another friend that the Japanese had
double-crossed him by surrendering, Churchill immediately began to look for an opportunity
to join the many brush wars raging in the aftermath of World War II. He got his chance in 1948 when Arab forces
tried to drive the Jews from what would become Israel. Present in his full dress uniform at a battalion
parade, Churchill got news that a Jewish medical convoy had been ambushed by Arab forces. Not wasting a moment, Churchill immediately
rushed to their aid, still wearing full dress uniform. Boldly rushing down the middle of the road
and into the teeth of the battle, Churchill commented later that “I grinned like mad
from side to side, as people are less likely to shoot at you if you smile at them.” Churchill would go on to rescue 700 Jewish
civilians and earn greater military honors for his deeds. At the end of hostilities, Churchill then
went to teach at various military schools, ending his career while serving as an instructor
at the land-air warfare school in Australia. Giving up on its many attempts to kill him,
life would let Churchill live out his days happily next to his wife until his peaceful
death in 1996, leaving behind an extraordinary legacy of courage and... well no small amount
of lunacy. Best remembered for his signature claymore
which he waded into battle with, Churchill once answered a General awarding him a decoration
who asked about the weapon by saying, “In my opinion, sir, any officer who goes into
action without his sword is improperly dressed.” Was Mad Jack Churchill truly crazy, or just
insanely brave? Want to see stories about more historical

-You weren't. I was watching the taxi! Did your co-presenter just attack
you with a machete? Yes, he did. He was quite cross

It'll be fine. There you go. What a nice man. Soon, though,

7_e0CA_nhaE,Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell,Science,The World War of the Ants – The Army Ant,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_e0CA_nhaE,2 years ago,16M views,Science,"Some groups just don't get along. Every day, billions of soldiers fight a merciless war on thousands of fronts, and it's been going on for over 100 million years. The World War of the Ants. [Music] Ants are ancient beings that arose around 160 million years ago and took over a wide variety of ecological niches so successfully that they became one of the dominant animals on planet Earth. Today, they count more than 16,000 different species with over 10,000 trillion individuals. Collectively, ants alone make up 20% of the entire animal biomass on land. Similar to humans, their recipe for success is collaboration. While a single ant is pretty useless, together, they are able to achieve stunning feats. They construct complex colonies, care for livestock, pursue agriculture, or have complex symbiotic relationships. And of course, ants wage war. Even among the same species, a constant state of conflict is pretty common. Skirmishes, raids, and full-on invasions are happening every day, causing millions of casualties. Let's look at some of the most interesting ones in a series of videos. In this one, the army ant, a swarm made for war. The army ant group consists of about 200 different species. Army ants do not build nests; they live a sort of nomadic lifestyle with groups of millions of individuals. On a hunt, some species form large columns up to 100 metres long, killing and immediately dismembering every insect or small vertebrate they encounter. The biggest hunting parties can kill up to 500,000 animals per day. Some army ants specialize in hunting and consuming other social insects, like termites, wasps, and especially other ants. Wasps are fierce and may seem invulnerable, but if a swarm makes its way to their colonies, they don't even stand a chance. The much bigger and stronger wasps might kill a few of them, but they are quickly overwhelmed. Even if their queen survives an attack, the army ants steal the colony's larvae and quickly devour them. There is no recovery from that. When army ants discover another ant colony, they immediately attack. Now you might think this would be a more even battle, but it's not. Because army ants act as a social unit, they are especially dangerous and effective. Most army ants are not particularly impressive individually, but they can overwhelm their victims with sheer numbers before the victim colony can mount an effective defense. And so invasions tend to be won by the attackers, and the prey colony is damaged significantly or is exterminated. Interestingly, army ants don't fight army ants. When two swarms encounter each other in the wild, they either pass through each other, ignoring the other swarm, or both colonies just move away, which makes sense from an evolutionary standpoint. Army ants that fought other army ants probably eradicated themselves millions of years ago. Indeed they're so deadly that other ant species had to specialize to survive their presence. Many species just panic and evacuate their nest when they notice army ant scouts, carrying as many larvae with them as they can, in order to return and rebuild after the attack. Other species have invented living bunkers since fighting is so futile. They have worker classes that have big square heads. When army ants show up, they use them to block the entrances to their nests, so the attackers have to give up after a while. But not everybody is afraid of army ants. Leafcutter ants form some of the largest and most complex societies of any animal other than humans. They live in extensive nests, many meters deep and across, harboring millions of citizens with a highly sophisticated division of labor. Like huge soldiers, 100 times more massive than a worker. Their sole purpose might be to defend their colonies against army ants. They still have a nemesis though. The diet of the army ant species Nomamyrmex esenbeckii consists mostly of the larvae of other ants. Compared to other army ants, they have a more robust soldier caste. So far, they are the only known species that can successfully attack a mature colony of leafcutters. When they find a leafcutter colony, hundreds of thousands attack in a long column. The moment the leafcutter ants notice the army ant attack, they go into crisis mode and immediately alert their soldiers, who very quickly swarm to the site of attack. A frontline develops that can be a few meters wide and up to a meter deep. The leafcutter soldiers go head-to-head with the army ants, locking on them and trying to cut through their heads. Smaller leaf cutter workers help by grabbing the enemies. Small teams carry out attacks behind the frontline, where they dismember their enemies by ripping their legs from their bodies. The attackers meanwhile try to swarm their victim's soldiers, and sting them to death in a mob. Despite the powerful defense and the determined response, the army ants are still superior in numbers. So without knowing if the battle can be won, the leafcutters prepare for the worst. Workers rush to create barricades and seal off as many entrances to their nest as possible to secure their route. If the leafcutters are not able to repel the invaders, or at least barricade enough of their entrances in time, the army ants swarm the nest, overrunning all opposition. They penetrate deep into the hidden chambers and steal tens of thousands of the leafcutters' brood to eat them. Even if the leaf cutter colony survives, this is a heavy blow. Regardless who's won the war, thousands lay slain on the battlefield. When the army ants attack, death follows them. But there are other species that form much more dangerous ant armies. Species that form supercolonies covering thousands of square kilometers over multiple continents engaging in wars kilometers across. They deserve their own video though. No matter the scale, war is a part of ant existence. Be it between huge colonies, or small groups trying to fend off a raid. In tropical rainforests, but also in the cracks of the concrete we walk over every day. Humans have decided that war is not a thing that they want to do a lot anymore. For ants though, the other ant will always be the enemy. No, some groups just don't get along.

This is shaping up to be the biggest year for unicorn IPO, so you are seeing some egg to private stock market side equity at 7.2. Billion dollars or a little over six billion dollars for trading My name is Jonathan mAh people call me Joma, and I'm starting a startup Yeah, well I've always worked for companies like Facebook, Microsoft You know big tech companies And I always had this itch of starting something on my own so after working for BuzzFeed the idea of a startup Like it was growing on me. You know every day. I just kept thinking about it, and I couldn't stop At the point where like my visions were so vivid that it was almost like reality so about this vision Can you talk to me a little bit more about that like? What is your startup idea? Yeah, it's uh. It's a it's a tech startup and Well why man just started so I don't have Coming up with a startup idea usually starts with a problem And that problem Is your one you have yourself, so that's why today? We're gonna be thinking about phones now according to Paul Graham the co-founder of the seed capital firm Y Combinator best startup ideas tend to be something that founders want and Something that can build themselves so what are the advantages of choosing a problem you have yourselves well first and foremost it ensures the problem really exists and Second of all it makes it a lot easier for you to develop empathy for your users Another important aspect is how much do users need your product? It's better to have a few people who absolutely need your product than having a lot of people who might want your product obviously You want to build something that reaches a lot of people, and they really need it But most of those ideas are already implemented like Google for searching the web That's why having a well-defined problem that real people have is vital for coming up with a killer startup idea However this requires some research planning finding potential stakeholders, though These are crucial steps for building a successful startup Sometimes as an engineer you just can't help yourself, but to start building So today we were going to Stanford We're gonna go see one of my friends. I'm gonna see if he's uh If he's interested in working with me He's just a sophomore, but he's a very talented individual Stanford home of the unicorn startups the Gryffindor of universities the smarter brother of UCB what not to love look at that grass Imagine feeding that grass to a cow and then eating that cow oh, man Brendan I'm Brendan Tron.

I study symbolic systems my doodoo is software stuff is this your room This is messy I know Joe after working at BuzzFeed with him I was an intern there this summer and he hung out with the interns a lot anyways so yeah I came here to ask you a couple of question because uh I she want to talk to you about something He came over here to talk to me about a project you want to work on I got started updating as you know If you saw my video, I'm sorry sir.

Oh, sorry So yeah, so it's pretty exciting um I'm pretty excited about it Yeah, whoa, well I mean like I don't have like a full third idea yet and like I'm still kind of like where Honda Like one of the reasons why I don't want to talk about it. It's like I don't really think I should talk about it You know on camera so so I think okay, so I'll just tell you like now okay? Yes we It's kind of shitty idea But I think Joe is a pretty smart, dude, so We'll see Like okay like would you use it for example I? Doubt it okay fine, but you're not the target demographic you know, but yeah Not only you're not okay, well, I mean obviously you're not sis you don't think you use it But like imagine if it does succeed think about how awesome it is You know oh, yeah, it's a where is that succeed it would be really cool It would be pretty epic like I could teach you. Yeah, like you don't always want to be the co-founder of something Especially in this space where it's like It's a hit, or miss it could just be the headline like right. Yo this startup kind of sucks personally I do want you to drop out You know because you do know that people who drop out of Stanford.

means its value soars by the time it's reached Europe its price has gone up nine times if users love it the cartels love it even more Mexican meth can be on America's streets two days after it's produced here [Music] crystal meth has emerged as a lucrative business for the cartels they franchise out its production to small gangs then gathered in and export but the cartel leaders realized their trusted system of widespread but small-sized production simply wasn't meeting ever-growing market demand from the meth hungry United States so they changed gear and the concept of the super lab

Sinaloa cartel because they've invited us to see a meth SuperLab in action and on arrival we learned that Mexico's anti-narcotics military units were making sweeps of known gang areas it meant there would be delays for three nights we followed the cartels instructions touring around the city parking up and waiting for their signal that the lab was on one of the reasons why the cartels are so successful and have lasted for so long is that they take security incredibly seriously our meetings with them have taken months to organize but now we're here they actually take many more hours to get to we get moved from different locations it's clear they're watching seeing if we're being followed checking out if we are being honest and that that we are indeed journalists we've now been told to come and stay behind this petrol station and to stay in their cars they're going to come back soon to take us to the next meeting finally word came that the gang had secured the area around the lab and we were ordered to follow this car to the next location we weren't told if it would be the lab or another holding area guarded by dozens of cartel members we were taken to a warehouse [Music] they cook in huge drums fixing the chemical ingredients they barely speak to avoid identification [Music] production on this scale will take days the risk of detection increasing with every hour a stay and work in one place the production of crystal meth on an industrial scale bought something of a narco revolution to Mexico what was once produced in the back of campervans is now producing huge quantities and makes huge profits for the cartels they were so convinced that their quality of their product would be good that they gave it away to America for free they were convinced the United States would become hooked where they were right it's extremely toxic and on this scale the chances of an explosion are incredibly high the cookers are wary moving back and forth as the ingredients react spewing stinking gas into the air well while this is a big operation it's interesting the security they do it in different locations so the cartel has a number of warehouses and houses and disused shops that they use for the production of their methamphetamines and other things like crack as well so we've come from one location we're now being sent to another to continue filming with the increase in demand and the ability to produce in vast quantities at home from scratch the cartels look to expand production they realized they'd struck gold white gold for the next 48 hours straight this gang will work to fill thousands of capsules with crystal meth before it's moved abroad this amount will clear the cartel a quarter of a million pounds in profit most importantly they can do this every week it's staggering this one lab is making 12 million pounds a year and it's a medium-sized operation how long will you stay doing it do you think I am this I don't have I don't

UCq_cDPeY1k,Insider News,News,Vineyard Workers Race Overnight To Save Grapes From Approaching Fires | California Wildfires,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCq_cDPeY1k,,522K views,News,"Narrator: Workers at this
vineyard in Sonoma County rush to harvest 10 tons of grapes
off the vine late at night. That's because the second largest
fire in California history was burning just one mile away. - Oh ----. That's getting close. That just came up, huh? Yeah, that's scary. This isn't a typical pick, because the grapes aren't
really ripe enough. Narrator: It's a scene that's unfolding across California's wine industry. In recent years, winemakers have been forced to make a difficult decision — salvage what they can before
smoke ruins their grapes, or lose the crops and hope
insurance will cover the losses. Since August 15, over 1.6 million acres in
California have burned, an area about the size of
the entire state of Delaware. Scientists say this year could likely mark the state's worst ever wildfire season. It's a devastating sequel to 2019, when the season's worst
fire, Kincade, destroyed over 100 buildings,
including local landmarks like the Soda Rock winery in Healdsburg. - Yeah, it's just a
larger question of like, what's going to happen going forward. This is three out of four years
now that we're doing this. Narrator: And as the fires burn, there are fears that the
ongoing coronavirus pandemic could spread among agricultural workers. In a normal year, the
end of summer would mark the beginning of harvest in wine country. Nearly 15 million tourists visit Sonoma and Napa counties annually,
pumping about $4 billion into wineries, hotels and restaurants. - Right now is
the most critical time for the industry and our
business and our county. Our county depends on
agricultural, specifically grapes, wine grapes and wine growing, and so we're unable to do that or execute that because of
weather or whatever it is. That's going to have a dramatic
effect on this community. Narrator: Ross Reedy has
worked in the wine industry for 12 years as a wine
grower and a winemaker. He's seen how fires have
changed the landscape over the years. - Ten years ago, I remember
walking through a vineyard and looking at it and say,
""Oh yeah, we've got two weeks until that's ready."" And you can pick based on ripeness and the physiology of the grape. Now the past three or
four years, it's like, oh OK, well, fire
is still 20 miles out, the wind's moving the opposite direction. OK, I got another week, you know. Narrator: In the vineyards, the actual threat from fire is low. In fact, fields like this one are typically a good fire defense for the
buildings they surround. It's smoke that is the problem. - The reason for that is
something called smoke taint. So you know, if you have
smoke that sits in a vineyard over a period of time, it latches onto the skins and the sugar. It actually creates like
very heavy barbecue-ashtray kind of characteristics in the wines. Depending on what the winds
do and what this fire does, there's a real big chance that
we're not going to be able to harvest fruit this year,
which would be really bad. Narrator: Some vineyards
are just one last crop away from their business coming to an end. - First of all, it hurts the grower. This particular grower has
insurance, it'll cover his costs. So it basically, he doesn't
make any money this year, he limps along. I mean, if he was in dire
straits, could potentially ruin, kill his business. Narrator: Hotter, drier
conditions are becoming part of a new normal in California. Although last year the Kincade Fire started because of faulty electrical equipment, this year's combination
of a searing heat wave and rare summer lightning
storms have kicked off what scientists predict could
be a catastrophic fire season. Winemakers are trying their best to adapt, but there are many complications. The power at Emmitt-Scorsone
Wines was out for one week. - We evacuated from here,
we got out what we could. We knew at some point
the power would be cut. The immediate concern is
the temperature control in our cellar. We had no time at all to
plan a full evacuation of 150 barrels of wine, so we decided, just — We had one truckload. We took our six most expensive
barrels in hope for the best. Narrator: Last year, the
100-year-old Soda Rock winery was destroyed by the Kincade Fire. They were able to reopen, but the future of the
business remains uncertain. - Well, what a weird season, huh? Narrator: Some vineyards
have crop insurance, but it rarely covers all losses. That puts growers like Ross in a bind. Harvest what they can and risk that the wine made from them will have an unpleasant smoke flavor, or let them rot on the vine
and file an insurance claim. And it means asking field
workers to brave rough conditions in the midst of an ongoing pandemic. A July study revealed that
California agricultural workers are three times more likely
to contract the virus compared to workers in other sectors. Corazon Healdsburg, a local nonprofit, has
been distributing food since the pandemic began. Today, they are doing free
COVID testing for the community. Many here are agricultural
workers and families. - So, for those
who work in the vineyards, many commute together for work, many live together in the same households or in communal bunk houses. If somebody is infected
with COVID, that could really have a huge impact on the whole operation, and so that's why this testing
is so important right now. OK, so you're just
going to wait right here. We are seeing a
disproportionate impact of COVID on our Latino community. I think it is exacerbated
by the working conditions, of living conditions of
the Latino community here. Narrator: Despite these challenges, winemakers are taking steps
to protect their workers and their grapes. Organizations are providing
safety information on fires and COVID, and labs are being set up to
test for smoke taint in grapes. But many growers, like Palmer Emmitt of Emmitt-Scorsone wines, are optimistic about
the industry's future. - Hopefully this is not going
to be an annual occurrence, but you know, Sonoma County and the wine industry are
very resilient as a whole, and I think we'll survive
and keep chugging. Narrator: In the wee
hours of Sunday morning, Ross Reedy's crew finished
their emergency pick. - It is now 1:30.
We're back at the winery and just brought all this fruit back. It's been a pretty wild day. We got about 10 tons of rosacea
zinfandel out of Dry Creek. And you know, it's not ideal. We would have loved to have turned this into a still red wine, but you got to do what you got to do. Tomorrow is a new day — a whole new set of circumstances that are going to be
difficult to navigate through, but, you know, that's the
way it goes right now.",7:44

(upbeat Americana music) Welcome to Food Fears where I make something you hate taste great. You might recognize my
guest from his appearance on Lopez Tonight, it's Link Neal. - (chuckles) Okay.
- Welcome Link. - That's how we're gonna start this huh? - Have you done other things? I'm really only familiar
with your Lopez Tonight. - That's the last thing I remember. - Well thank you for being here. You may or may not know what you're in for a little bit. - Whenever you and a
food helmet are involved, I get nervous. - So I've watched you gag
and spit up on so many foods over the years and I
really hope you don't gag on the final dish I'm
about to make you today because we are eating, we're
eating, it's penis, yeah. We're eating penis.
- That is a, that's a wiener. - This is from a bull so
it is technically kosher, if you're worried about that. - [Link] Why is it rolled
up like Fruit By The Foot? - That's what all penises look like. So you've eaten penis a lot on the show. - Josh?
- What? - Okay, you know what, yes, that is what all penises look like. - Okay so you've eaten
penis a lot of times on the show, you never seem to enjoy it. You seem kinda scared of it. What about the penis
scares you in particular? - (clears throat) Mine even scares me. Have you seen it?
- No. - That wasn't an offer. Well, oh man look at that angle. - The more angles you look at it, the worse it's gonna get. - Yeah it's just not the thing that, it's not the thing that when you're hungry you find yourself
craving, at least not me. - That's my goal. I am hoping to get you to
fall in love with the penis. (laughs) But first we need to try
the penis in its pure, raw form so I've just simply--
- Keep saying penis. When I was a child, I called it a peeto. - A peeto, if it'd make
you more comfortable, I can say we have to eat
this boiled peeto right now. - You're saying we're gonna eat this. - Yeah, I need to get a
flavor profile to know how to build the flavors in my dish to try and get you to
love this so I will try and take a bite with you. - That doesn't make any sense, okay. Okay yeah, oh, you want me
to have the curly-cue one. - I think you should try the tip. - This is your show, I
don't know what you do. - Yeah no we're supposed to
just gingerly touch our tips. - Okay.
- The skin right there, there's some hairs attached but the skin right there's gonna
be your filet mignon penis. - Oh. (coughs) It smells like a wet dog. - Yeah, mm-hmm. This is where pee comes from. It's probably the reason. I like the way he's
using his tongue with it. - It's unchewable. - Wow. - There's no way, Josh. There's no way that I can even. (coughs) - Maybe just try and get the flavor. - There's no way I can describe it that won't have a double meaning. - Yeah we're into it.
- It's difficult. It's so hard, it's so stiff.
- It's so hard and so stiff and that means that I am coming up against some stiff challenges to try and get you to like this. - Yeah I don't even know how
you're gonna make it dineable. - That's for me to figure out. If you come back in a hour or so, I'll have a fully prepared
beautiful penis dish for you to eat. - There's some right here on my diastema. (upbeat country music) - There are three keys to success in life: hard work, determination,
and cleaning your penis. And we're really only gonna
hit that third one today. We're gonna slice a knife
down the center of the urethra to expose it and then we're gonna run that under cold water while
massaging it to really get any trace of urine out. Now that our penises are clean,
we can pressure cook them. We're just gonna toss in
an onion, toss in a lemon, salt, a little peppercorn,
a bunch of oregano, then in go our little bouquet of penises. Cook well, penises. Then we're gonna set that to
45 minutes on high pressure on the Instant Pot, and then ready to go. I'm not going to be making
a traditional pizza sauce per se but it is a traditional
Italian tomato sauce that is typically with a dish called bucatini all'Amatriciana
from the town of Amatrice and so it typically starts
with cured pork gel. I'm gonna substitute the
penis for the pork gel. It's very fatty that gets sauteed in oil. Now your penis is nice and crispy, you're gonna add all your
aromatics, so that means onion, right into the penis pan, garlic, crushed red pepper, and
then you're just continue to saute for a couple minutes. You can see that all
incorporating really beautifully. That's one of the best-looking
penises I've seen in awhile. Crushed tomato, and then,
just a little bit of sugar just to kinda neutralize that acidity, and then this is just gonna
cook down for about 10 minutes and then you have a really
beautiful penis sauce to go on your penis pizza. Next up, penis pesto. How many times can I say penis? Find out on the next
episode of penis penis. My strategy to combat the
fatty texture of that penis is to hit it with a lot of
bright and herbaceous ingredients which is why I'm making a penis pesto and I don't think those
words have ever been uttered in succession in human existence so that's really exciting for me. So we're just gonna start by
throwing a bunch of basil, some olive oil in there. We got garlic, we got
pecorino, we got pine nuts, and then just a little bit
of lemon for that acid. And then we're just gonna pulse this. (mixer whirs) So we're just gonna dump that into a bowl and then what we have here
is a bunch of bull penis that's been braised and just diced up into really tiny pieces. We're gonna fold that right into there. Yum. The third way I'm incorporating
penis into the dish is gonna be via a penis Parmesan powder which is gonna be actually
fried braised penis chunks. They're gonna turn
almost like chicharrones so super crispy, then
I'm gonna bash those up and turn it into a powder,
combine it with Parmesan, oregano, a little bit of garlic, crushed red pepper and then mix it all up and there you got your crunchy
garlic Parmesan penis powder. You know penis powder, just like you get at your local mom and
pop pizza penis shop. Mom and penis pizza pop shop. Penis pizza mom and pop pizza penis. Now we just have to make the
pizza which is really strange because of all the things
that we've done before this. The final pizza obviously
starts with the dough and I'm kinda of influenced by Pizza Hut's original pan crust here and so we press it into the pizza pan, then the
all'Amatriciana penis sauce goes on top, spread that around evenly. And I'm gonna take some fresh mozzarella and you're just gonna start
ripping it into chunks and throwing it on there. Stuff in a bag is super processed. The stuff sitting in
water, too much moisture. You bake it, then a little bit of dusting of that crunchy penis Parmesan powder, then you top it with your
beautiful, bright penis pesto. And that's the final pizza. (funky music) All right Link, I present to you the Parmesan penis pesto pizza. So we have penis that's been
braised and then actually mixed into the sauce, you can
see the chunks right there. We've mixed little penis
bits into the pesto and then there's a crunchy penis Parmesan garlic powder on top. This has penis three ways all in one of America's favorite foods the pizza. - So you're telling me
that that big chunk, that big chunk, those are
cross-sections of the thing. - Yeah the peeto. - There's penis in the green stuff. - It's chopped up very fine
so the penis actually absorbed some of the pesto, gives
you little penis flavor pops in the mouth. - Yeah, I mean it looks good. I would have thought that it's a pizza with big round chunks of onion. - Nope. - And that's how I'm gonna think of it. - Penis. Yeah. - I'm gonna say onion. - I know, just big ol'
chunks of penis on there. They say you eat penis
with your eyes first. It's an old chef saying.
- Who is they? - (laughs) It's an industry term. - All right so I'm eating
it with my eyes first. - I'll go ahead and join you on this. - Yeah we're gonna go in
on this penis together. - Uh uh uh, gingerly touch our tips. It's tradition on the show. - Tip it and dip it.
- Tip it and dip it, baby. - All right so I'm gonna eat
this whole chunk of onion. - It's not onion, it's penis. (soft music) - I'm really focusing on the
bread part, like the crust. - Yeah.
- The crust is very good. - Thank you. - But the big globule of penis-- - You can definitely
tell it's not an onion. - It's so chewy. But it doesn't have a bad taste. - It's not bad, it's pretty neutral. You have some brightness in the pesto. You're not gonna throw up. (exhales) There it is.
- I took a full bite. - And how do you feel? - I feel a bit compromised. I feel a bit taken advantage of, but I don't feel horrible. There's not another big bouncy ball. - I can get you one if you want. - Thank you.
- You're welcome. - What is that made out of? What is that? Is it rubber? - That? It's a bull penis made out of rubber. No a bull penis is made out of penis. - But what is it though, it's not meat. - I don't know, no it's not. Someone just Google what
a penis is real fast? - It's elastic. - It is.
- It's elastic rubber. - It's the weirdest conspiracy
theory you have but-- - I'm gonna eat it again.
- Please. (upbeat music) - You're just eating
unfettered penis over there. - Unfettered penis is
the best kind sometimes. Do you feel like you're
no longer as afraid of penises as you were
when you came into this? - I wouldn't say, I haven't
been afraid of penis. - You just said that. - I've been afraid of eating penis. - And do you feel like
you've had a change of heart? - That crunchy stuff penis? - Yeah, there's several
textures of penis on here. (clears throat) (chuckles) - You know what? I think I'm comin'
around to the long dong. You know? It's still kind of the
worst pizza I've ever had. - That's fair enough and there's a Little
Caesars right over here. - (chuckles) Right. Gotta give it to you Josh. You made penis into a pizza. (blows breath) - The penis breath is
strong after the pizza. Thank you guys so much for watching and come back next week
to see if I can get Stevie to sink her teeth into some pig uterus. And let me know in the comments what food freaks you out the most.",10:14

-53kaP6dZeI,SmarterEveryDay,Science,STRAPPED INTO A SINKING HELICOPTER (with U.S. Marines) - Smarter Every Day 201,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-53kaP6dZeI,3 years ago,19M views,Science,"(helicopter flying) (alarm systems beeping) - [Instructor] Ditching,
ditching, ditching. (water rushing) - So, I'm alive. (laughs) All right, here's the deal. My last mission as a U.S.
government civil servant was in a helicopter off
the coast of Hawaii. We'll learn about that
in a future episode, but this video's different. This is not like Destin's
going to go explore a thing and make an internet video about it, this is an actual training scenario that I was assigned,
and I had to go through in order to get certified
to accomplish my mission. Let's think about an
airplane crash in water. When an airplane lands on the water, you got these two long wings on the side that kind of serve as pontoons, and they keep the airplane upright. Up is up, down is down. You usually see on the news where people are walking
out over the wings and they're waiting on
boats to pick them up, and stuff like that. Helicopters are different, in a helicopter you've got these heavy engines up top, and no matter what, if you
land that engine weight is going to cause the
helicopter to flip over and you're going to start to sink. The point of this training
is to survive that scenario, and marines go through it all the time. People at off-shore oil
rigs, this is an important piece of training that will save lives. This is my instructor, Corey Catlett. He's trained helicopter pilots for years supporting oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, but today he's training me along with a class of young U.S. marines. Training started off dead
serious right out of the gate. They show us a fatal helicopter crash and explain the
environment that the people inside the helicopter are going through. After that, Corey explained the techniques and equipment that you would use to get out of a situation like this. For example, he explained this thing called the ""rodeo grip"" and how you have to anchor yourself to the seat. He explained how it's important to exhale all the way to the surface of the water so that your lungs don't explode when you're rising up and
you've got Boyle's law going on. It's a very serious environment, and you have to use
science, and knowledge, and understanding to get out of it safely. We took an exam to make sure we understood everything he was talking about, and then the next day at sunrise
we headed off to the pool. Are you guys nervous? - Oh, no we're good. (marines laughing) - [Destin] You're good? - Yeah. - [Destin] I feel like
everybody's acting like you're not nervous but you're all nervous. - My philosophy is that you all
gotta die some time or later and I guess this is the time to do it. (laughing) - I can't swim. - [Destin] You can't swim at all? Can I get a show of
hands of who can't swim? - We got somebody that can't swim? (Destin laughing) You can't swim? - Not really. - [Destin] So you guys are not
allowed to be buddies, right? Because one of you, that's awesome. So are you scared? - Eh, terrified. - Okay, so I'm gonna get to get in that. Which is a little
intimidating if I'm honest. Well before they strap
you into a helicopter you first have to learn how
to be upside down underwater, and let water flood your sinuses. When you first get in this tipping device the tasks are pretty simple. The first thing you do is grab the seat between your legs in what's
called the rodeo grip, and then you find the exit, grab it, unbuckle your seatbelt,
and then pull yourself out. After you get good with that, they make it a little bit more
difficult by adding a hatch that you had to break free of, and then eventually they
add the full regulator, so you're breathing before you exit. - I didn't know we were gonna do this, I thought we were actually
going to get right in. - I didn't either. - I'm kinda glad they're
actually taking steps to actually show us how to
do all these little things before we actually go to the helicopter. - Yeah it's like crawl,
walk, run isn't it? I've got to be honest about this part. I have an Advanced Open
Water Scuba Certification, so I'm used to breathing off a regulator. So, while the marines were over there learning how to breathe off a
regulator for the first time, I thought I was just gonna
walk up and flip upside down, and breathe naturally, and
it wasn't gonna be a problem. I was very wrong. Every time I've ever been scuba diving I've had this type of mask
on that covers your nose. The problem is when you
don't have that mask on, and you flip upside down, water floods into your nose
and fills your sinuses, and the last thing your body wants to do in that moment in time is take a breath. He was holding me down there
and encouraging me to breathe, which was challenging
because I had to overcome my mental fear of inhaling water, while at the same time
clearing a regulator and taking a life-giving breath. This was the hardest part
of the training for me. (Destin coughing up water) - It sucks getting all the
water up the nose, right? (Destin laughing) - It's worse than I thought. It's the nose thing isn't it. - It is, and that's what gets people to push that panic button. - [Destin] This is the simulator. It contains every escape
hatch that's common on Marine Corps aircraft,
and it's super intimidating. Everybody here's trying
to be tough and all, but it's a helicopter going underwater. It's pretty intimidating. - Ditching, ditching, ditching. (machine whirring) (water splashing) - Holy cow. The first dunk is the craziest. Because everybody's freaking
out just a little bit. For example, you can see this marine right here has lost his bearings. He's out of his seat, he's turned around, he's no longer got his reference point. Everything gets so chaotic
that the safety diver ditches my camera to swim
in and start saving people. - Yeah only one passed on that one. They lost reference points. They ended up releasing
their seat belts first and then trying to get their flack off, and it's just like a
loose sock in the dryer. If you don't put your butt
in the seat what happens? - You get lost, and I got lost. - Yeah, you get lost. Think about walking through your house with everything upside down, you're not gonna know
where the doorways are, you're not gonna know where anything is. - By the way, think about
what these instructors are going through on every run. They have to look and be aware
of everything that's going on in the midst of this crazy environment, find out the person that's in trouble, figure out how to help
them, and do it quickly. And if they don't do that somebody could be injured or even die. This is a serious job
for these instructors. (Marines cheering) - Calm yourselves and focus
on what we're doing here. We're trying to keep you alive if you crash at sea, right? So focus on that. - It's a pretty serious job you have here. - Well, it's high-risk training. There's a chance of death, huh? In high risk training. Hey the diver's are ready! - [Instructor] Ditching,
ditching, ditching. - [Yellow shirt instructor] Ditch-ing! (machines whirring) - Because you're just
watching this on video it's really hard to explain how completely disorienting this is. Everything that was sinking
now seems like it's floating. Your bubbles are going
the wrong direction. Your feet are coming
up over the top of you. For example, watch this simulator reset and watch what the seat
buckles do in the water. Your reference frame is rotating, okay. So if you watch this
you can understand it. But imagine trying to understand that while your blind, doing a
coordinate transformation in your head while at the same
time you're getting a swirly and your sinuses are filled with water. So if you can do that,
you're gonna be great. (laughing) - You unbuckle, your body will
right itself to the surface. Your lungs are full of air. And when you do that in
an upside down aircraft, oh no now everything's upside down. It's hard to imagine on how
to get out of that thing. It's better to stay inverted with it. When you go under water,
your vision drops to 2200, or worse, muddy waters, it's dark, it's late at night,
you can't see anything. So sitting in a seat
you know where you are. If you're sitting in a seat
you know exactly where you are. And then we tell them,
""Hey don't just pop loose and pull yourself along, stay in the seat, slide in the seat."" Because the aircrafts
are all set up with seats with their backs to the wall
where the exits are, right? So if you're in a seat you
kind of know where you're at. You know of know which
way, ""Oh it's to my right."" Even though it's muddy,
I can go to my right about five seats down and I should be able to feel on the wall and
find my exit, right? If you leave the seat,
you'll go right side up. And then it's like, ""Oh no."" Now their chairs are
hanging from the ceiling. It's disorienting. - [Destin] Once you lose
that frame of reference it's hard to get it back. - It's not impossible to find your way out if that happens, but it's harder. - [Destin] On the second
dunk people tend to be a little bit more serious about not dying. If the first dunk is about panic, the second dunk is about staying calm and learning to take your time and think. - [Instructor] Okay guys,
now that you've got air it gives you a little bit of
time to get out, stay calm. I want to see at least two breaths of air before you start trying to get out. Ditching, ditching, ditching! - [Destin] The next few runs they give you a bottle, which seems like it would solve all your problems, but it doesn't. I know it's hard to remember, but your face is filled with
water up to your sinuses. This marine that you're seeing, he's having a hard time
getting that first breath because his sinuses are
full so he does the symbol asking the instructors
to help pull him out. He puts his hands on his
head and the instructors stop what they're doing and
pull him out of the simulator. If you have that problem
again pinch your nose while you're still in your seatbelt, take a deep breath, and
once you let go of your nose that epiglottis will be shut, and then use your hands to
get out of that helicopter. By the third run people
are starting to understand what's going on, the trick is
to keep your reference points, think with your brain
and make it out alive. You can see here it's way more efficient looking than the earlier runs. When you have a situation
that goes bad pretty quick, and stuff literally hits the fan, like the rotors start hitting the water, and life turns upside down, and you feel like you're sinking, you're in over your head,
and it's a situation you don't know how to deal with. Some of these guys
didn't know how to swim. If you freak out in that moment, you're gonna stay in that dark place. That's literally suicide,
you cannot do that. What you have to do is
stay anchored to the truth, stay anchored to the things that you know. Keep your reference frame. For me in my life,
personally, I have things that I stay anchored to that
keep me aligned to truth. So, in that situation you do that, and then you start thinking
towards the safe exit from the situation. If you don't react
correctly, and you don't slow down and think, things
can go very bad in a hurry. It's very, very important not
to freak out in the chaos. Take one decision after another, slowly thinking it through, that gets you closer
and closer to the light. And eventually, once
you do that, in a series you will make it out and you
will see the light again. I hope you enjoyed this video. It was exciting training. I felt like I learned a lot both for my work in helicopters
and for life in general. I'm Destin, you're
getting Smarter Every Day. Have a good one, bye. (laughing) (water loudly splashing) - Help! (laughing) - [Destin] Good job dude. - Thanks! - [Destin] Yeah! - All right note to
self, swimming lessons. (laughing) To do! (laughing) - [Destin] You did good, man. - Thank you. - That was way better. - You gotta make it out of
the helicopter for this one. - Hey, in the real thing...",11:19
VjzgbZL12VI,videogamedunkey,VideoGames,I'm Done With League of Legends,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjzgbZL12VI,6 years ago,13M views,VideoGames,"I'm done making League of Legends videos. I'm sorry to my fans that only watch my League videos. But please, go watch my other videos. I put so much work into them, And they are honestly way better. I came to this decision when I was playing on ranked for my new video, where I was going to get diamond. *DING* Somehow we actually won this match. And then, I was two points shy of a series, when I encountered this player: This Malphite would just run down everybody's lane and feed kills until he was zero and nine. Uh, we also had a Bard mid-- We also had that going. And it was at this time that I called this Malphite: A fucking worthless braindead scumfuck bastard pile of trash mental dickface that should be gunned down in the street like the degenerate he is. *Sound effect* Now there is so much wrong with this. First, why am I being banned for talking shit in a video game? I can understand being banned for cheating, or going AFK a bunch of times, or picking Orianna AD Carry, or feeding on purpose. But talking shit to some guy that is a total dumbass? What is this, fucking pussy-ass baby preschool time? Talking shit is probably one of the only fun parts of this boring ass game. I might as well just play the bots if you want people to act like robots, Riot. *Silent Hill - Tears of .. begins playing* 
I wonder if they understand that the root of toxicity is the game. It's just not fun, and it pisses people off. Let me be serious here: League of Legends doesn't work as a competitve game or a fun party game to play with your friends. As of today, I have more than eight thousand matches played on this game. So I have some legitimate grounds to review the game. Laning Phase: The other guy sits under his turret and farms creeps for twenty minutes. Then the rest of the game is both teams walking around the map, accomplishing nothing, Until some dumbass gets caught. That's every match in a nutshell. The death timers are too short. The bounty system punishes you for doing good The turrets are fucking annoying. The rank system doesn't work at all. Most of this is just the game constantly inhibiting how good you can actually do. In any great competitve video game, there are so many techniques and opportunites for a great player to just whoop some ass. In League, you don't really have those options. And because this game wants to cater to the biggest audience possible to make the most money. Like Call of Duty, it's just gonna stay that way. Forever. And that's what I feel like I'm doing with my League videos. Even though my appreciation for this game is waning all the time and I wanna hit you guys with all these different kinds of videos. I've stuck with it Because I know my fans wanna see me play League Now, I know some of you are out there like: ""But Dunkey, what about the Pro Players?"" Now, please understand this, Pro League of Legends Has absolutely nothing to do with real League of Legends The Pros are in matches were all 10 guys are amazing at the game In real League of Legends: There's gonna be 3 decent guys, and 7 retards At its best, League is just something to play in the background while you talk to your friends but a lot of the time it's either: Too frustrating or monotonous If my friends actually get into it and try to win, they'll just get mad at each other and start yelling and get into a argument Um, but most of the time, people just keep Alt-Tabbing outta the game and pay very little attention to the actual game, y'know It just isn't engaging and then the match stretches into the 40-50 minute mark and nobody cares at all at that point the matches just go on for way too long, everytime. *Sad Music in the Background*
So I'm not enjoying the game, nobody I'm playing with is enjoying it but I still really want to finish this video up for you guys, cause you know once I get all the footage assembled and I've accomplished what I've set out to do for the video, that's when I have my fun, making it come to life you know, doing the editing, putting in the voiceover that's the payoff for me, that's the enjoyable part And I've been consistently putting out League videos. Since I started out on YouTube So i emailed Riot. I said ""Hey can you guys unban me so i can finish this video up"" Now keep in mind during my whole career of being the top guy promoting their game for four years. Riot has done almost nothing to help me out or promote me. And I emailed them for this first and only favor. And they respond to me ""nope you're toxic"" And this is when I realised That this company doesn't appreciate me at all Or anything I stand for *Ending - Mother 2 begins in the background*
I think multiplayer games should reward the time and practice You put into them And you should be able to call the people scumfuck bastards And connect with your friends and have fun playing with them. And League of Legends offers none of these things So I'm done with it. I'm done playing League of Legends I'll continue to play videogames and make videos because it's my passion. I love to make you guys laugh. I wanna keep making better videos . And I wanna represent games that I truly enjoy And League has lost my respect And it's lost that magic that used to make so fun for me And it's lost its soul *Ending Theme - Super Mario World begins playing* Oh this looks really interesting Mhm, mhm. Yeah yea yeah yeah I have now mastered Riven. I'm trying to remember the song I made for Akali And No! Not a sexy song. Thinks he's winning. Thinks he's real good. And then i go BADABOOM! BADA... *explosion sound* And this guy doesn't like to bring any quints No masteries, no moves. I am not here to learn you how to play Xin Zhao. We are you Chinese father
*laughter* Oh he put something- I am going to see you grandpa. *laughter* *inaudible slowed speech* I need Papa John's. I need one... ""This is not Papa Johns."" I need four pizzas I need QUAD pizzas. [Pizza Butt]: This is not Papa John's!
[Dunkey]: Papa John I need you!!! There is a girl in League of Legends and she makes more money than all of us! Wow! She is a graphic designer that works for School of Rock! Woahhh! What's wrong with his leg? I think it's back leg broke off *laughter* Hey Shrek go over there. Shrek: Wah! Woo-shu, woo-shu! WALL-E: WALL-E! It's level 3 here. Ugh, they found us! It was a sting operation. It was a trap! We've been set up! Gay mouse in position. IT'LL BE YEARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR- *Inhales* -EARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR [Thanks Dunkey for all the laughs over the years]",7:24
cJONS7sqi0o,PBS Space Time,Science,Why Haven't We Found Alien Life?,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJONS7sqi0o,6 years ago,3M views,Science,"Are we alone? Recent amazing
discoveries have given us more hope than ever that our
universe is full of life. So why don't we see it? [MUSIC PLAYING] Why don't we see
alien civilizations? We've asked this question
before here on ""Space Time,"" and if you haven't
seen that episode you should check it out. But today we'd like to go deeper
because it really does seem like there should be aliens. The Kepler Space
Observatory has told us there are a couple
of hundred billion nice, watery planets in the Milky Way
and probably billions of them are Earth-sized planets
around sun-like stars. Many of them have
been around long enough to produce
a civilization that could have easily colonized
the entire galaxy by now. So why is the Milky
Way so un ""Star Warsy?"" This genuine oddity is referred
to as the Fermi paradox and the resolution
for it has to be that there's some
sort of great filter that either makes
intelligent life extremely rare in the first place or
that wipes out, essentially, all advanced
civilizations before they get to the galactic
empire stage, whether by a nuclear war,
environmental catastrophe, accidentally making
a black hole that swallows the planet, et cetera. Personally, I'm not buying it. I just don't think that there's
an inevitable great filter still ahead of us. As we saw in a
previous episode, we're not so far from building
starships ourselves. Surely, some
civilizations must make it through these growing pains
and manage to reach the stars. So where are they? Well, there's another deeply
sad and deeply inspiring possibility. Humanity may be one of the
very first interstellar species in the history of the galaxy. But before we get all emo,
let's science this right. We know of exactly one
instance of intelligent life happening, the case of Earth. And as if it wasn't hard
enough to do statistics with a sample size
of one, we also have to deal with a
massive selection bias. Of course we're going to
observe at least one instance of intelligent life happening
because we are that one instance. In a way, it doesn't matter
how improbable sentience is. As long as it
happens once, it will be there to observe itself. Here we're touching on the
anthropic principle, which states that an
observer will always observe a universe that can make
observers or a planet that can. We'll talk about the
cosmic implications of this more in another
episode, but for now we need to acknowledge
that this selection bias allows that life could be
extremely rare, or even unique. Given that, can we even begin
to assess the likelihood of life out there? Yeah, we can science anything. So let's dig into whether
we should really expect to see a Salarian Empire. Let's take the knowns. Now, Earth certainly
required a number of very special
conditions to build life and it's hard to know how
essential each of these was or how frequently
these conditions are met through the galaxy. I'm going to avoid
details of the biology here because we
can say a lot just based on how much
time it took to get through each step on the path
to building technological life. We can crudely summarize
the big leaps that lead up to intelligent life
as one, assembly of self replicating RNA
from organic molecules; two, RNA based
proto-cells; three, DNA and the first actual cell-- this
is the moment of a biogenesis, life from not life; four,
increasingly complex single cells; five, the first
multicellular organisms so plants, animals, et cetera; and
six, the first intelligent life form capable of counting
to six on You Tube. Now, the crazy thing,
the thing that I find the least intuitive,
is that the first three steps in that chain
combined-- the appearance of true cellular
life-- happened faster than any of those later steps. so fast, in fact, that
it seems hard to believe. And in fact, so fast
that our galaxy probably should be brimming with
at least simple life. Let me explain. See, around four
billion years ago, pretty much just after the
Earth had first cooled down from being a giant
hellish magma bowl, we think that it
totally got pounded by a meteor storm that
lasted a couple of hundred million years. This is the late
heavy bombardment, and it probably
obliterated the surface. We think we know this
because we flew to the moon and found evidence of it. Up until recently, the
earliest known evidence of life dated to roughly
3.5 billion years ago, fossilized blue green algae
beds-- stromatolites-- found in Western Australia. The place was covered in
this greenish-purple slime that reeked of rotten eggs. Yeah, the beach was
horrible back then. Basically, Earth was once
a giant slimeball planet. And it looks like Earth
went from magma ball to slimeball in less
than 300 million years. What? That seems crazy fast. But it also suggests
that this first step, the genesis of life, is
not the great filter. But wait, the abiogenesis
thing gets even weirder. See, nature has provided
us with a perfect time capsule for studying
the very early Earth, zircons-- super hard silicate
crystals whose formation can be dated precisely by
the ratio of decaying uranium versus lead decay
product locked inside. And get this, just
recently a zircon was found containing the
possible signature of life and dated at 4.1
billion years ago, from before the late
heavy bombardment. That little crystal
contains what looks like biogenic carbon. That's a fancy way of saying
there's too little carbon 13 compared to carbon 12. See, photosynthetic
finds C12 a bit yummier, and so it absorbs more of
that than the heavier C13. Pretty much all carbon
enters the biosphere from the photosynthesizing
bottom of the food chain. Any carbon that's been
through living systems will have the same C13
light isotopic ratio that we see in this zircon. Now, there are other
nonbiogenic explanations, but this is extremely suggestive
that life was abundant on Earth remarkably soon after it
first coalesced from stardust and that life either survived
the late heavy bombardment or formed again after that
or the late heavy bombardment never happened. That's actually a
possibility, too. But either way, it
looks like Earth became a slimeball teeming with
life in a crazy short amount of time. How on earth did this happen? Two options. One, given the right
conditions the genesis of life happens like that, and two, it
didn't happen on Earth-- life was seeded from space, an
idea called panspermia. Look, there's no question
that lots of rock gets ejected into space
after meteor impacts and can move between planets. We've found plenty of
meteorites originally from Mars. A lot of the ejecta
from Earth is going to be swarming in bugs. Could similar
bacterial astronauts have once survived an
interstellar journey to Earth? Some bacteria are
certainly hardy enough to survive launch and landing. This has been tested. If these bacteria
were frozen solid, they could plausibly survive
a very, very long journey and you only need one out
of billions to make it. Maybe the solar wind
pushes infested material into interstellar
space so that tens of thousands, even millions,
of years later a single bug winds up on a brand new planet
and boom, instant slimeball. Questionable, but it
would mean that life only needs to evolve once from
scratch in any given galaxy. Now, this should
be very testable. Earth was infested
fast, so that means this stuff should be out there. Mars must have been
hit when it had water. Did it go slimeball? There should be something
like stromatolite fossils on its ancient surface. We haven't seen them yet,
but they'd be hard to spot. These cosmic cooties should
be findable in space, too. So either fast abiogenesis
or panspermia, one of them must be true. However, both suggest
that the galaxy should be teeming with slimeball
planets filled with life. Now, that's exciting. We don't have a telescope
to find them yet, but we could soon. These planets will
have atmospheres driven by biotic processes. If we could analyze
light passing through these
atmospheres, we would see signatures of
oxygen, ozone, methane, nitrous oxide at concentrations
impossible without a biosphere. Properly fund NASA and
its terrestrial planet finder and we could find
extraterrestrial life within 20 years. So it's entirely
possible that we'll soon discover that the galaxy
is filled with life. But this just makes it
weirder that the Milky Way isn't swarming with
ancient alien civilizations. There is a filter, but it's
not the genesis of life. The clue might be that the
Earth stayed a slimeball for nearly three billion years. The first multicellular organism
turned up only 600 to 800 million years ago
and life as we know it quickly exploded after that. Was this a random lucky event
that we just had to wait for? No, multicellular life evolved
independently dozens of times. It just took a really long
time for those single cells to become complex enough
to form large collaborative structures capable of
collective reproduction, i.e. plants, animals, a species
capable of making the Kerbal Space Program. And speaking of space
programs, technological life took a little while
longer, but not really so long on the overall
scale once we had complex life. After the Cambrian Explosion, it
was only around half a billion years to go from
jellyfish to moon landing. Of course, maybe the
emergence of intelligence is a random and unlikely
event, and this one is the hardest to assess. However, it's worth
noting that we do have other
species on Earth that seem to be moving down the same
big brain path independently of humans. So what is the great filter? Maybe it's just time. If life is common, then of the
billions of Earth-like planets in the galaxy, only
a tiny fraction needed to have a small
head start on us in order to have produced the
Federation of Planets and Stargates and stuff by now. So what if humanity
started early? Of all of the sun-like
stars and Earth-like planets that will ever form over
the full past and future history of star formation in
our universe, Earth is early. It's part of the
first 8%, according to recent Hubble Space
Telescope based calculations. We have emerged in the
epoch of life in a universe abundant in the rich resources
of past supernova explosions, but after the violence of the
starburst and quasar epochs. It strains
believability to imagine that life didn't or
won't happen elsewhere, but it is possible that we
are a very early outlier and that any other civilizations
are so distant as to not yet be apparent. Is humanity a first
generation intelligence, one of the species that
will watch and maybe guide as other intelligent life
emerges throughout the galaxy? Well, there's something to work
towards on the next episode of ""Space Time."" Last week we talked about
Miguel Alcubierre's warp drive. You guys had a lot to say. Let's do it. A lot if you noticed
my mistake in saying that Miguel Alcubierre is
Spanish, rather than Mexican. That was my mistake. We cram a lot of details into
each episode of ""Space Time"" and sometimes things like
this do slip through, so thank you for catching it. Miguel Alcubierre was, in fact,
born in Mexico and, in fact, educated up to
master's level there. Eric Vilas wonders
what it would look like seeing an
Alcubierre warp bubble race by from the outside. This is tricky. The bubble would
definitely leave some sort of light signature because
light inside the bubble can traverse the walls in any
direction besides forwards and our negative mass matter
may also end up on the outside. Because the bubble
is superluminal, any light that we see
would trail the bubble just like the sound of
a supersonic jet. Ahead of the bubble,
you'd see nothing unless it stopped, in which case
all the photons and particles that are captured on its journey
would blast you into oblivion. Now, a few of you took
issue with my statement that it's never aliens. And fair enough, it's never
aliens until it's aliens. The point of this philosophy
is that the alien hypothesis is a bad place to start
because you can explains almost any weird natural phenomenon
as having been produced by a super intelligent,
extremely high tech civilization with
inscrutable motives. Really anything. It's a week hypothesis
until you've generally ruled out everything else or
you actually see the mother ship and take an unsuspiciously
blurry photo of it. So Nate asks if we can please
do another challenge episode. Absolutely, we'll do one soon. [MUSIC PLAYING]",12:11
1R97tphpD_M,Barely Sociable,Informative,The Most Corrupt Investigation In Aviation History - The Mysterious Fate Of Pan Am Flight 7,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R97tphpD_M,5 months ago,1.5M views,Informative,[Music] today's video is brought to you by babel now if there's something that plagues me and many other creators on youtube is that every so often we will just completely mispronounce a word or name without any hesitation at all from george point toward gloucester island gloucester now apparently there's a name for this particular phenomenon and it's called calliope calliope it's called calliope syndrome it's essentially when you know a word and how it's spelled and what it means but you have no idea on how to pronounce it and i think this just goes to show you that whenever it comes to speaking any language it's an active process that you're constantly learning through not only reading but speaking as well and given this fact you might think that learning a second language would be an overwhelming task but the reality of that is is that it doesn't actually have to be difficult or overwhelming with babel it's been proven through various efficacy studies that as little as 15 hours on their app has been equivalent to a full college semester given the fact that statistics show that the average person spends about 15 hours on their phone a week just on social media that's not that much time and if you're wondering why babel is so effective the difference is is that they actually get you speaking from the very beginning and they actually cater their lessons to real life situations not just mindless testing as someone que tome tres anos de clases di espanol in escuela pero aprendi mas cuando practi que espanol in mi trabajo i can stand by the fact that many of the traditional ways of learning language are inefficient and expensive so instead of taking on any kind of student loan or debt to learn a second language how about i instead give you a

november 8 1957 where at around 11 30 a.m a boeing 377 stratocruiser by the name of a romance of the skies was getting ready to depart from san francisco california where the destination was honolulu hawaii the crew awaiting aboard the flight consisted of eight crew members of pan-american airlines 36 total passengers and at the time they thought their flight was going to be a luxury experience this boeing 377 stratocruiser that they were taking for this trip was quite literally the pinnacle of luxury for a plane back in the 50s it featured a large double-decker layout roomy seats a full buffet and a cocktail lounge on the bottom floor that could be accessed by a spiral staircase and pan-am of being one of the front-runners when it came to commercial aviation at the time was one of the first to actually accommodate such a plane and as a result they became one of the go-to's for luxury trips to honolulu from the west coast and it's safe to say that many of these passengers on this flight were looking for a resort style getaway but little did they know that whatever happened hours after their takeoff would remain a mystery for years to come [Music] as pan am flight 7 departed at 11 30 a.m nothing was out of the ordinary the passengers settled in there was no reported problems and the route was a straight shot from california into the pacific ocean it was a simple trip aside from the other 10 hour flight duration something you should understand with these flights is that given the long distance over the ocean flights were required to check in with an ocean vessel to make sure that they were on track a fix between california and hawaii was a weather vessel called ocean station november pan am flight 7 would go on to give all required positions to november with the captain checking in at promptly each time at 0 0 30 hours a second to last check-in would occur after receiving this message november would then tell pan am flight 7 that based on their radar they were 10 miles east of their location and 34 minutes later at 0 104 gmt pan am flight 7 would provide its final update from here after the plane was due to check in about an hour later but for some reason they were never heard from again [Music] with the plane's final transmission there was no mention of anything out of the ordinary and it wasn't like there was any major storm in the area either the weather was calm and despite this fact the plane never made another follow-up at 242 gmt pan am had notified the coast guard that had not heard from the plane in over 90 minutes it would take a little over an hour after that for the coast guard to begin dispatching search planes as the hours would pass without another message from the plane they had hoped that the flight had simply been having issues with this radio and would ultimately turn up in honolulu however as the search would go into the early hours of the morning they could safely assume that the flight had run out of fuel it was at this point that flight 7 had been declared downed in the pacific where in the following days this would become the largest search effort for a commercial plane at the time [Music] when flight 7 went missing it was almost as if everything was perfectly fine one moment and then completely catastrophic the next while coverage from the press made its way to the front of the newspapers pan am representatives rushed to give statements and do damage control while there was still hope for survivors at this point the search efforts continued after the initial night the next day the fleet included 30 aircrafts and 14 ships with the planned search area to cover some 150 000 square miles of the pacific where they focused along the path from where the plane's last position was reported hours after the initial search began the navy then ordered an aircraft carrier by the name of the uss philippine sea from long beach california to join additionally two gearing class destroyers from san diego joined the search fleet as well as the search efforts continued over the coming days pilots began to receive sos signals from the northeastern corner of the search area the signals were coming from the same frequency and format that would be found on a gibson girl transmitter and that would have been the same kind of radio found on the life raft of flight 7. lieutenant donald lang one of the pilots who ended up hearing the signal stated to the paper at the time the sos was followed by a series of numbers i could not make out all of them clearly but i do know definitely the last number was 4 and i think the second to last number was also 4. pan am of flight 7's tail number was 90944 but despite this claim the sos calls were later labeled a false alarm from an unknown party and no other reported emergencies were accounted for to explain this furthermore on that same day pilots had reported seeing a red flare and yellow dye marker around the area of where the plane had gone missing but that's not the only thing that was found on the 10th the navy's radar had also picked up unidentified floating objects around 80 miles southwest of the last known location after rushing to the location the ship was reported to have found objects but was apparently not able to identify them the next day on the 11th 10 more faint sos signals made their way to opolo point on the big island of hawaii the transmission started at 1 32 pm on this particular day but after 10 or so broadcasts they stopped while there wasn't much follow-up on this particular signal the statement given by the coast guard soon after stated that this could have been someone testing emergency equipment and that they could have been sent from another part of the world on november 14th a pilot from pan am flying the same route between san francisco and honolulu had reported seeing an apparent 2 by 4 cylindrical object with a dye marker nearby seen floating among the waves the location was some 117 miles south of the plane's last reported position and after dropping a flare and marker the coast guard showed up to the location later that day from here the newspaper reported that the object was classified as quote unidentified debris and while the search efforts had continued to get their hopes up before a single solid lead the search would take a rather bizarre twist on that same day where over 90 miles north of the plane's last reported position various bodies and other debris from the plane was found at drifting in the ocean over the course of two days a total of 19 victims were pulled from the ocean where 14 of them were wearing life jackets all of them didn't have shoes and three of the watches found on the victims all stopped ticking at 5 27 pm which converted to gmt it places the impact at around 23 minutes after their last reported position but despite finding all of these bodies and various bits of debris no major parts of the plane were found and of what remained of the plane the debris consisted of charred bits of wreckage male cushions and other buoyant parts of the plane and regarding the recovery efforts for the rest of the plane given the depth of this part of the ocean it was about sixteen and a half thousand feet deep and was deemed it too deep to search or recover thus the rest of the plane was left to the ocean and despite many hints of other survivors such as flares dye markers and sos signals the navy commander ordered a halt on the rescue efforts claiming the passengers had met a swift and violent end however further examination of the bodies would show a different story additionally the navy commander offered no explanation as to why various parts of the plane were found to have been burned with the navy's search coming to a close the civil aeronautics board was attacked further with investigating the reasoning behind this crash and it's safe to say that when their report would finally be released over a year later their findings would really only deepen the mystery [Music] [Music] it's hard to even know where to start when picking apart the many details given by the civil aeronautics board and their investigation and despite many pieces of evidence pointing one way the report makes assumptions about the entire set of evidence which they don't have access to and while the report fairly notes that they can't be certain what caused the plane to come down and due to the available evidence it still brings forth a number of new interesting details and theories and one of these interesting details that was found among the people recovered in the water was that after a series of tests for toxic materials in their system 14 of the 19 recovered bodies were noted to have had excessively high levels of carbon monoxide the cab in the report questions the validity of these test results as some sort of anomaly related to decomposition and while possible if true this could have also meant that there was a potential fire aboard the flight however none of the passengers that they found in the water had any kind of burn injuries and of the items that remained as debris none of the items had been burned below the water line the cab speculated that it was only possible that a fire could have broken out after the plane had landed a rather hasty assumption given the fact that 98 of the wreck was still sitting at the bottom of the ocean and furthermore the same treatment is given to any discussion of sabotage no traces of prohibited explosives or material were found but just because something wasn't found doesn't necessarily mean that it was ruled out completely furthermore the cab explained that none of the items listed on the cargo manifests would have contributed to any fire after the crash while a package of sodium sulfide was a part of the plane's cargo the investigators found no trace of the substance and determined no correlation continuing on the pilot and the purser's body were also recovered and both of the bodies had bruises and abrasions on their thighs this clue seemed to indicate that these two people were seated during impact additionally one stewardess was found still strapped floating in her chair making a total of three seated during impact however on the other hand no such bruising was present on any of the other passengers likely indicating that they were possibly walking around the cabin at the time of impact but that being said the cab also noted that the various passengers were in relatively good condition despite you know being dead but all things considered the bodies lacked severe lacerations and a wall scuffed up bruised and several of the victims contained fractures this wasn't the cause of death for the majority of them only about five of the victims had been determined to have perished via physical injuries while they presumed the rest succumbed to drowning ultimately they concluded the following regarding the impact although severe it was not sufficiently great to cause a complete disintegration of the aircraft and furthermore in the report they state a fairly flat angle of impact is indicated by the nature of the damage to the recovered material its location within the aircraft and by the lack of severe mutilation of the bodies the part of the aircraft from which the recovered wreckage came indicated breakage of the fuselage at about the same locations as has occurred on a previous survivable ditchings of the same model aircraft these circumstances suggest a nearly survivable ditching may have been accomplished given this conclusion this paints the naval commander's statement that all of them died immediately in a far different light given the fact that various sos signals were heard the fact that the majority of the crew members were left and the various flares and dye markers found drifting in the ocean may have indicated a slight chance that those people made it off in a life raft but continuing on regarding what actual pieces of wreckage were found the items found floating were mostly bits of debris from the rear pressurized cabin with slightly more items being recovered on the right side but furthermore one of the more interesting details was that the plane seems to have turned northwest the cab report even seems stumped by this and offers no explanation for why the plane would have turned away from their intended route had the ditching attempt to been successful the pilot was aware that november could aid in their situation so the fact that they chose to ditch in this direction seems to be out of ignorance or by force as this would have only made rescuing them harder as it wouldn't have been along their intended route now when the report moves on to mention the plane's maintenance the cab notes several regularities such as a couple incidents where they had hard landings and forgot to do an inspection or two but ultimately they end up claiming that it had nothing to do with this accident but once again it's hard to link any kind of irregularity if you don't even know what caused the plane to go down in the first place continuing on however the board would place the most likely blame for this particular incident on the plane's propeller and while it was true that the stratocruisers were known to have instances of the propeller causing engine failure or even detachment mid-flight based on the track record of these accidents the majority of the time they weren't deadly we'll touch more on this later on in the video and while a chain reaction could have been possible that would have cut the radios out that's under the assumption that there was no distress call at all because perhaps one of the most disturbing paragraphs in this report was the following the board considered it entirely possible that an emergency message might have been sent from the flight after the 104 position report and that such message might not have been heard pursuing this possibility the ar inc recording tapes for the frequency in which such message would be recorded were carefully examined initially nothing was apparent however repeated playbacks of the tapes of the period following the zero 104 position report disclosed previously unknown transmissions which were extremely weak and subject to varied and conflicting interpretation now the fact that this report mentions a possible tape that could have been recording a potential distress call but due to deferring opinions on what was on the tape it was never included as potential evidence and here after this tape vanished from the public record and no formal copy of it has ever been found in pan american archives this seems very questionable but we'll get back to this in a bit because to summarize this report it doesn't seem to draw many conclusions and the only points they seem to settle firmly on seemed to be for the sake of saving face for pan am while technically nothing could really be ruled out they claimed sabotage was impossible they claimed the fire had to have started after the crash and regarding those maintenance records let's just say those weren't properly investigated either this is rather suspicious but to add to the layers of our mystery here something you should understand in the context of the cab was that before this government agency was disbanded essentially the same government agency tasked with managing the competition between the airlines was the same one that got to make the safety rules as well as the same group responsible for investigating accidents this was a recipe for conflict of interest and even the advisor to fdr mentioned that consolidating these agencies might result in some cases where investigators would whitewash the reasoning behind a major accident now as far as what details were known regarding conflict of interest at this particular time one mechanic at one of the 944 hearings had reportedly testified that he had overheard a cab investigator and a pan am executive discussing where they were going to go to dinner that night and what time they were going to play golf the next morning pan am benefited greatly from the situation remaining a mystery lest further scrutiny and lawsuits come their way regarding the safety of their aircraft or the negligence of anyone from their company if this was sabotage or an accidental fire the question is then raised why weren't there further safety precautions to prevent this if the accident was conclusively due to poor maintenance the question is then why was pan am not properly taking care of their aircraft in either situation a pan-am would be left at the whim of an unsympathetic jury but lucky for them you would need to provide evidence of proper negligence and that's pretty hard to do when the majority of the evidence has been left at the bottom of the ocean and while pan am and the cab weren't too interested in getting to the bottom of things that wouldn't stop other details regarding this case to come out soon after [Music] now while certain details made it into the cabs report an extra set of details did not and that includes the fact that for some time pan am had suspected one of their own employees to have played a role in sabotaging the flight part of the research of greg hurkin and ken fortenberry who both have personal ties to this particular mystery as ken fortenberry's father was the navigator and greg herkins 4th grade teacher was one of the flight attendants so that being considered after looking through various pan am records and interviewing various employees they discovered quite a few interesting details regarding one of the pursers aboard flight 7. that purser was eugene crossway and by company records he was reported to have been mentally unstable written up multiple times for a strange behavior apparently labeled as having a suicidal persecution complex and as a resident of santa cruz he was reported to have had issues with the police in his hometown where they labeled him a psycho over the treatment of his stepdaughter now he became a father due to his wife's previous marriage and after his wife passed away three months before this flight he had become resentful towards his daughter where he reportedly blamed the death of his wife on his daughter cross weight by other accounts represented the company he worked for he reportedly held a grudge against pan am as a result of him getting tuberculosis in shanghai while working on one of their flights and the morning that pan am flight 7 was getting ready to take off he had updated his will to disinherit his daughter unless very specific criteria were met and left it in the glove box of his car before getting onto the plane after interviewing various relatives crossway's father-in-law had recalled him showing a handful of blasting powder several days before the flight and on the week before his flight he'd reportedly spent the previous week spending long hours in the basement of his relative's house with this new lead they searched far and wide around his property but never ended up finding the source of this powder after the crash and even crossway's daughter had testified to the police that she believed that crossway had taken down the plane as he was quote too chickened to go alone now obviously none of these details made it into the report however that being said crossway's case isn't the only red flag among passengers of flight 7 because when it came to the earlier days of commercial aviation there were multiple instances of people purchasing large insurance policies and then sabotaging the plane to collect the money a man by the name of john gilbert graham placed an explosive into his mother's suitcase after he had purchased a life insurance policy from the airport another person by the name of albert guy did a similar thing in 1949 to his wife now the reason both of these men ended up getting caught was because the wreckage was able to be fully recovered and recovered quickly as in the case of john gilbert graham there was a strong explosive smell coming from the baggage compartment of the plane but in the case of albert gwy guy had actually attempted to set the timer on the explosive to the exact time that the plane was over the saint lawrence river had the plane been sabotaged at the correct time collecting forensic evidence at the time would have been much harder but what guy didn't anticipate was the fact that the flight was delayed by five minutes so given this recent history it was worth considering that the total amount of insurance bought for all of the passengers in this flight and that was a total of 235 thousand dollars and one passenger had an abnormally high amount of insurance one of the tickets sold to a passenger on flight 7 belonged to a man by the name of william harrison payne and some of the details surrounding payne would come out to the newspapers over a year later as a separate insurance company had gone to the press offering their own investigation and they were refusing to pay out one of the policies that they had for william payne because when they had investigated pain they found his story to be somewhat suspicious according to his official story payne was going to hawaii to collect money owed to him from a long overdue debt the wife refused to disclose the amount of debt that was owed to william payne she also refused to provide the name of the debtor and he only bought a one-way ticket on top of that the investigator looked at the call history for payne and showed that he made no calls to hawaii he was not known to have had any acquaintances from hawaii and looking at the family's bank account it showed that they were on the brink of bankruptcy the family's bank account for the month of october went from 631. with an ending balance of 18.49 and on november 4th they wrote two checks one for an amount of 175.54 this bought a one-way ticket to honolulu and the second check totaling 437 dollars and 40 cents paid for fire insurance on their lodge for a year and william harrison payne didn't have one not two not three but four life insurance policies that would have covered his trip the first two were travel policies that were insured from separate companies at the airport for a total of 125 000 another was from a private insurance company by the name of western life insurance this policy was ten thousand dollars and would double to twenty thousand in case of an accidental death and his fourth policy that he carried came in the form of a national service life policy which was valued at ten thousand dollars and this wasn't gi insurance from the government all in all the total payout to his wife should he pass away would have been 155 000 for today's equivalent that would be around 1.5 million and details only get stranger as you look into payne's life situation for 22 years he had been a navy frogman a demolition expert he was honorably discharged from the navy however he then began working as an operator of an inn called the roxbury lodge in scottsbar california due to this lodge payne was in overwhelming amounts of debt and he was continuing to lose more and more money as a result of this occupation the previous lodge owner had sold it to payne as they weren't able to turn a profit on it anymore and after payne was discharged from the navy he had hoped to turn the operation around back into a profitable business from various mining operations and while these ultimately proved unsuccessful as the money was continuing to dry up forcing him into far more debt this led to other money-making schemes from payne as he had recently gotten in trouble with the law a year prior he had set up an illegal tollbooth on a public road near his lodge then after being threatened with arrest should he not stop he blew up and bulldozed 1.6 miles of the road it wouldn't be until three weeks before his flight to honolulu that payne had also been hit with an additional fine for 550 for his crimes a year prior and while you might expect the widow to be grieving seven months after flight 7 disappeared harriet payne william payne's wife took a trip to tijuana and got married to their neighbor two days after while the couple was on their honeymoon the roxbury lodge had burned to the ground if you recall payne paid for a year of insurance on that lodge the same day he bought that ticket the insurance company expected arson and wanted to investigate further it was at this point that harriet payne would go on to file a lawsuit forcing them to settle the particular case harriet payne would also go on to sue the western life insurance company as well for not paying out the 20 000. after the judge was presented with two testimonies that of the mother of william payne who claimed she saw him walk up the stairs that morning and a written statement from a pan am counter agent who claimed that he had checked in william payne that morning and a subsequent head count showed that all the passengers were on board that morning the judge then quickly scolded the insurance firm despite them not getting to present much of their case now given the parents testimony claiming that they both saw him go off that day this would mean that the following is also true payne took his newly born daughter on a car ride from roxbury lodge to stockton california the days before then on the day of the flight payne his parents and his daughter all made their way back to san francisco the morning of and if this is true that means that payne left his daughter in his mother's care to see an unknown someone to collect an unknown debt and would return at an unknown date all while having no money two bad checks ready to bounce and a house is about to be foreclosed on that being said though william payne's body was never found harriet payne would also receive an additional 71 000 after settling out of court with pan am and an additional five thousand dollars after the lodge had burned down in total harriet payne would collect about 231 thousand dollars from the death of her husband or when calculated for inflation about 2.2 million naturally you have to ask if harriet payne agreed that the purpose of her husband's trip to honolulu was to collect a debt but would not disclose the amount or who it was coming from you might stop for a moment to think what she really meant by that and if william payne had nothing to do with flight 7 going missing it might be worth asking if the flight was sabotaged in a different way i think we need to address one of the bigger picture issues about the romance of the skies and per the research of greg herkin and ken fortenberry again one of the things they uncovered in their search for more info was further evidence of collusion between the cab and pan am previous inspections on the aircraft in the weeks prior showed that one of 944's engines had experienced constant fluctuation in oil pressure leaks from the turbochargers and a persistent cooling problems and at the time pan am was getting a bit in over their head with these boeing 377s while luxurious and they may have been the pinnacle of air travel in the day the aircraft was continuing to cost the airline more and more money and this short-lived model of plane was well on its way to getting a replacement that would be more cost efficient rather than take a loss in the interim though this meant that pan am had to cut corners in less ethical areas such as cutting inspection staff and having mechanics sign off on their own work rather than a supervisor and when it came to the hearings at the cab regarding flight 7 a union representative for the fleets at san francisco claimed that there had been a drastic curtailment of inspection personnel so much so that he cited it to a dangerous level and perhaps the worst part about all of this was that pan am had used their influence to change the wording in the cabs report where the attorney for pan am had written to the cab that he hoped to withhold the maintenance report from the public and in the final report we see no mention of the aforementioned now given the fact that poor maintenance may have played a role in this mystery it's worth considering the consequences of a propeller related malfunction that may have led to an engine failure as this is one of the main theories regarding this mystery and like i mentioned earlier this is perhaps one of the most well documented problems with the boeing 377 and while it may have been possible that the engine detaching or a propeller losing control would definitely have caused some problems that's not to say that it would have been deadly the majority of the time and something i want you to take into consideration regarding aircraft investigations at the time was that there were no black boxes and something that we have learned in the modern day with aviation safety is that relying on a wreck solely for information on how the plane crashed is a terrible idea and in this particular case i believe it leads to a phenomenon that you may have heard of it's called a survivorship bias only the planes that made it back alive could tell you what went wrong and the skews your perception of reality as you make assumptions about what you do not know and this also happened with planes during world war ii and taking a look at this photo you might notice something while the us military thought at the time that the most shot areas needed more armor the reality of what this photo was showing you is that the planes that made it back didn't get shot in the most vital area and that being said in the limited discussions i found on this particular topic nearly everyone writes off the majority of the story and just focuses on the propeller problem so let's peel back some of that context and figure out just how deadly and unsafe the stratocruiser actually was on january 24th 1950 a stratocruiser enroute to japan lost its number four engine but still managed to land safely and a similar thing happened to another stratocruiser the next day they also managed to land safely in 1951 a strata cruiser in route to an airport in new york city landed safely but found it 12.5 inches of the propeller missing additionally another propeller incident took place in 1953 where a flight from honolulu to wake island had another propeller mishap but this time the pilot changed the route to a closer destination and after an additional 350 miles everyone landed safely another incident in 1956 occurred very close to where flight 7 went down this was actually pan am flight 6 and it was a sister aircraft to flight seven called sovereign of the skies the flight was returning to san francisco from honolulu and about halfway through the number one engine over sped right around the location of ocean station november and the pilot managed to stay in the air till daybreak and then ditched the plane and all 31 people survived they even got the entire situation on camera nearly every instance of this propeller overspeed incident occurring wasn't deadly and the only single verified instance we know of without a shadow of a doubt that was deadly was in 1955 where the number three engine and propeller tore loose off the wing of a 377 off the coast of oregon the pilot still managed to regain some control and ditch resulting in only four casualties while the other 19 survived these never resulted in a loss of radio communication and in each case there was a distress call and on top of that there was no fire damage after the fact so survivorship bias aside this propeller problem was largely not a death sentence and while this problem is cited in one of the worst accidents ever attributed to a 377 let's take a look at what actually happened [Music] [Music] so one particular case in 1952 made this problem infamous where a 377 in route from rio de janeiro to the port of spain had some circumstances that were eerily similar to flight 7. one minute everything seemed fine until the plane had failed to make its next position report there was no distress call then after going missing with a massive search effort for several days they found that the plane had completely disintegrated over what was at the time a dense and unexplored part of the amazon jungle where shortly after various newspapers covered the story where the u.s air force had given a comment stating photographs of a plane and the disposition of the bodies had indicated that the plane had exploded additionally another report 19 days after this came out in the newspaper stating the cab officials said their field investigators have determined the wreckage was too widely scattered for the plane to have crashed from engine failure pointing to the possibility that the tragedy resulted from a mid-air explosion shortly after this plane went down a rival expedition funded by the former governor of sao paulo ademar pereira de barros used paratroopers to drop to the scene a few days after the plane had been located and this rogue expedition funded by a politician had beat the main search party to the location where they soon found that they had ransacked the site and this was particularly interesting because there were other reports at the time from the brazilian government's own newspaper i had stated that 200 000 in currency 500 grams of aqua marines and other things like diamonds have been reported on the plane now as tensions built between the two search parties the expedition later turned to a matter of survival as the unofficial group had not packed enough supplies and they began to steal supplies from the official search party after the main search party became strained of resources the main search party decided to abandon their efforts and leave the other rival search party to the elements at this point only a handful of the unofficial group still remained and they decided to take two members of the official investigation hostage and while the situation was later de-escalated and everyone was rescued it wouldn't be until two and a half months later that they would actually conduct a proper investigation and looking through this final report they do a complete 180 and throw out all previous mentions of sabotage and the report neatly places blame on the propeller all while refusing to explain how the plane disintegrated and the only evidence they had to support this theory of this propeller being the issue was that the number two propeller in its engine were not found with the other pieces of wreckage and aside from some oil also found in the plane that's really the only evidence they had to come up with this theory moreover what's particularly interesting about this plane is that it was noted to have very little signs of collision damage when it crashed or the investigation deduces that the plane's disintegration was more so a result of something that happened in the air but thereafter they failed to come up with any logical explanation for why that happened and looking through their various reasoning for why it could not have been sabotage it's hardly convincing as the investigation tried to argue that the plane had disintegrated without exploding and while they know to no relative distortion of the fuselage once again this is a case of them speculating on evidence they don't have access to because given how little remained of the plane's center fuselage from a subsequent fire this isn't conclusively ruled out and in their words not mine any evidence of an explosion could have been obliterated by a subsequent fire and their second point of contention against any type of explosion was that if an explosion did take place it should have separated the plane's spar from the fuselage and the spar is essentially the main load-bearing portion of the wing now that being said the left wing was found detached a half mile away and the fact that every other instance of this propeller failing resulted in a distress call but in this particular instance they explained that away saying that radios in the area were known to not work or that some kind of language barrier would have prevented them from sending an sos but clearly the radio worked perfectly fine when they gave their positional report and while i could spend a lot more time picking apart this particular report ultimately if you're going to argue that the plane disintegrated without exploding all while doubling back on your original statement you'd expect some heavy evidence in the opposite direction but that's not what happens and especially when you consider the bizarre circumstances surrounding the original investigation or some of the evidence may have been tampered with there's a number of different scenarios that you can let run wild in your head and while they fail to establish any reason for structural disintegration ultimately they leave it as we don't know but it definitely was not sabotage and perhaps the most questionable piece of evidence with this entire thing a man by the name of jorge de godoy now godoy one of the passengers on pan am flight 202 was the attorney general to brazil and reportedly there had already been multiple attempts to assassinate him and a later search of his desk showed something incredibly interesting it was an unopened cablegram that was sent to him days before but he had not opened it when they read the message that was left on his desk it was a warning sent to him by us officials warning him not to travel by plane rather suspicious when you factor in that other reports of the time had labelled ade marperia as a political arch-nemesis to godoy [Music] [Laughter] [Music] now that we have a full context in this propeller problem there's one final piece of evidence that i wanted to show you in regards to pan am flight 7 because the fact that this was left out of the final report is incredibly concerning as it paints a far different picture regarding the crash and the people investigating it because one of the final documents that was found by the two previously mentioned men ken fortenberry and greg herkin was a detail so damning it showed that the cab had completely covered up crucial pieces of evidence for the sake of saving face for pan am this doesn't fully solve the mystery but if you recall that tape i mentioned in the accident report containing an sos message where they mentioned that due to differing opinions and what was on the tape they didn't include it in the evidence that mystery tape was partially found in 2014 but it wasn't the tape itself that's still missing it's the transcript of the tape and in regards to the original investigation into pan am flight 7 when they were going over the radio transmissions they managed to hear a faint distress call over the radio and while they concluded there was a message on it they couldn't decipher the specifics that much is true and it was originally written off however two audio engineers from the dictaphone corporation had later volunteered to review the tapes and provide findings using more advanced audio equipment and this transcript is what they deciphered from the tape and apparently this was independently verified by four different witnesses keep in mind the words in this paper are still a weak translation of what was on the tape it starts with so292 special number and flyer also understood as number on fire attention all stations pan american air verification channel bearing 11. still have one at tank full am ditching flight cq cq syracuse new york j arm tail is missing then a new voice would come onto the report did you chart me followed by some unaudible words and then special position then it would go back to the original voice stating fuel control three four five six followed by a zero two fuel flow zero two fuel flow coordinate what about 3 engine now there's a couple of things about this transcript that we need to consider but first off the context of the script is open for interpretation and while i'm going to give my thoughts on this transcript i would also like to hear what you guys have to say as well now the second thing about this transmission is that it was over an open microphone at around seven and a half minutes after the final position report placing this around a 111 to 112 a gmt and the final thing we need to consider is that the transmission may or may not cut out as only context that they could decipher from this particular transcript was that it happened after seven and a half minutes and to explain what i mean for this first part with esso i would presume that would be a cut off part of an sos and then after that 292 special would be presumed to be 292 special position as he states this later in the transcript and 292 would likely be the first digits of their northern coordinate then the transmission resumed with number on fire as i think this might make the most sense given the co2 found in the bodies later on then continuing down a couple lines bearing 11 seems to be in reference to the fact that they were heading north east a couple more lines down from that a cq cq is a type of radio call however i'm not entirely sure why they would direct that at syracuse new york then the next line j-arm is missing tail now if parts of their tail are actually missing that would drastically reduce the pilot's control over the plane and would likely cause a crash soon after looking at various flight simulators for when this happens you can see how drastic something like this would be however it's also worth considering that something caused the flight crew to make a drastic turn to the right and i must say this is just speculation but i'm not entirely convinced of this particular cause given the various sos signals found later on and on the other hand this particular phrase could be a part of a cut out transmission or it could have been misheard by the interpreters now in regards to the last lines in their mention of fuel control and zero two fuel flow something you should know about these types of planes is that they also had flight engineers and navigators also inside of the cockpit and from what i can tell regarding these mentions of oxygen fuel flow and fuel control this would be them adjusting their plane's settings for a ditch now this last mention of three engine this last phrase is also incredibly mysterious and this last statement could hint at a range of things it could be as big as them noticing a sudden problem with that engine or as little as them simply communicating to each other regarding their controls but on that note if they were having problems with number three engine whatever had happened to cause them to ditch had already happened prior to them making this distress call and we know the plane would impact with water at around 127 gmt around 13 and a half minutes after this initial conversation took place so as to why this would be the crew's last recorded transmission that is also a mystery and while ultimately this gives us a pretty clear timeline the nature of what this emergency was and how it happened is still anything but clear and in conclusion whatever the fate of flight 7 may be i must say it's one of those mysteries that will remain unsolved until there is some easy way to scan the bottom of the ocean to get our answer assuming the plane's wreckage remains after all of these years it may be as simple as just taking a look down there to give the situation some clarity but until then given the amount of questionable details regarding this investigation the possibilities regarding how the plane endured its final moments are vast from the questionable details surrounding the maintenance schedule over at pan am to the questionable details surrounding the story of the purser and william payne but whatever the case may be perhaps one of the most eye-opening things about air crash investigations at this time it seemed that nobody was fully interested in investigating this crash beyond the surface level and the people whose job was to investigate this barely lifted a finger beyond blaming a known issue without much evidence and it's particularly pathetic that when they found information that questioned their initial assessment they went as far as to cover it up and push it to the side and i want you to keep in mind that people who have kept this mystery alive over the years are people with personal connections to this mystery one of the main sources which i've referenced through and throughout this video is ken fortenberry and his book flight 7 is missing the search for my father's killer and given the fact that his search for answers have spanned his entire life i can only imagine how downright frustrating it must have been to have had at least portions of this mystery gatekept for so many years while ken writes in his book that he believed that eugene crossweight the purser was behind this incident after speaking to his stepdaughter decades later particularly about his mental state there's still a strong case to be made for someone like william payne or a number of other mechanical issues or even a freak accident well as always i'd love to know what you guys think about this entire situation i think all i have to say for now is that this is barely sociable have a good night [Music] foreign,48:04

oUoO3Ik8aIk,Linus Tech Tips,Tech,UNBOXING the GOD OF GAMING PCs!!,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUoO3Ik8aIk,Streamed 3 years ago,8.1M views,Tech,"so I've never actually seen a crate that's closed exactly like this this arrived for us Oh Matt almost two weeks ago I think but we've been so busy in the rush leading up to taking a week off for the holiday and with a bunch of like really time-sensitive projects that even though this has been sitting there taunting me I haven't had a chance to even look at it so what's inside this crate is to my knowledge the first sample that digital storm has sent out of their new flagship a vente mechs gaming PC and it does appear as though the live stream is working so I was just I was just checking that real quick to make sure that that was working and this is really bizarre because it's working on YouTube throwing floatplane but doesn't seem to be working on floatplane add Kenya send Luke a quick text message or give him a quick call see if we can sort that out I don't know how that works David you can close that door if you don't want to listen to me thank you David so anyway here come on have a have a look at this so I've seen a lot of crates in my day opened a lot of crates in my day but this one's really weird so we got the nail gun okay nail gun we've seen before we've got the staples staples we've seen before up here we've got more staples but these clips these clips are actually something that I'm not familiar with so it appears as though they just pop off like this this may be a very unspectacular uncrating here which is a shame because I had like all my tools ready and everything had my framing hammer my drill corded because you know we don't take chances when it comes to live productions you know that's why all of our live productions go so smoothly without any issue and I've got my what would Gordon do crowbar you know I was actually so pissed the first time I figured out that someone had used this as an actual crowbar because I don't know if you guys remember this but back when nvidia launched like i don't know the 580 or something i was like a thousand years ago 680 it's got an nvidia shield on it so it must be kepler but back when they launched it this was like a swag random swag item that they sent out and it used to be in great shape but you know i actually like it better this way like battle-worn you know let's go ahead in make sure you tell them that the YouTube stream and twitch streams are both working so like tell them don't just unplug the server because we are streaming alright let's open this baby so specs wise you can pretty much guess what's in here it is everything to the max I think this is something like $7,000 u.s. or nine thousand eight thousand I don't know it's somewhere in the neighborhood of like closer to ten thousands than it is to five thousand gaming system and by the time you are looking at a gaming system that costs that much it's hardly even really a gaming system anymore it's just an everything system like what can't it do oh well that's not what I was expecting I mean I don't know what I was expecting but they sent all this crate but then the box itself is actually like pretty reasonable it's just a normal digital storm box I guess the crate was more just out of concern for it arriving in one piece which I can relate to we actually just got back one of our oh my god this is heavy how the hell am I gonna get it out of here so we just got back one of our og rig reboot systems that we had sent to the winner and that thing is bad actually you know what Edie can you fire Ivan a message tell them to bring that 20 atti down here man we have some we have some tech Gor for you guys it just got absolutely savaged during shipping it's like tragic to look at actually to say that it was dropped would be an understatement really really disappointing I mean the winner is also disappointing because it means they don't have their system yet we got to file a claim bla bla bla bla bla bla really really sucks crappy situation all around but basically what happened was the the the graphic the RAM came loose and like banged around inside it and then the Soha leading us back to our secret shopper talking about how common it is for RAM to come loose and shipping there you go literally just happened to us except instead of just coming loose a little bit it came out there's like dents like it looks like someone shot the back of the video card with a BB gun and then the graphics card ripped out of the slot so the PCI Express connector is pretty mangled oh my god what the hell how is a system that's heavy what yeah no no I got this don't worry it's fine come on I just need it on the tipping point ah there we go wow it's so bottom heavy like look at this look how far I had it tipped over that is still gonna go backwards that's how heavy this system is I don't think I've ever seen anything like it okay let's see if we can get it out now come on okay maybe if we can kind of walk it a little get it free of that piece of foam on the bottom that's why the crates so big so you can you can get in there with your system because you'll be so excited to have it you'll just want to like you know snuggle it I don't know just making stuff up I'm just stalling for time at this point longtime viewers will be familiar with this strategy of mine just because that used to be half of the video back when the channel was mostly unboxings was me babbling while I figure out how to open packaging this is all complicated it's all different you know and so have you like I can't get to slide it really just have to keep okay [Applause] one second watch my turn oh my my toes are fine thank you I got it just come on Steve some leverage just gonna leave her it up just get in there nope it's so heavy okay so if you order one of these I recommend having your Butler help you open it because let's face it if you order one of these you probably have a butler oh holy crap like Brendan can you get a sense watching me move this thing around for how heavy it is I wish I had a scale or something quantify this now I brought this table over here to put it on but I think we might have a problem ah I might need a different table oh there it is okay yeah sorry I hear Ivan you want to throw this on here this is just this is just sad he brought the whole system down so a couple things check this out that is the battery holder for the motherboard how we came to be in possession of the battery holder for the motherboard well that's a tale that's not for the weak of heart so first of all we found the RAM here and I even got a little confused cuz he was like dude we just put like an extra heat spreader there as a decoration no sirs and Madam's we did not do such a thing it came out of the slot and ended up there so check this out do we know what caused that is that the RAM bouncing around graphics card that's a bummer okay hold on hold on don't don't skip to the finale yet check this out this PCI Express slot is coming down at an angle here and you can see the bottom part of it has actually been sheared off see that through these little pieces coming free here we have some like abrasion marks here on the chipset heatsink yeah I mean none of this really looks that bad this this is where things get really ugly so people people have often asked me why I'll talk about like why I whine I used to whine and harp on the packing materials in case boxes back in the day when I'd unbox them and it's because system integrators build systems in them then they use those boxes to ship the completed system and if your box isn't over built if it's designed only for the case this is what happens this is how you get dead graphics cards no digital storm they're going a little over the top here but that's not necessarily a bad thing but come in come have a look at this so the top of the PCI bracket here you can see has been bent but not nearly as bad as the bottom so this has been so far that the graphics card was able to rip free from the slot and it pulled the threading out of these thumb screws because that's how heavy these r-tx cards are and this this is where we're really running into trouble this is where this card goes from maybe we could still get it to work just replace the PCI bracket - this card is never going to retrace anything again you can see that the contact fingers along the PCI Express slot here two of them here on the power section have been shared clean off or not quite clean off one of them is completely off the other ones almost off and the other side is not nearly as bad but if you look down the card you should be able to see that this backplate can you can you see write down the card this backplate is bent and this slot air that excuse me this these fingers this tab goes over this way so this is one dead as a doornail RTX 2080 ti I can't promise you won't get banned for it because of the spam spam protection bots that we have but I wouldn't blame you for pressing F because that thing is done yeah it's okay we don't have to oh right yeah there's one more thing that happens so we're gonna make the argument that this was mistreated by the courier because how exactly is it that through this much spacing you would get a dent on the back of the case like that probably complete and utter carelessness so yeah thanks Ivan I'm sorry to be a total downer on our first string after the break here you guys but you know just wanted to share that share that sad story with y'all it looks like is floatplane streaming working now yeah it looks like it's working right it do we know what the issue was no okay so it just started working a loop got it working okay cool all right oh now let's have a look now that's another thing that I always worry about when we do these lives unboxings is I don't know that this actually arrives safely like if you talk to you talk to the BS mods guys for example we've worked with them a fair bit and there's a reason that they actually hand-deliver their mods to almost every trade show and every one that I'm aware of now that I think of it PDX CES they just they just drive their systems there because even packed in a crate when you've got a really heavy system that's a little bit fragile cuz like it's modded it's not you know out-of-the-box that way when you've got a really heavy system that can happen even a small bump is a lot of inertia or like a lot of momentum that you have to stop I mean I guess inertia and momentum they're sort of related it doesn't matter look scientists watching this do I look like a scientist to you look at this Footwear alright oh my god this tape it's like double layers of like the heaviest packing tape I've ever seen but I'm not gonna harp on them for overpacking it like I said it's just kind of a pain in the ass for me right and stuff there we go laughs all right so first things first it looks like they actually went for the sort of reasonable option for the power supply the ax 1200 eye now it's still a 1200 watt ax iSeries Corsair power supply which means it's all digital and blah blah titanium efficiency or whatever is it there's a titanium the 1200 III I don't know it doesn't really matter but it's not the 1600 I like the flagship one because that actually is unnecessary for basically any system we've got our RGB controller remote I'm gonna hold on to that for later we've got our copy of Microsoft Windows 10 Pro gone full Pro on our windows here we've got our accessories including a power cord so yeah this is just all the random accessories for arm Maximus 11 oh that's weird oh that's really weird I had thought interesting I had thought that they were sending over 79 80 or 90 980 XE configuration but they've actually gone pure gamer on this one rather than trying to make it sort of a do all that ends up giving up some gaming performance in order to get better workstation performance by throwing a bunch of you know cores that you don't need for gaming in it fascinating okay so we've got it on to this side up but there is now no way to remove the system other than to turn it the side down so we're gonna do that now a big part of the weight of this thing is the cooling I've actually seen a prototype of this before but not in a video or at least not one that went up on our channel and I didn't really get long to spend with it because it was part of like an Intel contest or something okay even the box is heavy let's have a look at this thing this is like a really really heavy box like it's got a lot of strength to it okay I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry the box fetish can wait all right nice thick foam although I can see why they created this because even with this really heavy closed cell foam I could see this thing stopping too suddenly and shaking something loose I sincerely hope that didn't happen I'm sure I'm sure if any of the digital storm guys are watching right now they're like oh so interesting it looks like they've done one of their trademark come on in here Brendan one of their trademark automotive grade paint finishes and they have done so far one hell of a job of it that is like that is basically perfect look at that not bad now not cheap but not bad that's okay I mean you know you when you have something this expensive you want to make sure that you take care of it okay so I want you to get your Butler to go ahead and you know buffing every once in a while okay his Butler the PC term where is that out kind of like secretary assistant PA I think they're called pas now right personal assistants assistant okay so Butler Butler is out that's an archaic term okay wow it's like monolithic what the hell am I gonna do with it now okay uh Edie we actually have a problem I don't have anywhere to put do you think I can put it on this table maybe maybe if we go real smooth hold on hold on I mean think about it this way one way or another we're giving the people what they want they either want to see the system or they want to see it drop so there's no bad result really okay okay I actually am not sure if I can lift this myself it give me a sec I kind of injured my knee about a month ago playing badminton oh my god that's heavy no I need help Nick fast Nick's here it's fine take an end no no just just an end just an it Justin I'm good I'm good I'm good I'm just not completely good we're putting it on that table that you just holy [ __ ] how the hell could assistant be that heavy I was kind of hoping like some of it was the box and stuff how we're live right now by the way Nick really okay cool um oh my god okay it's just all dark like we can't we can't even really see anything um okay just sec I'm gonna kind of twist it over here so we can do one side at a time it's easier to lift the table than it is to move the system just gonna make sure there's no strain on the legs here anything like that so uh I accidentally ended up with us looking at the backside what do the people in chat wan do you guys want me to pop the panels and give you a look at it first or do you want me to fire it up and illuminate it and then we'll look at it that way guys let me know in the chat in the meantime I'm gonna start undoing these screws in case that's what you'd like to see holy crap like the amount of cooling in this thing that is where we are running into our you know a little too much Christmas dinner weight gain problem we got over here I mean that needs gigantic pieces of tempered glass are not helping things so I'm gonna hold that on with my head now that's using your noggin hey I'm sorry okay what do they want what do the people want dad you gotta help me out you're in the control-room bed pop the battle's I mean you guys are gonna want me to pop the towels oh look at him now some people appreciate the simplicity of a Mac I appreciate having features and cooling to each thrown right okay so what we've got back here is some ridiculous stuff so things that would normally be cooled like down here we've got a dual 140 millimeter radiator with a couple of digital storms these look like Corsairs they've got to be Corsair fans that they've like gonna put their own badging on hold on I'm just gonna use my phone as a mirror and see if the hub has a Corsair logo or they oh it's got of course certainly oddities well no no of course their link works with any fan yeah I just want to get a look at it if I can it's really hard though the angle is not conducive to Dixie not compressing the pixie button traction you know you got to know when you're not wanted Bixby it's not a good time okay yeah I can't I can't see it right now but they look like Coursera rebrands that they've just put their own sticker on which is not a bad thing so that's normal what's not normal is that we've got this cooling fan that remember is almost right up against the last panel so it's kind of just recirculating air cooling I mean he'll I don't know this Corsair link controller module and then we've got this one that is actually dedicated can you see it's ready to come get an angle at this on this that's actually dedicated to the back of the CPU where it mounts to the motherboard because some motherboards actually do have heatsink serve erm components back there and normally they wouldn't get any cooling other than what they get through the copper material that the motherboard is made of conducting heat away from them to somewhere where there is a fan or there is a heatsink so they've got a fan that just blows down on that that's it that's all it does that's all this fan exists to do a 140 millimeter cooling fan alright then they've got some other really cool stuff here in this hall I could already tell this one's got it whoa that was close I'm gonna move this I bumped it when I was it's a cat aquatics right so this has got an RGB strip down it and this is one of the coolest things that I have ever seen done so we showed off the specter Specter case that you could get with a similar kind of design but this is that on steroids so this is a water distribution panel that will be illuminated from the side that basically brings water from up here wherever that goes they've got this fascia piece that's making it kind of hard for me to see so they've got a water distribution a block here that takes it from the top to the bottom of the system and then comes out wherever they need cooling throughout the rest of the system really cool stuff they've also got this like power distribution PCB that they've created this is their own custom PCB up here that I'm not sure exactly what it does but we're gonna go ahead and pop this panel back on them we're gonna how many people are watching 57,000 is that a record I might be that might be a record oh we should probably cover our sponsor who's the first one memory Express what are my talking points is it about their new store in Victoria or their uber price Pete guarantee that allows them to beat authorized Canadian retail prices both online and in-store by ten percent of the difference go checkout memory Express at the link in the video description not now not now we can we can do that later for now I really want to get this thing flipped around and I really need to focus on doing it safely because I don't want to ruin this thing so this is not going to be the full review of this system it's just that this has been sitting here kind of staring me in the face and it's been in this epic crate and I really wanted to open it on camera and we haven't had a good opportunity so I figured we'll do a stream and then we will spend some real quality time with this thing evaluating whether the 48 pounds of cooling or whatever it is they have in this thing is actually worth while or whether it is pure pure status symbol I mean at this point why not both right so we'll see how that goes sorry guys it's just it's taking me a little while to turn it around I just need to be really careful this thing is probably almost or as heavy as the mineral oil cooled machine bare to give you guys some freaking idea like it weighs almost the same as that I swear it you unreal okay am i turned around enough you got a good angle you got light alright so now we get to see the goodies it's fun it's a it's not just any system that that I can get sort of feeling anticipation for these days has seen a lot of gaming systems at this point but the ones that combine being a gaming system with craftsmanship or art like the retro one that Intel had done up those are the ones that are really exciting for me so here we are this is how their water distribution panel works so what it does is instead of running all the tubing bends sort of up through the system obstructing the view of the reservoir or the cards or whatever else we've gone with this approach that allows them to have these straight runs that go down to exactly where they're needed so we've got our labeled but our Inlet and outlet one or the other for our CPU then we've got and can't tell doesn't seem to matter once I flick it on we'll be able to tell but we've got our Inlet and outlet for our graphics cards so these are plumbed up in serial so it's going to go into one then it's gonna go through that block over to the other through this channel that is machined out of this solid block of acrylic here oh that's gorgeous it's completely clear look at this come come come come look at this they've done such a magnificent job of bringing this out and polishing the insides of it this is an ek water block distribution block here so it goes all the way over to the other card through that and then out the other side and then this this is what they're using their panel for so it's actually a pastor Brennan you're gonna have to get low here this is going to be a little bit challenging for you but can you see up there so that that panel is just passing through the cables from the back to the front and they're using their own custom individually sleeved and combed modular cables in order to access the graphics cards here huh now in terms of the spec like I said they actually haven't gone that crazy so these are 28 et eyes like I'm not saying this is a low-end machine this is as fast as it gets sort of you know if you want to spend a while I mean okay you can afford one of these maybe you do go RTX titans I don't know anyway they're not it's not quite but when they built it it definitely was but then they've gone presumably 9900 Kay and then they've actually gone for 3,000 megahertz 32 gigs of just g.skill trident ii RGB like tried tried tested and true RGB memory that's it that's all like no you know 128 gigs of ram or anything stupid like that alright now cooling I soldier I was going to talk about the cooling system so we had that dual 140 millimeter rad on the back in the top we have what appears to be a 1/2 you've got to be kidding me how many is this I love this oh come over here okay oh this is gonna be really hard to see Brandon I'm sorry you got to get down you get to get down get low get low get low check this out that is how that radiator is plumbed they've got another one of their distribution blocks for it here so that's the end and there are that's the the butt end and then this is the tubing end so it comes out into this and then goes out the back into that back flat water backplane there that is unreal so that's a triple 140 we are now up to five 144 millimetre rads worth of cooling capacity and it gets better my friends because down here in a design that actually really reminds me of my old TJ o7 down here they've got a quad 140 millimeter radiator and these are like these aren't but that's really this is a really funny design decision instead of going with the loose Finn arrangement that is more optimized for slowly running fans and okay temperatures they've got a tight thin arrangement that is more optimized for faster rpm fans and just extremely low temps they've gone with a d5 pump and res combo down here so that's running there they haven't gone with any fancy pantsy like coolant tolerance or anything like that those are stupid anyway they eventually gunk up always so you just kind of shouldn't use them water is the way to go in terms of boot drive I can't see what they've put in but they tip throw in a mechanical hard drive up here I don't know what that is doesn't really matter point is let's find out how much RGB this sucker has shall we what do you guys think let's do it ah oh wow okay no I got one more thing to show you Brendan I don't know how well you're gonna be able to see this I'm counting on your excellent camerawork here but can you tell that basically the entire back of this thing is mesh mesh for the power supply mesh for the back of these radiators that are blowing in towards each other as far as I can tell so it's just gonna be passively exhausting out the back mesh here mesh here mesh up here it's all mesh it's all mesh it's gorgeous so all the cooling actually happens at the back because the front as you guys might recall is just that automotive finish and then both sides are tempered glass you know what I'm gonna fire it up with this side off so we can see it full brightness because these are actually kind of like a crap what's it called not God not tinted but like a not darkened smoked these are a smoked cut style of glass so yes tinting would be sort of an accurate word buts smoky is what the appearance looks like so what that does is it kind of it dulls the RGB glare a little bit but still obviously gives you the personalization that you clearly desire because you've got RGB stuff I'm having fun I cut myself that's okay you can never deny that sweat blood and tears have gone into this channel now we're not actually gonna do any benchmarks or anything today that is not the objective of this stream we're gonna save all of that for the full review but I do want to just see it now is there RGB built into the blocks that is something that I do want to know and I do think there is Oh hilarious check this out so the cable management for it is actually quite tidy but they've pulled right off of this RGB header up here on the top of the board and then they've pulled off of a separate one for the from the bottom of the board and each of these blocks is individually RGB with all along I believe it's the vac here or it could also be the bottom it doesn't doesn't it doesn't it looks fair enough it's fair enough ah where's the button ready but no it's okay it's fine it's an Asus double post thing they always do that okay or a triple post thing come on baby there you go you got to get all that RGB initiated [Applause] look at these cards it's not something else or what oh man it's like having a neon sign in your graphics card slides I think of beauty if you're into that sort of thing oh man I love it so where's where'd I put the remote and I think I stashed I stash the RGB remote somewhere so I'm not even sure which lights this remote controls because it won't be the ones to the motherboard that's all gonna be controlled by asus Azara sync application so that will control the RAM and the graphics cards and then the fans I guess that would be through Corsair link I don't know oh okay and then so you've actually got like a multi zone kind of effect here so you've got holy crap no I lied the front of the case does have ventilation you've got another four bloody 140 mm fans in there are those 140 s or 120 s I can't tell I think they might be 120 s actually it's really really hard for me to tell from here might be 140 s and 120 is it looks like these three or 140 s and that one's on 120 or maybe it's offset doesn't matter the point is one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 conveniently they're all lit up for me 12 13 14 15 thing has 15 fans in it not even counting the power supply fan and the pump which is arguably a fan they're very similar in their design okay so you've got multi zone lighting so you can control your video cards which I love the way they put that directly up to the RGB ports on the motherboard you can control your ram through the AC software you can control your course our fans through their link software then you've got your like sort of your back your base mode lighting so you got your green your red your blue I like it in green I think that's looking straight Christmassy I mean seasons kind of over but you know whatever it doesn't matter let's go ahead and throw the other spoke panel on because I've already seen a peek at the back and that looks really really good how hard is this to capture Brandon it's really shiny it's okay now that is a machine for someone with their own Butler sorry excuse me personal assistant thank you we always try to be very PC here at Lynas tech tips get it oh you think that's my new year's resolution that is the last new year's resolution I am resolving to tell more dad jokes in 2019 all right so this gives us a nice look at our our smokey our smokey color scheme here our smoky panel you got to come have a look at the back though because that that water distribution panel that I was telling you was gonna look really good spoiler alert it looks better than I thought so it's all illuminated on this side and it just catches like maybe I'm a freak but I just find a certain beauty in CNC machine and just all those all those like those bolt holes and catching the light like that it just has like an industrial Beauty to me I absolutely love it and again so that zone is controlled in the same as sort of our base case lighting along with all the digital storm logos and event to mechs branding and all that good stuff Oh people want to see what the lights off yeah sure I don't know if we want to go off but maybe I'll dial them down a little bit I think that ones only on or off isn't it Brandon the one with the big ballast okay so we might have to kill that kill that one and then let's see what happens as we dial back the other ones here yeah I'm sorry guys I didn't even think of that before we started how's your lighting Brandon okay we can call that good so I am really excited to see what kind of numbers this thing can pump Oh what kind of cooling I mean this water should be damn near ambient temperature like no matter how much heat you throw at what is it six plus three nine by 140 millimeters worth of radiators I mean that's why this thing is so heavy it's full of water but that's why it weighs as much as an immersion cooled system they're both full of I mean that's mineral oil this is water but you get the point change it to red oh sorry guys there we go how's that you like that better you like it yeah I'll show you all the colors but you know I'm not partial to the blue not that big on the blue although it kind of works with the the yellow scheme that they've apparently pre-programmed no no these are cycling we could just go like full rainbow mode oh wow no it really does it has a it has a unicorn bar setting they're individually addressable Wow well let's turn up the speed then why not go full dance party oh that is hard to look at it's like taking the Mona Lisa and like well putting RGB on there's really nothing you can't make tacky with individually addressable RGB strips right oh man oh well I think that pretty much I think that pretty much wraps it for our stream today yeah I should probably talk to some of my wonderful super chat contributors contributors over there I also want to I also want to tell you about our sponsor for the video today which is loading right now for me give er give er us give her a second OPI a private Internet access okay well I don't have any specific talking points for PIAA because our program isn't really like that so private Internet access it's a good VPN it's affordable you should go check it out at the link below and sign up it's it's great oh also ed wants me to talk about our merch store which I'm wearing this shirt ed I'm already wearing it it's literally right here but he throws me he throws me a shirt to show off to you guys that's literally the shirt I'm wearing hey Gus my guy LT t store comm we've got a new store this surprised me ed this is our second top-selling design even though the only thing that's LTT about it is this like really subtle thing in the constellation wants our lights back on thing in the constellation and then our our sort of new-age circle logo here on the back by the neckline that's the only thing that's ltte about it other than that it's just like a cool shirt it's comfortable to American Apparel oh yeah sorry Brendan here you go Elle tea tea that's it that's the only LT Tina so you can it's pretty much like you can support us but you don't actually have to like put the brand right across your chest like you're a NASCAR driver or something if you like the brand across your chest though these are our these are our second our these are our third and fourth with the black of this design being the top-selling one right now so this is the circuit board logo that I've been wearing for the last few months that's how people haven't had anywhere to buy because we've been working on completely revamping the store for quite a while now so it's LT t store calm you guys can go check that out in the link below and that's it we'll see you guys in like a few hours on when show and I'm gonna oh no I haven't talked to my super chat peeps and then I'm going to hand this over to Alex for the full review treatment here I just just an ad shout out to like everyone not just super chat people like holy crap we had 60 thousand people watching this live stream that's like I don't know what's comparable to that it's like I don't know that's a lot Joe Rogan had 65,000 yesterday okay so what you're saying is I still suck compared to do a Rogan thanks thanks Nick very supportive all right so that's it for the live stream I still suck compared to Joe Rogan but that's okay see you guys see you guys next time edie do you want to stop it alright the super chest we killed digital storm site oh it's a good thing I pre-loaded this page just in case I needed to figure out something about the event - max this is a misrepresentation of the Box digital storm it is much larger and heavier than this just throwing that out there you guys good try but you'll never get the wool over my eyes so super chance Chris F says something about entering to win the contest for the computer oh there is actually a contest for the computer that might not be BS it's their gamer days thing so they might have deaf have their own site by posting in the chat to go there who is it oh there's actually not a lot of there's not a lot of super chats today a lot of new members but yeah there's like nothing really loading so I guess there aren't any oh there were quite a few I'm sorry guys they're they're broken yeah there's only like six okay all right thanks guys see you soon killer dad I'm just standing here awkwardly there's a dead",44:19
K7s1IYVfvSA,Joma Tech,"Tech,Comedy",How I Spend My $250K Software Engineer Income,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7s1IYVfvSA,2 years ago,2.1M views,"Tech,Comedy","[Music] you see the all right so today we are going to talk about money I was inspired by Stephane Graham because he was talking about his multiple income sources but because I'm an idiot or a baller you know tomato tomahto I feel like it's more fitting that I show you guys my reckless spending so as you know I got forty five thousand dollars in bonus with my new software engineering job so what I did was that I took 19 thousand dollars of it and put it into my 401k so that the company dude I'm kidding man dude I'm not a loser I don't do 401ks also you didn't click this video for this you clicked it for my reckless spending so I'm gonna show you so as you can see if I do smiting over time oh it's pretty much a hockey stick I mean usually people would be pretty happy about hockey stick graph but I mean this is my spending so I don't think that's a great thing so as you can see according to this my last month spending was eighteen thousand and nine hundred dollars and well I mean you know I mean we should dig deeper into it because it's not always accurate because sometimes the program they they look at transfers and they think that suspending but it's actually not or I actually spend more and it just wasn't recorded on this program so we're gonna try to export all of that into an Excel spreadsheet and then I'll dive deep into it alright before we continue this video I just want to say that viewers discretion is advice I made this video for entertainment purposes please do not spend all your money recklessly like me and you have to know that my net worth is totally fine it has been growing faster than ever so please spen responsibly do not do like me it's only for entertainment and if you're wondering how's my net worth still growing so fast despite me spending so much well I'm not gonna tell you is it because I'm a trust fund baby I don't know is it because of my bitcoins I don't know enjoy the video alright so I'm having I'm having problems with the autofocus so I'm gonna have to put this in the background so in case you were wondering why I have a bitmoji this is what I use it for alright okay there we go alright so now what we're gonna do is I'm going to rename the description just for ones privacy reasons and also too so that I actually remember what it is because now sometimes the names are quite cryptic it doesn't mean anything so I'm gonna do that first and then secondly what I'm gonna do I'm going to separate them into buckets of spendings because I don't like the preset spendings that they use so I'm gonna bucket them in to birthday gift business expense charity entertainment food I don't effing know materialistic desires medical other rent self-improvement transportation and travel before you ask me what they are I'm gonna go through them okay so don't worry about it and I don't effing know it's just because I didn't want to sort them anymore there were a lot of small purchases from Amazon and I didn't I don't have time I don't have time to search through all of them okay alright so I got it I did a lot of data cleaning cuz you know I'm a I'm a data scientist so I ordered it by the amount spent so you could see it in order of amount spent alright so let's go to the summary now I made a pivot table and then you know a graph because why not honestly it's not even necessary but if you look at the breakdown then the biggest expense is this line here which is materialistic desires which is everything that's related shopping and stuff that need so that is the highest spending with 4000 dollars and then the next highest is entertainment that is like concerts what else it's like concerts comedy shows stuff like that and then here it's like business expense this is relate to like cameras anything that I need to run my youtube channel well I mean I actually don't need it it's more okay fine some of it can go to materialistic spending but it's related to YouTube so I'll put in business expense and then we have food which is a thousand dollars which includes you know restaurants actually it only includes restaurants I mean I never do groceries so it's it's mainly restaurants and then we got rent which is my rent I mean I don't pay 4,600 I don't know if you saw my other video and I said I paid 4,600 chill man I have roommates it was only clickbait okay I only pay 1,900 and then we have self-improvement which is the smallest bucket of my spending for self-improvement I have a personal training and maybe audible or something like that but yeah as you can see I'll spend a lot on that I don't do a lot of self-improvement and then transportation which is like uber and so one thousand dollars dude I might as well rent a Tesla or something [ __ ] so here it says 22,000 I'm not sure if that's true maybe like I'm going to like clean it up a little bit okay so let's look at it deep dive style so monthly rent $1,900 okay the Apple watch atomies 1400 k con la tickets I bought three of them so this shouldn't really be 1300 I should divide this by three so let's see this divided by 3 so then $1,000 for my new bed sheets bedding do that and all that totally worth it because now when I sleep naked it feels like you know so silky hands are all over my body it feels really good and then here is Hamilton ticket I bought a Hamilton ticket for my brother his fiancee and me and yeah it's on me so this one I have to leave it there because even though I bought three of them they're not paying me back all right and then next we have ax owed this is Trevor Noah yeah so for Trevor Noah I bought two tickets that was yeah that was for me and another friend and that cost 964 I can't divide that by two because they're not paying me back okay and then I bought a pic so 3xl it's right here why did I buy it no idea I think it's like it's a hedge you know in case one day Android becomes better than iPhone or that one day iPhones are not cool anymore so at least the transition will be a lot easier for me because I now I use both so it's a lot easier for me to transition into Android when the time comes and then the next spending three of them six hundred and forty dollars that is my flight ticket to Japan because I am going to Japan this year I bought them for my friends but they will pay me back so I will delete these two okay oh wait oh [ __ ] I want to say the joke I wanted to say oh yeah and the reason why I bought three tickets to Japan is because I want both of the seat next to me to be empty so I bought all three of them but no I'm not that rich and then all right $633 this is a business expense it's it's it's kind of like a box it's for doing live videos using my camera I use it for my tech interview probe might as well plug tech interview pro now good news we added new videos about system design and also about how to transition into software engineering and then the reason why I bought this live video thing is that we do live videos every two weeks for the Facebook group and then you can ask us q and A's and stuff like that if you're interested click on tech interview procom all right and then next we got Ticket Master what is this it's five hundred forty-four bucks what did i buy I don't remember [ __ ] the [ __ ] that I by July 4th oh god I got it ok ok ok ok ok got it oh yeah so I bought tickets for Ali Wong front seat ok actually not friend see the the road before the front seat because I don't want to get I don't want them to talk to me while they do their show because I always get nervous so next we have wow that's a lot we have for Facebook charges two of them is for advertising I mean you know how do you expect my channel to grow you really think that I make good content which is how I grow my channel don't be so naive I pay for my subscribers and then the other two is for Mental Health America which is a charity I'm doing a fundraiser and I put in five hundred dollars it's not a thousand so this is wrong because I kind of did it twice by accident so it's only five hundred dollars I'll talk about that later I don't wanna I don't want you guys to think I'm a good person or anything alright and then oh four hundred forty dollars that is my virtual assistant I pay for a virtual assistants so that they can manage my calendar they can respond to some emails they can help me do some invoicing and stuff like that very useful highly recommend it if you're rich and then the next one Taman that's actually just a guitar so I bought a guitar you can see it right here yeah ticka ticka do let's see and then I got a lot of business expense here is a pure bird press van no what the [ __ ] did I buy WordPress I don't know okay so some of it is pretty dumb okay I guess you got the gist of it you got the bulk of my spending and let's go back to the pivot table and see how it looks it's not that bad it's it's it's it's still $19,000 okay mmm crazy thing honestly I am okay with everything but what the hell transportation is so high let me look at that so clearly I like uber more but holy [ __ ] $1000 is that right dude I spent $1,000 in a month horse [ __ ] did I might as well just pay for a Tesla or something oh you know what you live and learn alright anyways I'm gonna wrap this video in terms of money-wise so as you can see travel $900 it's not that bad actually transportation $1,000 I could do better in that self-improvement I shouldn't worry about spending more in self-improvement but clearly I don't care about my self-improvement that much rent 1900 I can't change anything those are some utility costs whatever other I don't want to go into that but wait what is another let me go check cash advance intra don't know what that is virtual assistant was another all made cleaning service I also put that other that's I recommend that too especially if you're lazy right so okay that's it's not that bad I'm not gonna change anything they're entertainment I don't want to I don't want to change that because entertainment is important right let's go back into entertainment I want to see what I pay for entertainment yeah like like totally worth it right Spotify I have to Showtime gotta Hamilton tickets you know it's for my brother it's important Vanda go movie totally important I don't know what in-flight Wi-Fi that's important too patreon on the white says Jim but patreon I got to support the patreon members Tiffany young tickets kpop really important we're gonna skip this one we're gonna skip that one Nintendo Digital I could take that off it's only four dollars Trevor Noah thought that was worth it I was really new on that I mean what are you gonna do for your money if you're not gonna have fun with it Cate con la tickets totally worth it Ali Wong totally worth it so yeah I'm not gonna change anything in my entertainment business expense dude it's business expense manse you know to recap yes I spent a lot this month but that's probably not every month I hope and there's two reasons why I spend so much the first reason is consumption smoothing all right it's an econ term learn it every time every time I spend too much that's my excuse I'm just doing consumption smoothing and then the second reason is I don't plan on saving for retirement because I'm banking on the fact that one of my investments will pan out and will make me rich so that saving a few thousands here and there would be irrelevant Oh what kind of investments dogs real estate bitcoins no you plebs okay I'm investing in my future kids I'm banking on the fact that one of them will be extremely rich and that will pay dividends to me it didn't work out for my parents but I'm optimistic for my kids I should really call my parents ooh a new kpop video anyways now I want to talk about the charity section so I got all these corgis from A Thousand skies so thank you so much but I don't know what to do with them I'm not gonna keep them in my place forever so I decided to give them out in exchange for a donation to my fundraiser in Mental Health America so that's when I decided to donate five hundred to bootstrap my fundraiser so that it doesn't look like a total failure if I don't have anyone donating so if you're in the Bay Area SF Bay Area you could you know for a small donation even just two bucks you can just give two bucks and then I could personally hand you the Corgi and I could meet you and I could give you a corgi but if you're not in the SFO area unfortunately I can't deliver it to you but if you really want when you could go on thousand skies calm in case you want to know they're not paying me for this I just really really like the corgis because there's a sentimental value to it if you watch my videos from the beginning you would understand why it's because many times I interacted with the Corgi on one of my videos that went really really popular and I kind of associate my success to these corgis and yeah and I kind of want to pay homage to it anyways that's it for now the video is long enough unless I edit it really well I'm not sure but thanks for watching really appreciate it and I'll leave some links down below like for example the fundraiser link and a thousand sky's link and yeah I hope you enjoy it so I'll leave you with this don't spend recklessly spend responsibly but remember self-worth before network yeah [Music]",15:58
vHuFizITMdA,NileRed,Science,Turning cotton balls into cotton candy,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHuFizITMdA,5 months ago,6.7M views,Science,about two years ago i became convinced that there was a way to turn cotton balls into edible and hopefully tasty cotton candy at first this idea seemed a bit ridiculous but i knew that it should have been possible this is because cotton even though it doesn't seem like it at all is technically entirely sugar the only problem is that all this sugar or more specifically glucose is trapped in something called cellulose as cellulose it acts like a completely different material and we can use it to make things like cotton balls and clothing at its core though it's all just sugar so what i dreamed of doing was breaking down cotton balls back into sugar and then turning them into candy i didn't just want to make any candy though and i specifically wanted to make cotton candy i wanted to make literal cotton candy to get started the first thing that i had to do was figure out how to even do it i had to come up with a way to break down the cellulose back into sugar and my first idea was to use an enzyme this was because i had already used an enzyme for another project where i turned toilet paper into drinkable alcohol and it had worked really well for that one i used an enzyme called cellulase and i was able to break down the toilet paper which is also entirely cellulose this gave me a solution of sugar which i fermented to alcohol using yeast and then i distilled it to make my toilet paper moonshine the whole process ended up being surprisingly efficient and i figured it was the best place to start the only issue was that the enzyme i'd used wasn't pure and it was mixed with maltodextrin and cornstarch both of these were sugars but they weren't fermentable by yeast so none of it turned into alcohol and they didn't at all interfere with that project however for this one i couldn't have any extra sugar floating around it would be almost impossible to separate it from the sugar that i made and it would just be a huge mess i had to find somewhere to buy the pure enzyme and the easiest and cheapest source seemed to be alibaba it was pretty easy to go on find a listing and order the enzyme but actually getting what i wanted turned out to be a huge pain the first and biggest problem was that i never knew if it was actually going to be sugar-free i always asked and they would confirm that it was but it never seemed fully believable also the canadian government kept seizing the packages and holding them for months this one by far had to be the worst one that i got customs had apparently torn it open and repackaged it by just throwing it into a loose plastic bag it was also brown which immediately told me that it wasn't very pure and i could tell there was sugar in it because it was sticky when i touched it it took months but i eventually got one that seemed decent and it of course arrived as ginseng extract it was an off-white but still pure powder and it didn't seem to have any fillers or sugars when i tried it on the cotton though it just didn't work very well i think the enzyme itself was good quality and the cotton was just really stubborn i knew that it would be a bit harder to break down than toilet paper but i didn't expect it to be as bad as it was i was never really able to do it and after trying for a while i basically gave up about a year later though i got really inspired for some reason and i decided to attempt this project again i read every single book article or paper that i could find and i slowly put something together my biggest challenge was that i didn't want to have to use any specialized equipment or weird chemicals and i wanted it to be as simple as possible i also ideally wanted the sugar that i made to taste good or at the very least not poison me after about a week i ended up coming up with something that i thought could work instead of using enzyme to break down the cotton i would just use acid and the process seemed to be surprisingly simple so i decided to just jump right into it and i picked up an entire bag of cotton balls i went with the large ones just because i felt like it and it looked like a lot but it was only about 77 grams now the next main ingredient that i needed was some 98 concentrated sulfuric acid for all this cotton i calculated that i needed 230 grams of it and i poured it directly onto 70 grams of ice this almost immediately caused most of the ice to melt and when it was all added i turned on the stirring what i was doing here was just diluting the sulfuric acid and bringing the concentration down from 98 to 75. i also used ice to do this because it generated a lot of heat and the whole solution was now probably around 60c or 140 fahrenheit if i'd used regular water instead of ice it probably would have violently boiled and splashed which wouldn't have been ideal but anyway when it looked like it was all mixed i turned off the stirring and i let it cool down to room temperature about 30 minutes later it was good to go and i pulled out the stir bar it was now time to add the cotton and i started with just one ball i then poked it around a bit and it almost immediately started falling apart in general cotton's usually pretty tough and i thought that it was interesting to see it just disintegrate it only took a minute for it to become a little gooey blob and i felt that i was ready to add the rest so i carefully loaded in a small handful and it looked like it was barely gonna fit at first this was a bit concerning because this was only a small fraction of what i had to add with just a bit of poking around and stirring though it slowly disappeared into the acid i then continued adding the rest of the cotton and i was honestly a bit worried that it wasn't gonna be able to eat the whole bag now as far as i know there was no major reaction going on here and the cotton was just getting dissolved i wasn't able to find much info about it but it seems like the sulfuric acid was probably just interacting with the cellulose it was forming a complex around their hydroxyl groups which normally help the fibers stay tightly packed together this was causing them to separate and fall apart and dissolve into the acid it really didn't seem like it was gonna work but i was able to fit the whole bag now at this point things were looking pretty good but to fully dissolve the cotton i had to warm it up a bit so i dropped it into a hot water bath at 50c and i let it sit there for 30 minutes when it was done it looked like all the cotton had disappeared and i pulled it out of the bath i then poured it into 456 milliliters of boiling hot water this diluted the acid even more and it brought it down from the 75 percent that i had before to 27 i then washed out the beaker with a bit of water to make sure that i transferred everything and i added a thermometer i now had to keep this at 85c and even though it didn't look like much was happening it was the most important step in the other one the cotton had just been dissolved but here it was actually getting chopped up the long cellulose fibers were being attacked by the acid and water and they were breaking the bonds between the sugar units this type of reaction is called a hydrolysis reaction and they were breaking it down into smaller and smaller pieces i had to keep it running like this for two hours and in that time it should fully break down into glucose when it was done it looked about the same and i poured all of this into an even larger beaker this one was surrounded with ice to help cool things down but it was still gonna take a while so in the meantime i prepared something else that i needed i went and got some of my food-grade calcium carbonate which is basically just chalk i would be using this to neutralize all the sulfuric acid but i couldn't just throw it in as a powder i had to make it into a slurry and based on my calculations i needed about 245 grams so i measured that out and added 125 ml of water i then stirred it around and after a few minutes it was good to go when everything eventually cooled down to around room temperature i started adding the goopy chalk it reacted almost immediately with the sulfuric acid and it was releasing a lot of co2 gas this was all being generated as the acid was being neutralized and the acid itself was turning into calcium sulfate the only problem was that i had to add the chalk in small amounts or else it would bubble out of the beaker this was a very slow process and it was going okay until it eventually got a bit too thick this happened because the calcium sulfate was practically insoluble in water and it was all separating out so to fix this i occasionally added some extra water to loosen things up and it seemed to help i also added some more water to the chalk and i slowly added the rest of it at some point it really started looking way too much like iced coffee and it was a bit scary how much i wanted to taste it that would have been a horrible idea though and it would have tasted absolutely awful but anyway i was eventually done adding the chalk and when i tested the ph it told me that it was roughly neutral what i had now was hopefully a mixture of calcium sulfate and dirty sugar water and the next step was to filter it i poured in as much as i could into the filter but it wasn't even close to fitting everything i was only able to add what looked like half of it and i was gonna have to do this in two batches after loading up as much as i could i turned on the vacuum and i started pulling out the water this was all being drained into a flask below the filter and i was getting some nice and clear dark liquid when the stuff in the filter looked dry i added some water i then mixed it around and i was doing this to wash out any sugar that might have been stuck in the calcium sulfate this was then all pulled through and i washed it a second time now i had to deal with the other half of the stuff so i washed the filter and i added everything that was left in the beaker it was all just barely able to fit and i turned on the vacuum just like before i pulled it all through and i washed it twice with some water in the flask below i was left with a bunch of dark liquid this was all hopefully some dirty sugar water but up until now i had no idea if i had actually made any sugar to figure this out though it was actually pretty easy and i just had to use a glucose test strip this is normally used to check for sugar in pee and i was a bit worried that it would tell me that there was nothing however it actually gave me some really good results it told me that there was for sure glucose in there and that there was probably a decent amount the only problem was that it was still full of impurities side products and leftover acid and what i had to do next was try and clean it up a bit to do this i figured the easiest way was to use something called a mixed ion exchange resin at first this might sound a bit fancy and it kind of is but it's actually super simple to use it's also commonly used to purify aquarium water so it's pretty cheap and quite easy to buy i got all my resin from amazon and all i did was put it in this plastic tube now to clean the dirty sugar solution i just had to pour it through as it passed over the resin it pulled out anything that was charged and this included things like acid and salts the sugar itself though was a neutral molecule and it shouldn't have been affected by it it even got rid of some of the color and after just one run it was looking a lot lighter i then swapped out the beaker for another container and i passed it all through again i was doing this just to really make sure that i pulled out as much junk as possible when it was done i washed the resin with some extra water and at this point it should have been relatively pure besides the obvious orange color there should have been practically no salts or acid however the main issue now was that there was still way too much water and i had to get rid of most of it so after pouring it all into this large dish i threw it into a food dehydrator this is normally meant for things like peppers or fruit and it's basically just a warm box with a fan i then ran it until i felt that it was low enough which ended up taking about 35 hours after that i took it out and i poured it all into a beaker it was just slightly over 400 mils and now that it was more concentrated it was a bit darker it was also slightly acidic and it had a bit of a weird smell this unfortunately meant that i had to go back to the ion exchange resin this time though i did it in a different tube that i made from a water bottle this one had a valve at the bottom that i could close so everything wouldn't pass through right away i also included a bunch of activated charcoal along with the resin which i was hoping would help with the smell in color after everything was added i stirred it around and then i let it sit there i wasn't sure how long i had to leave it and based on almost nothing i decided that 5 hours was probably good over that time i just randomly stirred it every so often and it did get noticeably lighter when it hit the 5 hour mark i opened the valve and i drained everything out i washed everything with a bit of extra water and it was now hopefully cleaner the only thing that i didn't like was that it looked a bit cloudy to fix this i tried pouring it through some cotton and sea light but i don't think that did much of anything in any case what i had now was still way better and it no longer had a weird smell it basically just smelled like water and it also wasn't acidic the only issue was that there was still way too much water so i put it back into the dehydrator i then ran it until it looked like it was almost all gone when i felt that it was done i pulled it out and i put it into an even smaller container this one was made of silicone and if i had made any sugar i was hoping that it wouldn't stick to it after that i put it back in and i ran it until it looked like the volume stayed constant when it eventually looked like it was done i took it out i was really hoping to see some nice and crunchy sugar but that of course wasn't the case only this part in the corner kind of looked like it was solid i thought that maybe it was just having a hard time crystallizing so i covered it and i put it in the freezer for a couple days when i took it out i thought that it was looking really promising however it wasn't it was all goopy and honestly a bit disappointing but i was still kind of happy even though it wasn't nice and crunchy the texture more or less confirmed that it was sugar there weren't very many other things that i could have made here that would be sticky and gooey like this i wasn't exactly sure why it wasn't completely solid but i figured it was probably because i just didn't dry it enough there was still some water in there making it all sticky and unfortunately i had to get it out if i tried putting this into a cotton candy machine it would be an absolute mess to dry it i put together this little setup which is just an upside down tray on a hot plate with a baking sheet on top i then scraped off all the sugar which totally stuck to the silicone and i transferred it all here i slowly turned up the heating and i brought it up to just above 100 c to boil off the water i let it bubble like this for a while and after several minutes it was probably pretty dry i still wasn't done though because even with it dry i knew that it still wouldn't work to make cotton candy this was because i had already done a few basic tests using pure glucose and it had completely failed i had no idea why but it only seemed to work when the glucose was partially caramelized so i slowly raised the temperature of the hot plate and i brought it up to 185 c under this high heat the sugar was hopefully caramelizing which actually meant that it was re-polymerizing this was basically the exact opposite of what i did to make the sugar and i was rebuilding them back into slightly longer chains it would still be edible though and it would never go back to being like cotton my only issue here was that i had no idea how long i had to heat it for and i was also really afraid of burning it i ended up letting it go until i felt that it looked good which took about an hour i then pulled it off the hot plate and i waited for it to cool down to room temperature after half an hour it looked exactly the same and for a second i thought that it was still all goopy when i poked at it though it was completely solid and it also looked and felt like candy i was pretty happy with how it turned out and it was a lot more sugar than i needed it was also a lot more than i ever expected to get especially after my failures with the enzyme however the yield was technically kind of crappy and i only got about 20 grams in theory i probably should have gotten at least 50. this meant that i had lost a lot along the way and i honestly have no idea where it went i'm thinking that a lot of it might have gotten trapped in the exchange resin or in all the calcium sulfate or maybe in general the process just wasn't super efficient either way i never expected this process to be amazing and 20 grams was more than enough i was also honestly still kind of amazed that i'd even managed to get any sugar at all even though i had done this all myself i still thought that it was hard to believe that this used to be a bag of cotton balls one thing though was that i still wasn't 100 sure that this was sugar i mean i had tested it with a glucose strip but i felt that there was only one way to fully confirm it up until now i had completely resisted tasting it and i was really anxious to try it if there was anything else in there it would probably taste really bad or sour and i was honestly kind of expecting that to happen okay so i guess i'll just taste one of the little pieces mmm it tastes pretty good it's just caramelized sugar yeah that's it that's my whole review done okay so it was actually a lot better than i expected and it didn't even have a hint of a weird flavor but anyway i guess it was now time to try and turn it into cotton candy to do this i figured that all i needed was a cotton candy machine and i bought one from amazon now in theory based on the instructions all i had to do was wait for it to heat up and drop in my sugar so i waited for about 5 or 10 minutes and i nervously took out my precious little pieces i then dropped some in and i turned on the spinner i was really hoping to see some nice puffs of cotton candy but that didn't happen all it did was shoot out a sad brown liquid when i saw this i was honestly pretty disappointed yeah and i wasn't sure why it failed it just shot it all out it just shot it was liquid sugar i just picked it based on my small tests i was really expecting it to just work but then again i'm not some sort of cotton candy master cut it didn't work see that's what i feared i ended up trying it a few more times and it just never seemed to work at first i had no idea why it was failing like this but i started thinking that the melting point of my candy was just too low if that were the case it might just be having a hard time freezing as it flew through the air this machine was designed for table sugar or sucrose which melts at 186 but glucose melts around 146 c and my sugar was probably even lower i was hoping that this would have been fixed by caramelizing it but i guess i didn't caramelize it enough i think it just has to be more caramelized so i scraped off all the sugar from my sad and failed attempts and i put it back onto the silicone baking sheet i then heated it up again to about 200 c i had no idea how long i had to cook it for and again i was a bit afraid of burning it over 20 minutes it darkened a bit more and when i eventually felt that it was good i took it off the heat i then let it cool down like before and i broke it into a bunch of smaller pieces okay so i was now ready to try again and i was kind of expecting the same results in theory the caramelization should have fixed things but i was a bit scared because if it didn't i was kind of out of ideas there was only one way to find out though and i dropped some pieces into the machine [Music] i then turned it on and now i just had to wait in the meantime i got ready by climbing up on my little ladder it was a little awkward but i found that reaching over the camera was the only decent way to film this i was half expecting it to almost immediately just shoot out as goo again but that didn't seem to be happening in fact it didn't seem to be doing much of anything [Applause] taking a lot longer i kept waiting and i was a bit worried that it would just burn or something but then there was suddenly a bunch of nice fluff i then quickly used the stick and i tried collecting it and it was actually working the first thing that i noticed though was that it looked a lot thicker than regular cotton candy i mean it was all yellow and the machine sounded like it was dying but it was still pretty exciting when it eventually looked like it wasn't making anymore i turned off the machine oh my god okay so apparently that worked and even though it was probably the saddest and most pathetic cotton candy i'd ever seen i was still really happy with it i also really wanted to know how it tasted i mean it tastes like regular cotton candy just a lot more burnt it's not bad but it's also not good the only major issue with it besides looking and tasting like industrial grade cotton candy was that it didn't last very long even though it was able to solidify it seemed like it wanted to melt in just a few minutes it had shrank quite a bit and it had gotten a lot harder all the work all of my work to get this before it completely died though i broke off a piece of it and i compared it to a cotton ball in my opinion they were shockingly similar and the cotton candy kind of just looked like a really used and dirty one but anyway in the end i guess i was successful at turning cotton balls into cotton candy i mean it wasn't the most efficient transformation and the quality wasn't exactly the best but it was still a lot better than i expected and i'm really happy with how it turned out for now though i think i'm done messing around with sugar and i'm gonna focus on some other projects like turning plastic gloves into hot sauce okay so now is when i would normally have a sponsorship but i've decided not to have one for this video instead i want to take the time to announce that i'm finally selling t-shirts again the first shirt is the original design that i sold years ago and there have been a lot of people wondering where it went the other one is a new design and personally i like how it's nice and discreet right now these shirts will only be available for two weeks and i'm not sure if or when they'll be available again so if you want to pick one up or just support the channel there's a link in the description my goal in general with this is to be more self-sustaining and to not rely on sponsorships anymore but i guess i'll have to see how this goes as usual a big thanks goes out to all my supporters on patreon everyone who supports me can see all my new videos at least 24 hours before i post them to youtube you'll also get access to all the older videos that i had to take down and if you support me with five dollars or more you'll get your name at the end like you see here so [Music] you,29:52

for you take the rest of these actually these guys have anything in here baby yeah there's died heard glass break yeah that was over herself at that long house and there was someone coming from north it's crazy that this guy lived a guy that down me should not have killed me well you know that's fine Pub G hope you just taken away massive gains getaways to go it looks like maybe like I had that building strolling maybe there's a knife a gun no no he was shooting me in the back and then he bailed that's the glass break he just jumped out he's probably just hiding somewhere so glad he'll know we need a car that's the guy under me dude oh my god cough cough prema dreamers and coffee free advice later please that's gotta crawl down there's a guy under me right now no but he's under me somewhere my garage Roger no friendly [Music] [Music] Hausa no that was the guy that yeah the gather down me please have meds for everyone everyone Kim is on me there's no missing good so all cuz I heard that control under me and then you never know you never know if it's a troll or not so I did like a quick peek I would have not played it like that but I was forced into that situation because of that can guy under me that I heard and you don't know if it's a troll or not right just have to assume it is the hell those two bodies were lit there's two bodies over there with mad meds there's well not mad but first date in a Med um what's the what you have is freaking man all right well it's time to I was crazy I'm just so shocked that all of us are alive yeah went down a couple times my next down is get our hurt dude I'm gonna hit this Mirada got it where the [ __ ] I am Oh Lord for that morado up down are we going for that car is our Oh I thought your I was very confused I want a coffee flavor tastes like Shravan in the fridge yes yes we do actually I got a crack mine right now he did the job before he left that's funny now I want one man I actually what I really want is I want some hot coffee but it's just you know it's a longer process and I mean I can't just go downstairs and get it oh please don't run us over yeah we're good oh yeah you're just cruising by don't mind that guy did I did I know I saw you I saw you jump before you leave getting a loot and that was uh oh yeah nothing shroud should hire an intern that'd be great what what what just happened guys freakin meds though Jesus old scar date me brings the house moving let's go dude that guy best be up bad immediately just took me to 1 hp I'm just a punching bag that's so Oh oh my god yeah you're right it's all in the water what the hell go into the islands baby it could cards I can't really hear you good [Music] they push it let me push it no doesn't work like that huh I feel the fragget good just get the three seater or we could push it with the appreciator just a jacket an intern just know that an intern at that boy would assist in I don't know why people were calling an intern that's not what that would be it'd be more of an assistant should I just get one for the house yeah you know it'll be for me before you if Jess whatever we want hey can you get this for us okay hey I got a morado back oh nice this thing is so loud it's too loud you already have Jess Wow Jess would never give me a damn thing I don't so now we're Auto versa bite you know I'm sorry hold on hold on alone my

I'm flanking right okay if I die bury me bury me with a lot of Audrina there oh god what else I think by coming in life does not have a blast yeah what the oh my Patrol I think a trucks covered he's trolling though I think team East yeah you're kind of a loner I need to loop these guys I'm running back to us let's and other trolls are all partied up together dude's got a gross a man's not hot finally this guy's meds got none of course yeah no that was a level one guy knocked oh this guy over here did yeah I have four first dates that they didn't have much for first dates three boost you need any I would take any of that any of that you can spare that circle dude what whoa this is like only 15% laughs all right well water for me all right P novo is on the north west side or not novo Puerto is on the northwest side of this circle that's ridiculous should be an interesting game there's still a lot of people left I think so yeah it's pretty good pound to our northeast there's that besan that you're by there's like at least two teams in that compound all right have lights this is gonna be this next circle after this is this is gonna get ridiculous it's got to be the same there's no way it's gonna be worse than this it's literally just got to be on top of I mean it it could be just you know it could just be in the water again and it just has like two houses anything oh boy oh hello Susan okay catch a rat shots to our West Flyboys fly why [Music] this is drop in the water there I'm sleepy free madri's - nice mocha please - we thank you for the dodo your Boca kind of guy huh I'll see what I could do okay I'll see what I could do for you right there northeast I'm I'm not there you're right here right here right here I'm because I'm just in the [ __ ] right here I'm gonna sit right here I'm not gonna move is one of the right yeah 2:45 we should get into the city I'm I'm gonna get a little hit me so I can't do anything up here I'm getting you guys are gonna get shot from like all sides if you stay up there literally somewhat breeds on me marinas coffee advice is your name haha that's good that is good at the height in the height but on the right why would they not stop and shoot at us towards the water switch Watertown South okay apparently that's not a kill gonna be like I hit him in the window he's one of those houses you go check out those bodies for meds and invest I got the guy in the window over there oh shoot I lost my helmet that's good feels good man my shots are just going through people feels good man I don't like them no helmet thing here I'll tie if there's one here on this guy at least yep a little too over here okay see if I can get it a little get your cover from this warehouse one guy in the door trying to peek you don't have any extra meds that they have a whole bunch I got the first AIDS and a stem take this take this this stem these I got something I mean I has a bandages I'm gonna try to push it Lily I'm running right at it right now yeah there we go left window we are good yeah that guy that jumped out to the left kind of screwed them up I shall take more so six can't hurt so are here this is kind of scary to run down run down the right I guess it's okay all my shots were suppressed I didn't hear anything I went down just fine all right four laps could be just one I'm trying to like get around this team you know shoot him in the butt play in any way we don't have to follow me oh my god that piece of paper scared me probably just in these houses here to the 65 north they're hiding somewhere dude maybe in here a little stack of five houses like in the center of the zone hey there he's in there hey that only three left like I know where what is pretty good Dave it's not a good take that back for sure he's in here sunglasses that one of you guys it's kneading everything probably this the house that you're running right to if I had to guess is long one me oh sure mom all right there's a guy in here he just has it he's not moving much I'm not sure let's find out yeah I'll do you something I don't think he's in there because you probably would have died to that it's like one of my best friends they're doing a great job hiding right now get her some and then they're not trying their stroller I'm talking it's right now yeah they're probably just hiding probably just hiding in the house somewhere I have moved just maybe here thrown somewhere I think you're right there's trolls what what is he throwing I'm running at him I'm gonna try to pan him okay oh wait no he's sure he's surely he's jolly what the heck was that game I had 20 what do you have you're 13 or what is that math 17 kills,30:52
S_doxRtYd8o,Captain Disillusion,Informative,"""Rush Hour"" EXPLANATION",1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_doxRtYd8o,6 years ago,2.6M views,Informative,"[audience applause] Hi, welcome back to Captain Disillusion, where truth meets fiction,
and fiction meets my fist. -What?
-[audience laughing] I’m Captain Disillusion, your guide
to all things real and observable. -[audience cheering]
-And I’m Mr. Flare, lens artifact of light,
lenticular clothing expert, and actor. Really? You tread the celluloid boards? Since when? You have to tell us more! Well, as you know, I’ve done some work
in several J. J. Abrams pictures. Ah, yes. Some would say too much. Exactly. And that’s why I decided
to go back to my indie roots and do a few short films. That’s literally amazing. And I understand you brought a clip. Why don’t you set that up for us? Well, no one literally brings a clip,
it’s arranged by a publicist -and downloaded to--
-What’s the film called? It’s called Rush Hour. Oh, I love that movie! Do you understand the words
that are coming out of my-- -No, no. Not that one.
-[audience laughing] This is a web video directed by
filmmaker Fernando Liv-- [bleep]. Roll the goddamn clip, Charlie. [“Mr. Sandman” by The Chordettes plays] -[audience applause]
-Wonderful! So much fun. Yeah, my job was easy. Just hang there and look pretty. The stunt drivers are the real heroes. Stunt drivers? Yeah, didn’t you see? All that amazing coordinated driving? [audience laughing] -Oh, no. No you don’t.
-[audience boos] I let you promote your film
because this is a talk show today, but I draw the line at fake claims. -Okay…
-If you want to spin a yarn, better call a gossipy weaver,
because this is my house. -[audience cheering]
-We deal in truth. And we all know that was a fake video
done with the visual effects skills of a handsome Argentinian man. What we don’t know
is exactly how it was done. But I’m gonna tell us. I’m gonna tell all of us. There ain’t no such thing
as a free lunch. If you film something
from a completely stationary angle, it’s easy to digitally manipulate. But it also tends to look fake
to your young, media-conditioned eyes. If the camera is moving, manipulation becomes
much more complicated, but it ends up looking more convincing. But what if I told you that you could have
the best of both worlds with very little effort? Just film your scene
with a stationary camera, manipulate it,
and then add fake camera movement. That’s what Fernando did. He filmed moving camera shots
for the beginning and the end, and seamlessly transitioned them into a stationary shot
of the main visual effects portion where he animated fake
subtle camera movement and zooming. Did you notice that what looks like
a tiny smudge on the lens at the beginning later looks like a stain on the pavement
because it moves with the picture? So let’s put that aside
and consider this a stationary shot. What he actually filmed
was a semi-busy street where individual vehicles and pedestrians
passed by at different times. Something like this. After that, he picked
several candidate cars and people and meticulously traced them
frame by frame in a process
old people called “rotoscoping,” and cool, hip visual effects artists call
“pulling a matte.” He had to do this because eventually he would make many copies
of different subjects cross each other so every edge of each had to be defined. Now, pulling a matte doesn’t have to be
a brute force tracing effort, especially if you don’t have a whole team
of inexpensive overseas artists to handle it for you. There are various time-saving techniques
you can use. Enhancing luminance values to define edges, smart selection tools, or, particularly useful in this case, a difference matte. A difference matte effect learns what pixels
of the stationary background look like, then spots and isolates
the different-looking pixels of moving objects that cross it. It doesn’t work perfectly,
but it gets you a lot of the way there. Once all the subjects were matted, it was time for Fernando
to play compositing jazz. He combined and offset
various copies of different vehicles to pass each other centimeters apart to a delightful old-y tune that…

02X3ZLUsojU,Hardware Canucks,Tech,Top 5 Gaming Mice,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02X3ZLUsojU,7 years ago,2.2M views,Tech,"this video is brought to you by NCIX.COM
great technology selection and service hello everyone this is Dmitry with
Hardware Canucks and I just realized that we have produced and surpassed 400
videos released on this channel so give us a like if you'd want to see 400 more
now this has given us many opportunities to highlight some of the best top
quality and value for many products out there so in this episode we're doing a
top 5 gaming mice to consider if you're looking to upgrade your current Mouse or
just looking to get a sense of what is available on the market now these are
not in any particular order but instead we hope to provide an objective top 5
gaming mice that we have reviewed and starting with number one the rocket ion
now you can click on the name on the top right corner to view our full reviews on
each of these mice but this one seriously has one of the best button
layouts you can find on the mouse with awesome easy shift plus functionality
that adds secondary commands to each of your buttons there's a tilt joystick for
aircraft control and there's also a fence switch that isn't very comfortable
to use but could serve helpful for additional macros the ergonomics are
top-notch with proper thumb inserts curvature of the top frame with a slant
to the right to properly support your palm and I love the scroll wheel it has
very distinct scroll steps and is also light enough to press there is something
I consider crucial for a gaming mouse now this is a laser option but with
proper configuration in the software the tracking is super precise without
noticeable acceleration and let's not forget the awesome rim lighting that you
can actually see while you're using the mouse if you got the means to afford
this $99 product we would highly recommend this to get on your list now
for number two we've got the asus rog Gladius this is their latest gaming
mouse as of making in this video and it's got a lot going for it the grippy
sides allow light holding with good support along with proper thumb rest and
extra form on the opposite side to accommodate for your ring and pinky
fingers the optical sensor used in this mouse is considered one of the best on
the market and if you have committed to optical mice you would definitely love
this the scroll wheel and quick dpi change behind it are tactile and allow
users to switch between two dpi without needing to cycle through as even
one eye game I use only two DPI steps to increase it in decrease it if I get into
a vehicle and if I exit and the best part about the Gladius would be the swap
well on run switches as ASUS includes an extra pair that you can replace
yourself for a different resistance click on either primary buttons and you
can even mix them up to suit your resistive map reference the red lighting
looks sexy to suit the rog color scheme and the Gladius is a strong contender
within this list that should be considered just for $79 moving on to
number three Mionix Avior 7000 and Mionix NAOS 7000 now I've grouped these
two together as they use an identical sensor and just vary in the form as you
can't avoid the left hand users so for those who require that left hand
operation the Avior 7000 is a good place to start
the NAOS 7000 has been my daily driver ever since release and I've come to
appreciate that slightly wider body that fits my hand like a glove for that thumb
support and both ring and pinky fingers covered in a soft touch coating both
mice offers superb build quality but don't be thrown off by the lightweight
it is unfortunate there is no weight customization but you quickly can adjust
to the lightweight for both the Avior and the nails they use outstanding
switches for your primary left and right click and excellent site browser buttons
for soft roll off that provide tactile actuations but continue to travel inside
the body that prevents it from affecting your aim this is a brilliant feature the
optical sensor used here provide outstanding tracking given you combine
this with a proper dark hard surface mat for best results and finally the subtle
lighting features of an illuminated logo and the scroll wheel are super
appreciated with full RGB spectrum that allows seamless color matching to the
rest of your setup and at $79 both the Avior and the NAOS 7000 form a
well-rounded bundle for lefties and an extremely comfortable Mouse experience
on the nails as well coming in at number four we have the CM Storm Mizar for
those on the limited budget but still want the proper ergonomic design good
switches and the trusted Avago 9800 laser sensor so the Mizar might be a
way to go you get RGB illumination on the mouse a proper Glide feet at the
bottom and rubberized sides for a better grip along with large browser buttons
for your thumb the scroll wheel is not the best at least not as nearly as good
as with the other mice on this list but the dpi change buttons behind the scroll
wheel are appreciated with good access that for sure will come
in handy and for $59 the CM storm is our rounds off the features with a trusted
layout to still be competitive and on the last gaming mouse on the list at
number 5 is the logitech g502 proteus core this is an extremely popular mouse
for gamers that offer outstanding ergonomics with deep curve for your
thumb and proper top surface curvature for comfortable handling now for larger
hands due to such a slim profile you might not find it as comfortable but
this would be a total killer profile for smaller hands all of the switchers are
outstanding with really fast primary switches for FPS titles for example
quick dpi levels with LED indicators and a sniper button to quickly activate your
preferred sensitivity when it is pressed this is also the only Mouse in this list
with customizable weights that comes with a storage compartment and that's
really appreciated so you don't lose them the g502 features an optical
sensor with awesome precise tracking and the only thing to be aware of how the
teflon feet at the bottom that on our sample were out easily and became an
annoyance with tracking and there are many other cases like this online so
there's no replacement feet included but it seems Logitech has addressed this
issue by sending out replacement feet and they also believe that extra set is
now included in all the packaging and well that would be it for our top 5
gaming mice that we have reviewed as they have gone through our deep analysis
but let us know if any other gaming mice that you would recommend to the viewers
to expand the horizon of a half a million options that we already have
available and if you're an owner of any of these mice mentioned on this list are
you happy with your current setup or considering to change for something else
well let us know in the comments below make sure to check out our full reviews
of all these mice here as always thanks for watching consider subscribing for

v-mWK_kcZMs,NileRed,Science,Making toilet paper moonshine,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-mWK_kcZMs,2 years ago,8.1M views,Science,so for this video I'm gonna be doing exactly what the title says and I'm gonna be turning toilet paper into drinkable alcohol I don't know exactly where this idea came from but about six months ago I became convinced that this conversion was possible this is because toilet paper and well pretty much all paper is made almost entirely of cellulose cellulose naturally occurs in almost all plants and we use it to make everything from cotton clothing to paper or cardboard would have always found interesting though is that at the core of it it's just a chain of simple glucose sugar molecules sugar is something that we usually associate with food but in cellulose the glucose units have been strung together in a very specific way which gives it completely different properties this is always blowing my mind because it means that our clothing and almost all paper is basically made out of sugar and wood is also about 50% cellulose so a lot of our houses are also kind of made out of sugar for the most part though cellulose is very resistant to degradation and the glucose is mostly inaccessible however the fact that some animals at microbes have developed ways to break it back down into glucose told me that there had to be a way that I could do it based on this my dream was to start with a cellulose source like toilet paper and then somehow chop it up to make a solution of glucose into that I could then throw in some Brewers ease to turn it into alcohol and then I could distill it to make some weird toilet paper moonshine the biggest challenge of this project was of course the first part which was breaking down the cellulose to do this there were two main ways either chemically or enzymatically and both of them had their own pros and cons the chemical method was more efficient but it involved using a lot of acid which would be hard to separate from the sugar after it was done I would have most likely ended up having to neutralize all the acid and it figured that this would both be wasteful and kind of messy the enzyme method on the other hand appeared to be less efficient and even take longer but from what I could tell it was a lot cleaner and much easier to set up after thinking about it for a good while I felt that I liked the enzymatic way better so the next thing that I had to do was buy some enzyme the enzyme that I need to break down the cellulose was called cellulase and the cheapest source of it that I could find was from a company called the AL chemists pantry they were a Brewing Company and was all supposed to be food grade stuff so it was almost perfect and I bought a bag of it it also clearly stated that all the sillies came from east and not bacteria and I'll explain why this was important later on but anyway the enzyme was being shipped from Europe and it was gonna take a few weeks to arrive so while it was waiting for it I figured that it was a good time to actually put together the process that I was going to be doing it honestly took me a while to figure it all out but after a bunch of research I eventually came up with something that was relatively simple to do it all he needed was some basic equipment and a few easy-to-get chemicals when the enzyme eventually arrived I considered doing some small-scale tests to verify that what I came up with worked but it was such a simple process that I decided to just wing it and go all in if it ended up working it would save me a lot of time and I figured that at worst out of a bunch of sad failure footage that could be used for something so now to get started the first thing that I needed was some toilet paper I'm pretty sure that almost any brand would have worked but I specifically went with the one with the fluffy kittens on it toilet paper is one of the least densely packed forms of paper which means that it has a lot of potential surface area for enzymes to attack it however this doesn't necessarily mean that it's easier for enzymes to break it down at the molecular level the cellulose fibers are still tightly packed together and it's hard for cellulase to do anything if I just directly mix the enzyme with the toilet paper not very much would happen and it would probably make little to no sugar to fix this problem though it wasn't very hard and I just had to pretreat the cellulose with a dilute base so I got it a large pot and into it I added three litres of distilled water followed by 60 grams of sodium hydroxide drain cleaner this would give me roughly a 2% base solution and I stirred it until everything dissolved then I slowly added one entire roll and as you would expect with toilet paper it quickly started soaking it up after about 10 seconds it was completely full of water and I tried to break it up as much as I could I also pulled out the cardboard tube from the center because I wanted to keep this purely just toilet paper I was eventually left with a nice and mushy toilet paper stew and the next thing to do was to basically cook it to do this I just put it onto a cheap Ikea induction heater and I cranked up the power it all slowly heated up and when it eventually got to a boil I turned down the power to keep it at a light simmer I tried stirring it often to prevent it from splashing but it didn't really seem to help it apparently just loves splattering boiling hot water everywhere and I found that putting on the lid was absolutely necessary the goal here was to try to keep it under control and to have it simmer for about an hour and a half under these conditions the cellulose fibers were being attacked by the base and getting partially degraded this caused a lot of the bonds between the fibers to be broken which allowed them to separate and become less densely packed it was also chopping up the cellulose fibres into smaller pieces and their average length was going down a lot this created more shorter length fibers and this was important because it meant that there were more open ends the cellulose enzyme can only degrade the fiber from the end and by making more potential areas of attack it should make it go a lot faster in summary though the major effect of this base treatment was that it was separating the fibers and chopping them up by the time it was done the whole thing had turned yellow and it had a very distinct smell to it I honestly thought that it was going to be horrible but it was surprisingly pleasant I'm not exactly sure how to describe it but it was kind of sweet and woody I took it off the heater and I let it cool for about 30 minutes and when it wasn't crazy hot anymore I filtered off all the paper what I was left with in the strainer looked a lot like some bad mashed potatoes in the container below it was all the water and without the paper it had a much darker orange brown color what I had to do now was wash it with a lot of distilled water to get rid of the base and as much of the color as possible I tried doing this a couple times directly in the strainer but it just wasn't very efficient and most of the paper barely got washed so what I did instead was clean the pot from before and dump everything back into it in here I was able to add a lot more water and I was able to thoroughly mix around the paper to make sure that it all got washed this was then poured back into the strainer and after doing it just once it was already looking pretty good I ended up doing this one more time and then I just did several crappier washes directly in the strainer when I eventually felt that it was good enough I tried squeezing out as much of the water as I could at this point though the container was quite full with water already and it was hitting the bottom of the strainer so I just continued doing it over the pot and this was what I was eventually left with this pre treated paper was now good to go but it wasn't quite ready to get things started and I still had to make the enzyme solution to do this I first had to make an enzyme concentrate by adding 90 grams of the enzyme powder that I got earlier and then bringing it up to about 400 mils using distilled water I then stirred it around but a lot of it didn't want to dissolve because most of this enzyme powder was just filler it's pretty common for enzymes to be dispersed on inert fillers and in this case the fillers were cornstarch and maltodextrin the cellulose enzyme itself and most of the malted dextran dissolved into the water but the cornstarch was pretty much insoluble I was planning this project I was a bit concerned because both cornstarch and maltodextrin are also glucose based sugars I was worried that they might also end up getting broken down into glucose and turned into ethanol but this actually isn't an issue they don't get attacked by the cellulase and the yeast and the fermentation step that we'll be doing later aren't able to break them down either I even confirmed this by doing a separate control rod but I'll talk about that later in the video because these fillers were a nerd I could have just directly used this mixture as it was but I wanted to clean it up a bit and to get rid of the cornstarch filter and cornstarch though is almost always a nightmare and instead I just covered the top and I let it sit in my fridge overnight by the next morning it had pretty much all separated and this enzyme concentrate was now good to go to make the actual enzyme solution though I had to dilute this concentrate in something known as a buffer solution a buffer solution is something that's commonly used when working with enzymes and it helps keep the pH at a specific level this is important because enzymes are very sensitive to pH and they work most efficiently in a certain range the cellulose that I had was from yeast and the optimal pH for it was 5 so that was what I had to make the buffer at there were many different chemicals that can be used to make a buffer but a very easy and common method is to use citric acid and sodium citrate both of these are common food additives and I was able to easily find them at a local store I also found a calculator for making this buffer online and all I had to do was plug in the pH that I wanted the concentration and the total volume that I was going for based on my research a total of 3 litres seemed ideal with a pH of 5 and a molarity of 0.05 after plugging this in it told me to use about 25 grams of the sodium citrate and 12.2 grams of the citric acid so into a large mason jar I added 2 point 6 litres of distilled water followed by the citric acid and the sodium citrate I stirred it around until it all dissolved and into this I poured the enzyme concentrate from before which brought it up to three litres I tried to leave as much of the cornstarch as I could in the beaker but some of it was still able to make it in now after all this the enzyme solution was finally ready and all I had to do was at the toilet paper when it was all in there I mix it around as thoroughly as I could and I loosely covered the table I then took this whole thing and I put it into an oven that was said just slightly above 50 C this was the optimal temperature that this cellulose worked at and I had to leave it in there for two days over this time the enzymes should be attacking the cellulose and slowly turning it into glucose when it comes to cellulase though it usually isn't just one enzyme doing everything and it's actually a group of a few different ones all working together the first one is endo cellulase and it breaks the bonds between the fibers and within the fibers themselves by pre-treating the paper with a base though a lot of these bonds were already broken and the ones that remained were a lot easier to access the liberated fibers were then attacked by the EXO cellulase which degrades them from their ends so what it does is bind to the end and travel along the fiber and chop off groups of 2 or 4 glucose units these much smaller sugar units are then finally broken down into glucose by another enzyme called cell o by A's when I checked on it the next day the paper had all floated to the top I then stirred it and compared to before it was definitely a lot thinner and fluffy the cellulase had clearly done something to it and so far it was looking a lot better than I expected I checked on it again about half an hour later and it had separated where most of it stayed floating the stuff at the top was slowly falling down though and over the course of the day most of it ended up at the bottom I left it until the next day until it hit the 48 hour mark and this was what I had there was still a bunch of stuff left over but it didn't at all resemble the toilet paper that I started with it was done at this point so I took it out of the oven but before moving on I had to let it cool down it was currently somewhere just above 50 C but I needed it to be closer to 35 this was gonna take about an hour though and in the meantime I poked around at it a bit I was honestly really impressed with how fine and fluffy it was and like I said before I really didn't expect it to work this well I'm really not sure exactly how much paper was still left here but a feeling was probably around 10 to 20 percent of what I started with however that's almost just entirely speculation on my part and not really based on much when it eventually got to 35 C it was time to add the yeast when it comes to fermenting sugar to make alcohol there were a lot of different yeast strains to choose from and each of them have their own pros and cons however in my case I wasn't doing anything very fancy so I just went with common brewers yeast which can tolerate many conditions these conditions though at least in terms of pH were actually kind of ideal as I mentioned earlier the cellulose that I was using originally came from yeast so the pH was already tuned to be optimal for yeast this was why I didn't want to use a bacterial cellulase because then I would have had to readjust the pH the yeast in the packet was dehydrated and right now they were all getting rehydrated and coming back to life I then snapped on the plastic adapter that the jar came with followed by the lid that I had modified I'd cut a hole in it to fit a stopper in an airlock so that it could prevent air from getting in and to also help track the progress of the fermentation initially not much appear to be happening but then very quickly a lot of yeast flakes started floating to the top they were being carried by the co2 gas that they were producing which gave them some buoyancy when they got to the top though and released the co2 they would then sink back down this cycle continued for a while but it didn't last forever because the yeast were slowly being dispersed into the water by the next day it was just a murky looking mixture and there were no pieces floating around anymore it was also generating a lot of co2 which was a very good sign because it told me that the yeast were happily eating away at sugar how much sugar was actually there though I had no idea but it was definitely working at least to some degree I then looked at the airlock and it was letting a bubble out about every 30 seconds which was a pretty decent rate what I had to do now was basically nothing and I just had to wait until it completely stopped bubbling when this eventually happens it would mean that there was little to no sugar left and I figured it would take about two weeks I didn't just leave it where it was though and I put it in the oven that I used before and I kept it just above 30 see this was about a week later and the amount of paper at the bottom had gone down quite a bit this was because I had never deactivated the cellulase and it was still slowly attacking the cellulose it wasn't as efficient because it was around 30 C instead of above 50 but it was still apparently working in terms of bubbling it was much slower than before but it was still clearly going on so I put it back in the oven and I waited another week so I came back a week later and when I checked on it the airlock wasn't moving at all and I couldn't see any bubbling going on at the bottom there was still some white stuff but it wasn't sure if this was leftover paper or just a bunch of yeast at this point I considered it done and now the next thing that I had to do was distill it to get out the ethanol I didn't want to include all that questionable stuff at the bottom though so I poured everything into another container the bit that was still there was then dumped into a coffee filter this filtration was really slow and it wasn't really worth waiting for it to finish the liquid that did eventually pass through though would all be added back to the main batch but anyway with all that done I could start setting up the distillation when most people distill alcohol they use a large and specialized setup for it which is the most efficient thing to do however I just decided to do it in glassware because my scale was relatively small and I thought that it would look nicer almost all my glassware had been used before so to keep this food safe I bought a fresh set from ebay for about fifty five dollars Canadian the biggest flask that came with though was only one liter so I'd have to distill it in multiple batches to get things started I added a stir bar and then I poured in the alcohol solution in general it's best not to go much over the halfway point but I want to get this done in the fuze batch as possible so I ended up pushing it a bit above the flask have put together the rest of the setup and to do this I used a fractional column a thermometer a condenser and a beaker I then turned on my water circulator and I got some cold water flowing through the condenser at this point it was good to go so under the flask I added a heating mantle and I turned on the heating and stirring as it warmed up it started bubbling a lot but it wasn't boiling and it was mostly just co2 gas getting kicked out of solution the colour also shifted to being much whiter and I think this was caused by yeast coming out of suspension some frothing started happening and it didn't look like it wanted to disappear and this was gonna be a problem so I turned on the heating to try to prevent a disaster but it was a bit too late the foam had already started climbing the column and it wasn't really slowing down it was able to make its way all the way to the top of the column and then suddenly it started actually boiling and it launched a bunch of liquid through the entire setup this was a bit of a pain but it wasn't the end of the world it just meant that it was gonna take a bit longer because they now had to recycle everything here in the next batch and also I had to be a bit more careful with the heating when it eventually looked like it was under control I covered the flask in the column with some aluminum foil this helps insulate them and it makes it easier for the vapor to climb the column and make it to the condenser I also swapped a beaker but the stuff coming over was still pretty murky because it was picking up all the solid junk that was carried up the column before this Ron was definitely turning out to be way messier than I expected I was hoping that this stuff would be nice and clear but that obviously wasn't the case and I was gonna have to recycle this as well it wasn't a total loss or anything though because the alcohol coming over was definitely a lot more concentrated than it started at it just didn't look very nice however it was still mostly just water and it had other volatile stuff mixed in as well to really clean it up and to properly concentrated I'd have to do a second or maybe even a third distillation the reason that the stuff coming over was mostly water was because I was only starting with a very low concentration of ethanol in my fermentation mixture it was probably at most something like 2% ethanol and that meant that it was 98% water at the very beginning the stuff coming over was probably close to 50 or 60 percent ethanol but after that it quickly and continuously dropped this happened because as the ethanol was boiled off that 2% concentration was constantly decreasing and the relative amount of water was constantly increasing this caused more and more water vapor to be let off with the ethanol and the stuff that I was receiving eventually became almost entirely water this meant that I couldn't really trust the thermometer because the temperature was heavily skewed to the boiling point of water however even though it was well above the boiling point of ethanol which is around 78 C there was still some ethanol coming over once it was up at around 98 usually temperature is the best thing to go by but because I couldn't use it here I had to go with the more traditional way so to know how close it was to being done I just occasionally tasted what was coming over and tried to tell if there was any ethanol in it as I said before though along with the water and ethanol there's other volatile stuff coming over fit which doesn't really make it taste very good it wasn't as bad as I expected it would be but I did end up spitting out most of what I tried at some point I couldn't taste any more ethanol in it and then I continued collecting it for several more minutes after this I considered it done and pretty much all of the ethanol should have been extracted everything left in the boiling flask was just waste and after letting it cool for a bit I poured it down the drain this was one of the rare times where it's okay for me to do this because unlike a lot of the chemistry that I often do there was nothing toxic or dangerous in this this was everything that I'd collected which was not very pretty to say the least and like I said before was just gonna be recycled so I reattached the now empty flask and I poured them in I then added more of the other stuff and I set it all up again this time I was super careful with the heating and there wasn't a disaster this time because it was gonna be a lot slower I expected the ethanol coming over to be more concentrated and I started with just a small vial however after a bit I realized that I was gonna be collecting a lot more than this and I swapped it out for a mason jar then just like the other run I did it until a taste test told me that there wasn't any more alcohol coming over and when it was done I emptied the flask filled it with fresh stuff and just kept it going it was all going really well all the way up to the last batch and everything that I had was nice and clear however for some reason and of course decided to go crazy right when it was close to the end and it spit over a bunch of that white junk this wasn't a huge deal though because I planned to do a second distillation anyway but it was still kind of sad this whole distillation process was way slower than I expected and it took me a few days to finish at this point though it was finally done so I took away the mason jar and I dumped out all the stuff in the flask what I had now was less than 10% of the volume that I started with so it was way more concentrated than before as a quick test mostly just for fun I decided to try lighting it on fire however it still wasn't concentrated enough to ignite and not very much happened I honestly wasn't very surprised by this though and now to actually find out its concentration I poured it all into a grad cylinder I then dropped in a hydrometer which will float at different heights depending on the density of the liquid when there's more ethanol the density will be lower and this meter will be able to sink deeper in this case though it didn't go very deep at all and it told me that the concentration was around 20% this was way higher than I ever imagined getting from this project and 250 mils of 20% alcohol really isn't bad at all I was hoping to maybe get 5 or 10 mils of pure alcohol but based on this it's telling me that there's more like 50 but anyway at this point if all I was looking for was to drink some dirty toilet paper wine I could have stopped here however based on the taste test that I had to do this wouldn't be a very pleasant experience to make it even remotely tolerable I had to distill it again to get rid of all that solid junk and to purify it besides ethanol there were a lot of other volatile and bad tasting things in there when it was super dilute it was very difficult to get rid of them but now with another distillation I should be able to get rid of almost all of them this time I had a lot less liquid so I could do it in a smaller flask and all in one batch I also completely cleaned and scrubbed the rest of the setup to make sure that it was as clean as possible I then set it up like before but this time the heating mantle was a bit oversized this was okay though and it would just make the heating a bit less efficient however with most of the yeast and most of the other stuff gone now there shouldn't be a problem with bubbling or foaming at this point I was just about to get things started but then I realised that I totally forgot the stir bar so I just quickly popped it open again and dropped one in and then I turned on the heating and stirring after this I covered everything with foil and I waited for stuff to start coming over one major difference between this distillation and the last one was that there was way less water so it could actually pay attention to the temperature the first drop showed up at around 70 C and then it slowly rose to 79 C we're remained constant this initial amount was called before shot and it contained almost entirely low boiling point side products in this section if it were present most of the methanol would come over but I don't think that there was any here this is because methanol is only produced when certain foods are fermented that contains sugars called pectins I started with nearly pure cellulose though so there was no real reason for any of it to be made as I kept collecting it at 79 CE it slowly got into the portion called the heads which was mostly ethanol but it still had some other stuff in it I kept catching it in the same vial as the for shot for a bit and then I swapped it to a beaker to get the rest as more chemo for it slowly moved to the section called the hearts which was almost pure ethanol along with the ethanol though usually comes some other things which actually taste good and it makes this portion the most valuable I was tracking everything again by occasionally tasting it and at this point it was quite pure and probably around 85% like before though there was still a lot of water in the boiling flask and the amount of ethanol that was in it was constantly decreasing so the stuff that I was collecting slowly got less concentrated and the temperature also slowly increased as this happened higher boiling points I products were being carried over with the ethanol and it was changing the taste this portion is near the end of the distillation and it's commonly known as the tails however I didn't ferment anything complex like fruit so for this section there weren't many side products that could come over to me the only thing that I noticed was that it was getting more dilute and maybe a bit bitter when making moonshine distillers usually don't collect everything in one container and they try to separate the different sections both the heads and the tails contain a lot of ethanol but they often have a bunch of weird stuff mixed in so they're often just included in future runs the hearts like I said before are the most valuable and they contain the best tasting portion knowing exactly when to start collecting the hearts and when to stop is one of the most important things when it comes to making a good quality product I of course wasn't making a typical moonshine though and I felt that my ethanol was a bit too precious to discard any of it this was why I just chose to collect everything in one beaker also like I said before I was starting with a relatively pure sugar source so there weren't that many side products that could be made when it got to around 80 mils the temperature was about 99 C and I didn't taste ethanol anymore so I considered it donnnnneee this was everything those left in the boiling flask and like all the other runs I waited for it to cool and then I got rid of it the final result of this was a team ELLs of an unknown concentration and this little vial of the four shot I'm not sure how to describe it but the four shot really didn't smell very good and I just threw it away now for the good part I wanted to know how concentrated it was instead of just doing it with a hydrometer though I again tried lighting it on fire this time it ignited really easily and it burned with that blue flame that's typical of ethanol I was really happy that this worked but it didn't really tell me much of anything about what the concentration actually was to get an accurate number again I just had to use a hydrometer the volume here was really low though and my current setup couldn't do it so I had to buy a smaller one however at first this one also looked like it was still too big when I looked at the bottom of it much closer though I saw that it was actually floating so the reading on here should be fine and it told me that it was about 64% this was more or less what I was expecting to get and I felt that 64% was decent for a moonshine and I didn't have to distill it again so at this point it was pretty much done and I poured it all into a little jar and I labeled it appropriately at 64% and about 78 mils this was equivalent to 50 mils of pure ethanol and like I said before it was way more than I ever expected I started with a hundred grams of toilet paper and assuming that a hundred percent of that mass was turned into glucose the maximum yield was about 60 mils this meant that this whole process was 83% efficient which to me was suspiciously good this got me worried that may be the multi dextran or the cornstarch that was added along with the enzyme was breaking down as well theoretically cellulous doesn't attack either of these sugars and yeast can't ferment them but I had to make sure so I ran a control by repeating the exact same process and I just didn't include any toilet paper when I distilled it all I did actually get some ethanol and my final yield was 20 mils of 20% this meant that there were five mils of pure ethanol and this likely came from the moth or dextran which can sometimes have a small amount of fermentable sugar in it so it was contributing some ethanol but pretty much all of it was still from the toilet paper if five mils were coming from the enzyme though than my real yield was 45 mils and not 50 and my actual efficiency was about 75% in my opinion this was still shockingly good and even though I did everything myself it's still kind of hard to believe that it all came from toilet paper but anyway now that I had actually made it the only thing left to do was to see how it tasted while I was distilling it I individually tasted each section but now that it was all combined into one I was really curious to know what it was like okay so to get started I'm just gonna smell it and I mean there's nothing gross about it but also nothing really very special it kind of smells like vodka except with a bit of extra maybe not good other stuff in there which again as I mentioned before probably comes from either the heads or the tails but it's not bad overall and I guess I'll just taste it now I mean it's really sure because it's 64% but doesn't taste very bad it's a little bit bitter which I kind of got when I was tasting the tails when I was making it other maddest I don't know I'm honestly not the best person to really review it because I don't drink alcohol often and I honestly don't really like the taste of alcohol but compared to vodkas and other stuff I've had in the past this wasn't that much worse there was again that a little bit of a bitter taste and maybe some off taste that came from the heads but besides that I mean it wasn't too bad if I were just served it I would think that it's just generic alcohol which I hate anyway I'm not gonna add that part but anyway this about brings me to the end of this project when I first came up with the idea for this it was mostly just a funny concept and I had no idea that it was actually gonna work this well I was honestly hoping for maybe 5 mils and it's probably the first time ever that a project has turned out this much better than I expected also even though I'm really not a fan of alcohol the flavor wasn't bad and overall I'm still shocked at how well it all turned out for all the alcohol that I still have left over I would have loved to do a giveaway but I doubt that it would be legal so I'm just gonna be keeping it as a souvenir and maybe I'll try to use it in a future video it took me a lot longer than I expected to put this all together so my video schedule is a bit weird now but I do plan to get another one out around mid-december I don't want to give any details of what its gonna be about but this next one is also a funny concept that I'd been working on for a while it's also kind of food based too so there'll be some more tasting going on before I go though I want to quickly mention team trees which I'm sure a lot of you guys have already heard about at this point for those that haven't though it's a tree planting initiative that was started by mr. beast and Mark Rober it's a massive YouTube collaboration and every dollar that's donated will plant one tree somewhere around the world and the goal is to get to 20 million at the time of editing this they're less than 5 million away and if you want to help you can do this by either donating or picking up some of their merch and just as one last thing I don't mention my other social media here very often but I am also on Twitter and Instagram on both of these I often post content that never makes it to youtube and sometimes I also share some high-quality stuff like this as usual a big things goes out to all my supporters on patreon everyone who supports me can see my videos at least 24 hours before I post them to YouTube also everyone on patreon can directly message me and if you support me with $5 or more you'll get your name at the end like you see here [Music],36:57

of myself wolfy to say it isn't true say it is it true you cheated on your girlfriend with potentially a 15 year old or a 16 year old and the reason why I say 15 is because the original caption of all

K8O3bpR4mdQ,Epicurious,Food,4 Levels of Brownies: Amateur to Food Scientist | Epicurious,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8O3bpR4mdQ,3 years ago,10M views,Food,[Music] hi i'm aydah i'm a level one chef i'm anthony and i'm a level two chef i think i need like a child size i'm elisa i've been a professional pastry chef for over 20 years [Music] my brownies are a little bit cakey they're just right i like my brownies halfway between cakey and fudgy i probably make this recipe once or twice a month i like a fudgy brownie this brownie recipe i learned back in pastry school and i've been perfecting it ever since [Music] i'm gonna start making brownies i am gonna start with my dry ingredients half a cup of flour just regular all-purpose flour i always weigh my ingredients that way you can always make sure every recipe is consistent every time you make it i just put too much flour in and then a cup of sugar i'm using granulated sugar so i use a regular granulated white sugar and also a dark brown sugar because that will give an extra rich flavor to my brownies i use melted butter because it's already in liquid form we're going to add room temperature butter it's just much easier to incorporate if it's room temperature when i choose my butter i want to make sure that there are no additives in it i'm using a pure butter and organic is always the best and i'm just using my fork to mix see just think of how many calories you're burning right now when you're doing this and then you can eat all of this yourself and it evens itself out creaming together the butter and sugar helps get that cakiness going you're done creaming when it's nice and well mixed together but the butter is also fluffy and kind of sticky while my sugars are incorporating i cracked my eggs into a bowl it's really important that you crack your eggs into a bowl first not directly into your mixture because you never know if little pieces of shell will get inside [Music] that wouldn't be good one nice little touch i like to add is a little bit of almond flavor to my brownies so we're gonna use an ounce of amaretto liqueur now i'm going to add the 3 4 cocoa powder use the best cocoa powder you can find this smells so good i don't pack it or fluff it or anything else i just scoop it in and then level it off i prefer to use chocolate rather than cocoa powder cocoa powder sometimes can leave a granular taste i'm just going to melt some delicious chocolate and high quality butter over a bain maree i want to make almost like a chocolate syrup this will give a really nice texture to my brownie love makes the ideal brownie but also a good mixture if you look at the consistency it's nice and smooth now we're going to mix these together i'm using a hand mixer because i don't want to sit here for 30 minutes and work up a nice sweat i'm using a paddle attachment rather than a whisk because i don't want to whisk in any extra air you have to do it like this like your life depends on it all right very chocolaty one of the best combinations are brownies and caramel so i've decided to make bourbon salted caramel i'm just starting with sugar right into the pan i'm at about 160 degrees and it's turning a nice amber color and i'm going to add butter some heavy cream i add the bourbon right into the mixture the bourbon adds a nice complex flavor and some notes of nuttiness to the caramel i'm going to stick it into the freezer for at least an hour but i have one last step homemade whipped cream is one of the easiest things you can make it has three ingredients heavy cream confectioners sugar and vanilla extract and you whip it in a chilled bowl i know it looks curdled but it's not all right this is some assembly required before we put the batter in i'm going to grease the pan i like to treat my butter like a crayon sometimes i'm just going to make sure that every little nook and cranny is covered by that butter i'm putting it into a pan lined with parchment that's been buttered so it won't stick also going to add just a pinch of flour to coat the butter and then we're going to roll it around i think this just helps everything come out at the end like so that nothing sticks to the sides i'm going to put half of the batter into the pan first i'm just gonna make it even sometimes you'll see people have baked their brownies and it's really uneven and that's usually because they don't use an offset spatula to smooth it out and put the batter in all areas of the pan this is my other little special trick and treat i like to put the chocolate chips right in the middle of the brownie maybe two handfuls yeah maybe a little bit more you get a chip and you get a chip they melt down and that's where you get a little bit more of that fudginess finish it up with the last half i'm going to layer the caramel right on top and i'll show you a special trick so now i'm just using my butter knife and i'm swirling the caramel into the brownie batter i mean if there's a little leftover on the spoon that's not a bad thing now i'm going to bake this for 20 to 25 minutes at 325 degrees 350 degrees for 20 minutes 45 minutes at 350 degrees all right looks good it looks good i'm excited about this they look and smell delicious when can we dig in it's alive i am the queen of brownies i just stand this is this is we're gonna top it with sliced almonds i like a lot of moments and some confectioner's sugar it's more for looks than anything else it's not coming off [Music] bon appetit very very excited with what i've done here i mean that messing with the back you have cakey layers on the bottom and the top you got that nice fudginess in the middle when those chocolate chips all melted down it's awesome you can smell the combination of the caramel with the chocolate and the fresh whipped cream all right let's cut off a bite and try it this is a good brownie i mean wow nice work that's amazing me now that we've seen levels one two and three it's clear that there's a lot of variability when it comes to brownies let's talk about what makes each one unique let's talk about chocolate the form of chocolate that you use is gonna make a difference as to whether you end up with a chewy brownie or a more fudgy brownie i like my brownies really fudgy my brownies are a little bit cakey for a chewy brownie you're gonna go with cocoa powder cocoa powder is processed from the roasted cocoa beans after the cocoa butter has been removed it's pressed into disks and then it's pulverized and you end up with cocoa powder most cocoa powders go through a dutch processing where we add an alkali and that raises the ph so it's less acidic as you raise the ph some of the compounds in the chocolate form pigments that don't have a lot of taste to it so you get a really dark rich color with a more mild flavor you might think of an oreo cookie it's almost black in color it's highly alkalized and it has a really mild soft chocolate flavor if you want a fudgy brownie you use melted dark chocolate like elisa did that has all of the cocoa butter it's going to give you a nice silky dense brownie it's already in liquid form so you don't need to incorporate as much air when you're mixing this will make a really nice fudgy texture unlike cocoa powder which is going to need mixing and hydration in order to work in your brownie it takes a lot of arm work anthony did a combination of the two he used cocoa powder but then he added a layer of chocolate chips in between the batter so he had this middle section that was pretty fudgy kind of an unexpected treat while you're biting into it the flavor profile of these brownies ranged from simple to complex adis was a really simple flavor profile nothing but chocolate it's a brownie it's gonna be eaten anthony did something different he added an almond liqueur i think it just kind of kicks it up a notch which is a really nice complementary flavor to the chocolate he also added almonds on top which really bolstered that almond flavor and added a nice textural component i might have the whole thing just for myself elisa topped her brownies with a bourbon infused caramel similar to the almonds the bourbon adds a nutty flavor and it also has some notes of butterscotch which emphasizes the caramel it's going to be fantastic caramelization is a really interesting and complex non-enzymatic reaction of sucrose which is white sugar breaking down into its component of fructose and glucose which is very very sweet white sugar by itself has just a sweet note as you increase the temperature you lose water and you increase the browning compounds that are expressed in the caramel i'm at about 160 degrees and it's turning a nice amber color and you get these really complex beautiful roasted toasty flavors oh i want to have some more you can make caramel with just white sugar and heat but when you add the heavy cream and the butter it controls crystallization you don't want any granularity or crystallization in your caramel you want it to be smooth and silky no one wants a clumpy brownie when baking the brownies ada used a glass dish while anthony and elisa used metal metal is a good conductor of heat it heats very fast and you'll get a nice crispy edge to your brownies anthony greased and floured his pan this is different than aydah who just greased her pan i don't know what's going on when you add flour to the pan the flour acts like a nuclei where the batter can kind of grab onto the flour and creep up the edges of the dish this results in a thicker brownie on the sides i'm kind of an edge guy myself perfect i am the queen of brownies does it look so pretty smells delicious there's a lot that goes into baking brownies so next time you make them i hope you consider all of these things so you get the perfect brownie for you see you later [Music],10:51
wNo7qoLRtkQ,Linus Tech Tips,Tech,How bad is this $5000 PC from 10 years ago?,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNo7qoLRtkQ,2 years ago,8.5M views,Tech,"thanks to Overlord from our forum I have got my hands on a really unique piece of computing history here this is the Intel extreme series D 5400 XS a six hundred and fifty dollar motherboard that didn't work without two $1500 CPUs and anywhere from two hundred and fifty to five hundred dollars worth of special memories not 100% sure what the pricing was like information going back that far as a little scarce because all that pricing that I just fed you guys is based on information that I could find from 2008 yes my friends this right here was the heart of a system that once you account for graphics cards power supplies case drives cooling could easily cost you five to seven thousand dollars for a finished Tower right up there with the most expensive enthusiast systems today now at the time one of the main criticisms of the game for a platformer was its high price to performance ratio especially because at the time well it was hard to find applications that scaled beyond two cores but how has it aged there's only one way for us to find out by sitting through this segue to our sponsor glass wire with glass wire you can see what's going in and out of your PC when you're connected to the internet so use glass wire to see if there are any suspicious apps that are behaving badly on your PC offer code linus gets you 25% off at the link below [Music] this thing is an absolutely incredible condition like even all the original documentation and accessories and stuff are in here here's a copy of Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter - if you're into that it's even got the door hanger fraggers only noobs be where you'll be pwned motherfrakkers put that on my door now the first thing that jumps out about the board itself is of course its massive size so ea TX motherboards like this we're extremely uncommon outside of the server space at that time but it's not like it wasn't this big for good reason it was absolutely packed with cutting-edge features for that era so it uses the LGA 771 socket or rather I should say two of them which supports Zeon's but also the unlocked and overclockable extreme edition QX ninety 775 now the xeon platform was chosen for one main reason the consumer chips had a different pin out that didn't support multiple sockets and the goal here was to create an eight core platform several years before AMD would release their first consumer eight core cpu and six years before intel would release its own so then what we're dealing with here is two event Elle's 3.2 gigahertz York field Extreme Edition CPUs connected over a 1600 megahertz frontside bus to a 5000 series chipset which we can find right in the middle here that right there provides our CPUs with all the connectivity that they need to memory expansion slots and all of your rear i/o and all that good stuff now one of the funny things about this system is how normal it looks like here's your SATA ports where your hard drives go here's your PCI Express slots where your graphics card goes there's nothing about it to really immediately indicate that it is a eleven years old unless you start to look a little bit closer let's talk about the memory these are really special so they use commodity ddr2 DRAM chips but they're actually not inter compatible with ddr2 these are called fully buffered dims or FB dims so one of the big challenges of pushing memory speeds and capacities up is the complexity of designing the traces between the memory and the controller so in this case that's on the Northbridge but in a modern system that memory controller would be on the CPU itself now one of the ways to reduce trace complexity and reduce load on a memory controller is to move to a serial bus rather than a parallel one so in simple terms they decided that instead of having the controller communicate directly with the memory chips on the module they put a chip called an advanced memory buffer onto every module that would act as a go-between buffering all the read and write requests now this extra chip here is not to be confused with the extra DRAM chip on ECC memory that's used in modern workstations and servers for error correction now the amb came with a penalty to both write speed and to latency because of the additional communication step but at the time Intel thought that this trade-off would end up being worth it for the future improvements in capacity that never actually materialized by the next generation Intel ended up following AMD lead moving the memory controller on to the CPU and they ended up setting the stage for the ultimately successful plan to increase memory slot counts which was adding more memory channels to the CPU itself ok so one of my challenges getting this thing up and running was actually finding some coolers that had mounting hardware for such an old socket fortunately I happened to cross a couple of these old Yemen twos these things are kind of jokes to mount ah I didn't really have a choice they were the only non water-cooling things that we're still compatible in our warehouse and I didn't feel like reading water cooling up to it this time there is just something about a dual socket system that just gets my inner geek going you know before we booted up there's a couple more things I want to appreciate one is the onboard power and reset switches that was pretty cutting-edge for the time even if the i/o hasn't aged so well USB to firewire and eSATA I guess one for three ain't bad for standards that we're going to still exist ten years later and this is really unique so you've got your four PCI Express 16x slots here but at the time no chipset could actually directly run four PCI Express 16x slots so how did they do it so check this out Intel's Southbridge needed some kind of a solution to increase the number of PCI Express slots and what they used was actually two Nvidia PCI Express switches which would each take 16 lanes and split them out into two slots with 16 lanes each so what this meant was from Nvidia's drivers perspective all of the GPUs in the system were actually connected to an Nvidia chipset meaning that Intel didn't have to resolve the licensing dispute in order to support SLI on this particular motherboard even if none of their others could do it no some of these holes line up good enough power connectivity is almost identical to a modern board we're just gonna run a regular old SATA SSD off its compatibility and then uh theoretically I can just throw my tight necks testbench card on here and it should just fire up and a 1/2 [Music] good luck everybody now we're up hey hard drives detected Arab Nessus t rather excuse me old habits die hard so that was painless just fire it up a drive I already had set up and bippity Boppity no no drivers required or anything that's it modern Windows 10 now this is cool one fun thing about this generation of hardware is that because the CPU bones connected to the Northbridge bone is connected to the memory bone we don't have to deal with the performance penalty where modern dual socket systems can experience worse performance when this cpu needs something from the memory that's directly attached to this one causing an extra communication hop so you can actually see here all of our cores show up as a single Numa node which should allow basically any workload to scale well across all eight of our course I mean except for the fact that we have a North Bridge so there's just like always an extra-hot I mean with that said overall system responsiveness here is super usable like with an SSD drive in here I would have no reason to think unless I opened up Task Manager that I'm looking at a super old computer here like everything just kind of works so while it's definitely not modern there are some really good things about this setup like this is about as far back as you can go while still maintaining most of the modern creature comforts like PCI Express even Gen one means that we can add high-speed connectivity to this system you want 10 gig networking which I just installed boom and adding card and you're ready to go you want USB 3 boom another adding card you're ready to go like PCI the older generation which by the way it does also have a couple PCI slots in there tapped out at 133 megabytes a second and that was a shared bus so multiple cards plugged into multiple slots all had to share that limit PCI Express even the first generation version featured here could handle up to four gigabytes per second on a slot like this one okay so it occurs to me that we're gonna be limited by our SATA one drive but I'm copying a file over the network here and we are out of disk space one moment please at any rate we should still be able to tell if we're getting an actual 10 gig connection to our server here it should exceed 112 megabytes the second ad boat there it is a hundred and eighty three megabytes a second which is well shy of 10 gig but certainly more than one it's our CPU usage look like doing that mmm so let's come up with some more realistic workloads then I mean what about 4k YouTube remember guys this is 2000 holy this was in 2008 yep remember when YouTube looked like this 4k YouTube was just a twinkle and the engineers eye when this system was released so let's see if it can handle it there it is ladies and gentlemen 4k YouTube playback butter smooth what does that cost us in terms of CPU usage though actually that's not even that bad we're sitting at around 20% CPU now I'm not saying to get too excited about this because 20% CPU on this system is a boat oh it just speak to 300 watts but about 250 Watts from the wall which considering that a modern smartphone can also playback 4k YouTube in the single-digit watts is well shows you that we've definitely come a long way in the last 10 years as for multitasking well even just trying to browse the web in the foreground while our 4k video plays in the background we're gonna see spikes in CPU activity up in the range of 60 to set or even 80% depending on how heavy the pages were trying to load are so you can actually see each page load here as it's coming in oh wow loading a big Google sheet actually got us up to 75% CPU usage but our video is still playing back smoothly we can scrub around like all the features work exactly like you would expect them to now to see how well it's aged in terms of productivity let's fire up Photoshop Creative Cloud Edie you want to try and do something on this let me know let me know if it's any good all righty here's some coil line let's work in there is that a reasonable amount of time to open this yeah maybe close task manager in the background oh wow we're at a hundred percent CPU what are you trying to do there Wow you can actually hear the fans ramp up oh wow now I kind of wonder if a big part of our problem could be that we've only got eight gigs of memory oh so we're only letting Photoshop have up to five yeah point something gigs that's not the worst thing ever actually it's not great I mean your workstation doesn't perform like this does it no but this is ten years old yeah this looks pretty unusable to me I mean resolutions have gone up since then so it's just loading loading things for days all right thanks ed are we even gonna be able to close Photoshop now I was kind of hoping that the Photoshop test would go okay so that there would be some suspense when I fire up Adobe Premiere but all signs point to this just being a blood let blood bath a blood blast it's much worse give it a second it's just it's popping in it's popping in poppin fresh you know got that fresh content [Music] all right that's it all media loaded let's see what kind of performance we can get here woof now in fairness this is a que footage and we're trying to play it at half res quarter res oh no that's ugly let's try one eight okay maybe one sixteenth okay so it's not completely unusable but only at one sixteenth quality you can see now at least my scrubbing performance is quite a bit better than it was I can move around on the timeline and actually get a preview in a reasonable amount of time here so this is grayed out but that game definitely launched this is a strange behavior oh yeah we're trying a game now theoretically the higher resolution you go the more likely you are to be bottlenecked by your graphics card rather than your CPU so I'm gonna try and run a no 1800 at 4k resolution now the menus at 60fps that's not a bad sign shut up David there we go and know that spectacular menu performance did not translate to in-game so this card should be good for 45 to 50 frames per second at these settings somewhere in that range this is clearly not that now what's kind of cool is you can really see decent connection when you zoom in and you manage to get like a decent framerate so we're up to around 30 but it doesn't manage to account for like panning and also the game just crashed decent cannot help you with that wow this is one spectacular game crash like I can't even get task manager up sign out I'll do it see this is the thing that kills me about Windows they can't code an actual no and the task but if you sign out oh yeah you want to end the task no problem okay so in fairness to our system here I did choose an Oh No that it's a particularly CPU heavy game so why don't we try something a little bit more fair this here eventually is going to be rocket League again bork a high quality with motion blur off and actually this is quite playable I mean I still suck at this game or whatever but the good news is that we're running it anywhere from about 50 to 65 frames per second it actually plays pretty smart nice especially again like I said with g-sync a feature that they couldn't possibly have imagined existing back when they were creating this motherboard and CPU combo the thing is guys my secret plan all along was actually to outfit this thing with $2,500 worth of modern gaming horsepower that's right I wanted to run to RTX 28 et eyes on it in SLI now thing is though it's gonna take some time to get SLI working because there are actually issues with windows tens driver support for those Nvidia PCI Express bridges that we need oh crap I just realized I forgot to plug the chips that fan back in that's hot alright so anyway that's gonna take some work also some of the things we've tried so far have been pretty slow we're running into obvious cpu bottlenecks maybe overclocking is the solution well that's gonna take some time as well another thing 8 gigs of ram is obviously a problem for productivity but it may even be a problem for gaming for us at this point intel only ever validated this motherboard for 8 gigs of ram 4x2 gigs so I'm just gonna have to source some 4 gig fully buffered dims and just see what happens also I think there's some software optimization that we can do so game launchers it's gotten to the point where you need two three four maybe even more of those running on your system and on a modern system something like the you play launcher is a negligee amount of system overhead not enough to affect performance unless you're running Lake comparative benchmarks or something but on a system like this having you play in the background look at this just launching it spiked us up to 80 percent and having it running in the background sucks up as much as eight to ten percent of our cpu performance so to put that in context that is about two-thirds of one of my eight cores like an O still wasn't gonna run well on this thing but having stuff going in the background certainly isn't gonna help so then I want to hear from you guys what are your suggestions in the video comments for what you want to see for part two and I also want to hear from you guys what you think of this segue to my responses the NuForce be alive twos are lightweight they're bluetooth and they've got magnets on each year but to clasp them together they feature ten hours of continuous listening they fully charge in one and a half hours their IP x5 water-resistant rated so you can sweat with them in and they've got an inline microphone their Google assistant and Siri compatible and they've got a remote to skip tracks and adjust the volume you can get yours today on Amazon for just 29 bucks at the link in the video description so thanks for watching guys if you

OYCvbBijvQM,carwow,Automobile,"AMG GT C vs Audi R8 vs McLaren 570S vs BMW i8 - Roadsters ROOF, DRAG and ROLLING RACE!",0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYCvbBijvQM,3 years ago,14M views,Automobile,I'm in a mclaren 570s spider next to me is an Audi r8 v10 spyder next to that is a Mercedes AMG GT C roadster next to that is a BMW i8 roadster we can have a drag race my particular car has a 3.8 liter twin-turbo v8 with 570 horsepower that BMW has just a 1.5 liter 3-cylinder turbo engine from a mini but it also has an electric motor so it has 375 horsepower but it's also got all-wheel-drive now I've got some special guest presenters in the other two cars and in the Audi I have Yanni from Yanni mais 540 brake horsepower 5.2 v10 and it looks nice in the Mercedes we've got rapper professor green it's got a fully v8 twin-turbo and 560 brake horsepower and it looks lovely now I think Yanni might be at a bit of an advantage because he's got Quattro all-wheel drive I'm sure Yanni is very happy about it that is I'm ecstatic now before we race make sure you subscribe to this channel and click the bell icon to turn your notifications on so you updated when we make a new upload also check us out on Instagram at carlão cars for some behind-the-scenes content let's do this I'm quite excited oh my dear actually guys we are in a bunch of roadsters we should not be racing them with the roofs up you have to first put your lives down before you can go are you serious so I felt confident now I've got to put this roof down here think like a week now he's gonna be the same for all of us I actually think that the Mercedes has a slow roof I mean you're right with that Prof green well yeah but you're a disadvantage well there's only one way to find out where is the button okay okay let's go roof down come on roof I'm cheering on the roof let's mark marbles God dang roof go roof go roof come on come on come on come on horn oh my god the tumbling would come off yet not all right is slower I think yeah he was right mine's pretty quick the Mercedes is actually the quickest oh come on you're kidding me right [Music] haha honey is beta decay [Music] unbelievable it looks like you've got the slowest roof yeni you don't say hello hello and you know what I cocked up a bit because I think might have gone up and I was still something so I was busy looking at yours laughing I reckon there's a slim challenge can we do a proper drag race please where the roof can even stay up we'll stay down so I don't have to do the roof oh there you are turned round I can see you know and I went instead that had the snow roof I think I might have got that completely wrong how'd you feel about that one yeah knee Wow listen I knew I had a slow roof let's see how good you are then let's do a proper race are they gonna get dropped oh we got a better start than me come on come on come on come on come on bye-bye so quaint look than that [Music] you got really good there but funny your face when I came past him your face my reaction time was on the money and the McLaren just comes past me like I'm parked hey I wouldn't mind but my reaction time was brilliant my foot was off the brake and the wheels were the car wasn't yeah that can happen in that car you've seen me drive Matt still have an urge you rap Touche so then what exactly happened for the McLaren it did the quorum are in 11 seconds dead the only took 11.5 despite its start in the head in third was the AMG 12.4 was it standing quarter time and with thirteen point three seconds the BMW it was last across the line yeah I think your job is safe professor green now we're gonna have a rolling race from 30 miles an hour in second gear I'm gonna count us in then we're gonna for the throttles and go roll locked in manual mode Wow go see ya [Music] well that was that was interesting you were chomping at the bit there Yanni I must say you were easing forward a little bit listen my car slow I broke I started breaking because I couldn't hear anyone shout breaks I don't know if you've got a head i feet you pulled ahead of me when I started breaking I think you hadn't started breaking that point I think I'm gonna claim that you hadn't I'm 100 percent shorn or even 99 ok I reckon so so one winter the Mercedes won to the McLaren and despite numerous attempts not a single head for the Audi enforcing nor the BMW i3 which have almost pretty much forgotten about it's not even an i3 it's an i8 right guys I really really hoped you enjoyed that video now make sure you subscribe to this

giNAjqgCAaA,CDawgVA,Blog,I Paid Voice Actors To Dub JoJo Scene's With No Context,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giNAjqgCAaA,2 years ago,5.5M views,Blog,"(Licking noises)I I have an idea but if you remember from one of the previous Fiverr videos What I did was that I ordered voice actors to voice act Jojo scenes, and it was amazing If you haven't watched that video highly recommend it not because I won't adsense but because you should now if you're unfamiliar with JoJo's Bizarre Adventure it is as the name suggests a bizarre adventure it is also a bizarre adventure of weird scenes that are glorious and I love and if you haven't seen it and you want to Watch it. Don't worry. This doesn't spoil anything major so if you at all see know Jojo meme you've probably seen some of these scenes as we did in a previous video this whole Video is going to be me buying voice actors on Fiverr to voice act the most bizarre Scenes from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure and if you know anything about JoJo's it's gonna be a pretty bizarre. So here's the deal So I've wrote out the scripts for fall scenes and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure and I'm gonna split them up and send them off to voice Actors, so we're on Fiverr and we're gonna just type in anime voice Oh It's not that long anime voice actor and hopefully we're gonna find some people so for some of them I'm gonna send on the script with Contacts and links to the scenes and some of them I'm gonna send them nothing I'd be really mean and see what they come up with based on half a script and no direction It's probably to be awful and that's fair but I want to laugh first scene Jojo versus do in Egypt sure you guys have seen the oh you're approaching me mean that's Well, what if we can find a British male or a gang you can do a decent British accent. I will be your high quality male talent This guy looks very high quality. I will record epic anime voice lines We found audio we can do British you can do British It's the perfect voice actor and only for pound 20 and we have our dear. Hopefully he deliver now He'd be find out Joe true. I think this guy is fantastic. He said he could do a protagonist voice So I feel he's problem the perfect fit comer. Oh my god. Holy Beth is going so much this guy I don't know what he said Boom another voice actor we have our otro right that's seen one done knowing my luck Someone's probably not gonna do it and I'm probably gonna have to panic record another voice actor Alright scene 2 is the 7 it's the fighting noise that do and giorno make and in part 5 there are seven whole pages of the manga where giorno is just Wailing on someone and in the anime. Oh, it was beautiful. So You get the idea it's pretty intense so let's find some voice actors who can pull it off AAAAHHH! Their voice like we just got back to me. I cannot believe what this Thank you for your purchase. Just making sure you want to to voice act a man's voice British accent with stereotypical gay Enunciation correct this month being so British sound gay. Yes anime girl Voice dude, she recalls on audacity in stereo. A lot of other reason I joke is cuz there's no reason to record audio in Stereo every single XLR microphone records in mono as well. We're ordering this now. Yes was this goes on with Confirming pink I kind of want to get more people to do that Order another voice actor for the seven-page movement. Let's not get carried away plenty more scripts go around Do you have the the cherry licking scene? No doubt some of you've already seen this gift floating around we're going in our So I want to see what some voice actors could do it hell yeah, I want a cute anime girl voice do my mother I should want to mail to try the 7 page mood as well. I will voice anything that you want I have a willingness to lend my voice to whatever you want what an angry guy threatening song with the promise of a slow and Painful death. I've got you covered. He's actually describing the 7 page movie. We have to order this gentlemen Let's get Adam a boyfriend in on this action. The final scene that I have is Joseph looking through a keyhole You might have seen this gif it's one we goes It's very short scene shouldn't be difficult. Hey, thanks for checking me out Boys for your project Videos that's pretty fun videos sign me up that up. So I guess without further ado. We just wait Hope this all goes well knowing my luck This is this is gonna pick up somehow and I'm gonna have to re-record some things or I'm gonna have to go and order more Things off camera, don't worry the results I hope will be worth the wait and let's cut to the Future now and we are back It has been nine beautiful days and we're back and I'm happy to say that some things went wrong We had two people cancel, which is pretty normal. So I went and quickly ordered two more people who did their lines So now we have many clips to go through. I've only seen one of these clips the rest I had mood an edit informal as I don't want to spoil any of the surprises for me I want to go into this and then enjoy these clips in all their beauty so we have four people who have done the seven page muder and I think it's only fair that we rank them all as our Favourite to the worst without further ado. Let's begin Re I want to say thank you.

FcX0pkXSKl4,Austin Evans,Tech,Building the Ultimate Xbox 360,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcX0pkXSKl4,3 years ago,5.1M views,Tech,"- Hey guys, this is Austin. And today, it's time to finally build what you guys have been asking for months. This is the ultimate Xbox 360. So, of course, to start with, we have our pristine, brand new, in box Xbox 360, 4GB with Kinect. I mean, the last part was true. When it comes to building
the ultimate console, one of the most important things is to find something that is compatible with the most accessories. And even though you can get some stuff with the original Xbox 360,
as well as the Super Slim this is defintely going
to be our best bet. Oh boy, what a wonderful packing job. Okay, well, the first
thing we're gonna find here is actually one of the
weirdest Xbox 360 accessories, the original Kinect. Man, this is disgustingly dirty. Can you see the level
of scratches on this? Does that come up on camera? It looks like someone's, like, rubbed this thing down with sandpaper. But hey, at least we
got it for a smooth $20. Thanks Ken. Obviously, this is the way
you've gotta play your Xbox. Ugh! Why is it so dirty? Dude, there's like... I
can literally see dust, like, collected inside the fan here. Could've found us a cleaner Xbox. (sprayer noise) Okay, so now that we have
a slightly cleaner Xbox, the first accessory has to be Kinect. Now this is a really weird one. Not only was this by far the biggest accessory
available for the 360, but in some ways it was
a pretty big success but in a lot of ways, it
was kind of a failure. So it came out in 2010, several years after the Xbox 360 came
out, and the idea here is that with the series
of cameras and sensors it would basically turn
you into the controller. There was this famous demo at E3 before this was announced
back in what was called project Natal, where they
had this kid skateboarding in his room using nothing but his body as the controller, and it
looked super, super awesome. Of course, as with nearly
all of these demos, it wasn't quite as good
as it sort of seemed once you actually got your hands on it. Thus, this was picked up for $20 in a bargain bin somewhere. But, before we get to
that we have to finish upgrading our Xbox 360,
and the first thing we're going to do is put
in a bigger hard drive. So back in these days, Microsoft
sold internal hard drives that you could install yourself because for some wonderful reason, this Xbox 360 was shipping
with only 4GB of capacity. Mostly so they could actually
bundle Kinect in the box. Which as you can imagine, for a more modern console, not
exactly a lot of storage. So if you flip over the 360, there's a little panel here where
you can drop in a hard drive. So this guy is going to give us 500GB capacity, although, as always, we're gonna go above that. But, it's an easy way of getting a lot more storage in what is
really a very difficult Xbox to use if you don't have at least some kind of SSD or HDD or USB... yeah, that's all the things, right? HDD, USB, SSD. So something interesting is, is that even though the Xbox One doesn't allow you to install an internal hard drive the 360 always did. So you remember the original fat Xbox 360 actually had the top-mounted hard drives, which were really easy to pop on and off, but with the slim they
moved to the sort of cartridge design which
realistically is just a two and a half inch
laptop drive that you just slide in something like... that. And because of course
we're trying to build the ultimate Xbox 360,
near 5MB of capacity is definitely not going to be enough, which is where the Seagate
game drive comes in. So this is a 500GB SSD. Now this is typically
meant for the Xbox One as it does have a USB
3.0, and it's actually going to be faster than
the internal drive. However, this is before USB 3.0. So instead, we're hooking
up a 500GB USB 2.0 SSD. So that'll be fast. The Xbox 360 was the last
of the major consoles to stick with only dual layer DVD support, and that was fine for stuff like the PS2, but when it came to the 360,
while most games were able to fit on a single DVD
quite a few actually did need to ship on multiple discs. However, unlike the PS3
which had Blu-ray support, that was nowhere to be
found on the 360 and thus, this wonderful ridiculous
accessory was born. The Xbox HD DVD player. So for those of you who are not familiar with the HD DVD format,
this was essentially the competitor to Blu-ray back in the day. Thus the HD DVD name. Pretty clever, I know. Are you serious? It looks like a mini, fat, Xbox360! Oh, I never realized that. I've never actually seen
one of these in person. Yo, I mean, it doesn't
match with this at all, but that is so cool! Now it's time to connect this. So we've got our power
adapter, we've also got our second part of the power adapter, and then it connects via mini USB. This whole thing feels
straight out of 2006. So when it first came
out, the HD DVD add-on was a pretty impressive $200. Which still actually
probably would have been cheaper than a lot of the HD DVD players at the time, but of course
it went absolutely nowhere and thus we have Blu-ray
and I have a really ridiculous player that...
we have a game for. Oh sorry, no, actually they
didn't make games for it. Right, so this is only
for movies, I forgot. Do we have a movie for it? March of the Penguins. Okay, so this is one of the very few HD DVDs that existed. So, one of the only real issues with the Xbox 360 and the
Xbox One of today still, is that they run on AA batteries. Although thankfully, we
have a way around that too. This is the Nyko Charge Base S. So in addition to giving you
two rechargeable batteries in the box, it's also
going to be a little dock we can actually charge
our controllers with. It just feels so weird to be opening up all these old accessories that have clearly been sitting around some, like, Amazon back room for like five years. But, it's okay, they're
gonna have a better life now. So, I don't think.. that's not gonna fit. Whatever, this one will fit. So, you can see what this is supposed to look like if you don't have your giant Chatpad on. Now, with all these accessories connected to our Xbox 360, one might worry that it might get a
little bit warm, perhaps, get a little bit of a red
ring of death perhaps, even though this is a
slim and doesn't actually, physically have red rings to do that with, well in that case, we
have an inner cooler. You know, that wonderful
accessory that we've tried on many, many, many occasions and has never done anything. Let's try it here! So the claim to fame with this one isn't so much to allow the
temperatures to run a little bit cooler when you're
normally using your Xbox 360, but for when you've got
it in a confined space it's supposed to direct hot
air away from the console. Okay, so this is a pretty
small inner cooler, I will say, so basically
you've got one fan on the inside which actually
kind of looks like a GPU fan, and then I
guess it sort of mounts onto the sides, like that? (paper crinkling) Seems a little bit excessive. Don't you just clip it on to the side? Yeah, you just clip it on the side. There we go. That doesn't look like the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen. And of course, because everything here is mounted via USB, I'm
going to use up the last port on the back of the Xbox. I gotta say, that is
looking a little bit more like the ultimate Xbox 360. What fell? All right, so we've got
some decent stuff here, the Xbox is going to be cool, it's going to have an HD DVD experience, we're going to have wireless
rechargeable controllers, and a Kinect which is useful for all kinds of games that are not called Just Dance. However, there's one
last piece that I think is gonna really pull this all together. So this is the Vault for Xbox 360, and it's a little bit unusual. So if you pop it open
here what you're going to find is that not only is that all going to be branded with Battlefield 3, but it's esentially a case for the 360. It's a little bit weird. So they use it as like a, ""Oh, look, you can sort of mount
a control on the side of it, make it look all cool."" But I don't know why you want this. Oh, oh wow, okay. Assembly instructions. When I say I'm going to be building the ultimate Xbox 360, I didn't think I actually had to literally build it. Okay. (laughing) Well, this is a thing in multiple pieces, so it looks like a claymore
and a smoke grenade? And so with that, we have
the ultimate Xbox 360 in all its really
ridiculous plastic glory. So after a quick battery
change, we've got a, you know, the LEDs working on
our super cool claymore so, you know, that's a thing. Hey look, it's got me. So this is what it looks like with Kinect when you actually have, you
know, a working skeleton. We also do have everything showing up so it shows our 500GB
hard drive, as well as our 476GB SSD, and we also
have the HD DVD player which has 191MB free. So of course, we're going to have to play a game with this setup, and
what better than Skyrim, which apparently is better with Kinect. Oh no, tray doesn't wanna open. I think our tray is busted. It just took three tries to open up. That's fine, that's what you should expect out of the ultimate Xbox 360. It's really weird to
put a disc in a system and not have to wait for it to download and patch and update, it just starts. Maybe this is the ultimate
console after all. So apparently I can use Kinect to shout voice commands in Skyrim,
which doesn't sound particularly useful. Wow, what revolutionary Kinect gameplay. I'm really amazed at the
power of this technology. Super helpful. Actually here's something curious. So I've got Skyrim in
the DVD drive right now and it shows ""Play Skyrim,""
but I also now have an HD DVD in the HD DVD player, so how do I actually get to that? My Video apps. (gasps) Oh, we found it! There's an HD DVD app. Oh no, ""Can't read this disc, if it's a game CD or disc put it in your Xbox 360 disc tray."" Come on, are you serious? My Xbox, my ultimate
Xbox, it's all failing me So, that my friends is how not to build the ultimate Xbox 360
with lots of components which are of dubious value
or don't work at all. So, hopefully you found this helpful. If you did, please watch some of the other Building the Ultimate series, which I can assure you are much, much better.",9:55
u3XSfVPFM74,Car Throttle,Automobile,The Differences Between V6 and Straight-Six Engines,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3XSfVPFM74,5 years ago,4.8M views,Automobile,v6 versus straight-6 engines the pros and cons 6-cylinder engines have featured in some heroic cars over the years with the likes of the Toyota Supra and bmw m3 paving the way for the straight six and the Honda NSX and r35 gt-r cementing the v6 into everyone's automotive psyche sadly though the glory days of the straight six seem to be numbered as v6 turbos are commonly used in many of the world's greatest sports and supercars so what are the advantages and shortcomings of each setup and why does the v6 now dominates straight-6 advantages like any inline engine straight-6 engines are fairly simple because there's no need for cylinder offset separate heads or valve trains like in a V configuration and instead of using double the amount of smaller camshafts a double overhead cam inline six can simply use two longer camshafts to open and close its valves access to an inline six is spark plugs leads and ancillary for general maintenance is also pretty easy making this engine an amatuer mechanics friend the biggest advantage of the straight six however is its balance due to the normal firing order of a straight-6 the Pistons move in tandem with their mirror image on the other side of the engine block meaning that the reciprocating forces balance each other out this makes for a smooth revving engine for which units like the s50 and RB 26 have become synonymous for straight-6 disadvantages unfortunately for its fans there are a few big disadvantages that mean the straight-6 is all but dead in today's automotive landscape packaging has always been an issue as the extra two cylinders when compared to an inline four mean that mounting an engine in a transverse configuration is very difficult and if mounted sideways there usually isn't enough room for the size of transmission and drivetrain needed to use a straight-6 in a front-wheel drive setup the long engine and its components also lack rigidity when compared to a more compact engine setup the long camshafts and crank shafts naturally try to flex slightly during rotation along with the engine block lacking the stiffness of a v6 equivalent the dimensions of the inline six also don't help the car center of gravity with rotating and Static mass sitting slightly higher in the engine bay than other more compact engine options v6 advantages normally found in 60 or 90 degree configurations v6 still find their place in many current performance cars including the Nissan or 35 GTR and the new Honda NSX compared to inline engines v6 s are far more compact which makes it a good unit to shoehorn into multiple manufacturer platforms therefore cutting costs from research and development budgets the pressure space offered up by the neat package also opens the door to forced induction leaving room for turbochargers - nestled deep within the engine bay front wheel drive vehicles can also use a v6 engine more easily including cars such as a masa M x6 which squeezed in a 2.5 liter v6 in its second generation so the v6 allowed car companies to easily produce a performance variant of their usual boring four-cylinder cars without having to drastically change chassis dimensions or engine bay organization v6 disadvantages although it may feature the same number of cylinders as its in-line brother the v6 does not have the same intrinsic balance effectively made up of using two in-line three cylinders stuck together the V style engine needs balancing shafts that you specially place weights to counteract the unwanted inertia created by the reciprocating engine without these balancing shafts large vibrations would travel through the crankshaft and offset the efficiency of the reciprocation the engine balance is worsened as displacement increases because of the longer piston stroke and an increase in bore size the counterweights needed therefore add complexity to the engines design and manufacture increasing overall costs naturally a double overhead cam v6 must have four camshafts and potentially 24 valves in total so the complexity of the additional valve train components increases the complexity of this engine which can make working on v6 is difficult for less experienced car lovers whichever side of the fence you sits on when it comes to favoring either the v6 or the straight-6 the good news is that the straight-6 could be making a comeback recently Mercedes revealed its new modular m256 inline 6 engine with up to 480 horsepower that will use a 48 volt battery to power the ancillary components and help the powertrain it'll also emit 15 percent less co2 and will replace almost all applications of the existing gasoline v6 so in years to come we could be seeing a more equal splits of v6 and straight-6 engine which is great news in my book people often confuse drifting with power sliding and there is quite a big difference so today we've got the BMW m2 and we're gonna teach you the differences and how to initiate them [Music],4:46

you've been very very patient here this will help me forget forget your troubles forget your cares ah welcome handy well so anything you like to tell me you poor thing how now now have some patience I will make everything better well she's been crazy for a long time so Adela is gone man I'm wondering I by wonder what sanctuary bros putting in this incense and she's I know that laugh so she's no good to us you was up ah your life spin a web bar see through your deceit I did not learn from books no I learned it all with my own mind ah boss online that's kind of I wonder if that social commentary right there because talking to that guy is like talking to the internet sometime oh hello this thing has actually been there the whole entire game but we couldn't see it before the Blood Moon was out the pale Blood Moon was out but if you get your inside up high enough you actually can see it early but it has been there the whole game and since I have high insight now you see these guys have eyeballs on their lanterns as if they've been collecting eyeballs as well and they can use magic with it as well so really interesting stuff but last time a lot of people are going to say that maybe that wasn't the little girl's sister because the little girl never mentioned that she had a sister I personally tend to believe that it was her sister and her sister had some jealousy over the ribbon she wanted the ribbon and no matter what you do that little girl is and some serious trouble like even if you don't tell her to go somewhere it seems like her sister has her go somewhere so that she'll get killed so that she can get the rhythm because she's jealous but don't think too badly of the sister because this moon is [ __ ] with people listen to me it's [ __ ] with people seriously Oh is that you again I'm afraid of mid-pacific lotta I'm just going to have a short rest though don't worry I've taken blood enough to save an old woman no more dreams for me this is my last chance what a fool I am they'll have to tread carefully but that thing still lies in wait turn back this is my score to settle I pray lies in wait this way turn back this is my score to settle so Eileen hints at her age but even more importantly it's more confirmation that through the mechanic the explanation of the mechanic of reviving when we die is the dream no more dreams for her so this is her last chance this ball are not boss this NPC fight is probably the hardest fight in the game honestly it's probably harder than the ball any of the bosses you see a couple bullet shots from that repeating pistol and got a chikage got a ton of health this [ __ ] has a ton of health can heal can parry you and one shot you this is a very strong opponent that does not necessarily follow the same rules we do you'll notice when they trance when the enemy transforms chikage it does take damage and it's very possible and in fact likely that you will glitch the fight out on these stairs and then the idiot will just stand there and die with the chikage and transform mode like that's pretty common I did not want to win the fight that way and you will see me actually accidentally glitch it here in a minute now I think it is intended an intended method of fighting this enemy to let them transform the chikage and then back off and like make them chase you and lose their health that's kind of anybody that's going to transform the chikage you know buy yourself some time let them lose some he'll but but it does actually get stuck on the stairs here like this but I'm not having it I don't really want to win that way so I just hit it and restarted the fight but it's a very difficult very difficult battle and you see I've almost got it dead I've almost got it dead but almost only counts in horseshoes and hand-grenades so I decided to go back and we're going to use some insight we're going to buy some twin bloodstone shards I'm going to upgrade people have been wanting to see the threaded cane so I thought you know I'll try a different weapon against this enemy anyway so we're going to do that upgrade a threaded cane use that in the battle on the Lord for this enemy there's a couple of things it's wearing a cainhurst helmet but it's wearing a hunter of hunters crow garb so it's a little bit a little bit unclear as to what specifically this is supposed to be perhaps a hunter of hunters that has joined the vilebloods instead I mean this is we've actually seen this in Dark Souls 1 you know we had infamous dark wraiths who became a member of the chaos servants in Kirk so they do those sorts of things in the games so maybe that's hinting that that's what this thing is Eileen refers to it is but yeah we're seeing the effects of this Blood Moon on people and here I'm going to swap my runes out I think I ended up going with the claw mark rune instead of the moon rune the moon rune because claw Mart gives you more visceral attack damage and frankly against this particular enemy parrying and doing a this roll attack is pretty much the most reliable means of damage and we're going to get that threaded cave and we got to pump that threaded cane up but yeah um the moon is messing with people so bad it's blurred the line between men and beasts but there's also something else going on there's basically two stories going on in blood-borne there's a gothic horror story and there's also a cosmic horror story so it's a little bit gothic or a whole lot Lovecraft and it just kind of goes back and forth between the two here I wanted to show you guys how cool it looks when you have bolt paper on the threaded cane oh man it looks so sweet and I'm just going to back off and let this fool damage itself the enemy is using the old hunter bone which is what creates this kind of teleport effect on the role I'll talk more specifics about the bones effects later but it is actually fairly useful it's another one of those I think it requires 15 arcane if I remember correctly so it's kind of for hybrid builds I would say but this jerk can heal can and will heal multiple times in a battle I had nothing missed I only had to poison knives I was really kind of wanting to chuck some poison knives at it because to me that's just a clever strategy more than a glitch I mean you'd poison the enemy it's that's what its intended to do but I didn't have any poison knives and only two numbing mists I was thinking well that ain't really gonna help a whole lot you see me I keep trying to go wit mode because whip mode you can actually out range the chikage or at least the way this NPC is using it you can out range the chikage and so with the bolt paper on I was getting pretty good damage and then he healed he or she I can't actually know if this is male or female but um so annoying and this battle right here continued for several minutes we're gonna skip ahead several minutes in the fight I don't want to make you guys watch the whole thing you see I've used ten vials at this point minutes later I get one shot well not once I'd already lost some health but it would have been a one shot anyway how do I know it would have been a one shot anyway where so there you go lesson learned don't uh don't just run up and swing in wit mode when he's got that gun out because [ __ ] [ __ ] this is a this is a pretty legitimately difficult battle um what would I say about it it's really weird this is gonna this is it's gonna piss off a lot of people I actually enjoyed it I found it to be fairly fun but it is a lot less satisfying due to the fact that the the enemy doesn't follow the same rules that the player does right can swing all day can shoot all day has thousands of HP and can heal all of it quickly while simultaneously being able to one-shot two player with a parry like it it's it's one of those things where this has been ever since like the days of the regular Nintendo we're like you would be playing a game and bat type enemies could fly through walls that your character couldn't pass through you see me using gnome and mist saying I'm gonna try to keep you from healing it's not gonna work ah but I mean the numbing with Miss does work but it wears off and it takes so long to kill this guy another thing I guess I should point out though I am using a +6 weapon then this is kind of this is really an in-game side quest so you could easily have a plus nine or ten when fighting this enemy and it's not quite as ridiculous in that situation but uh so I guess the fact that this enemy doesn't necessarily follow the same rules that the player does is going to make it feel cheap to some people and I expect and I don't mind if you guys sound off in the comments if you feel like this fight is cheap this [ __ ] go ahead and say this fight is cheapest [ __ ] because you ain't gonna get no argument from me but at the same time I did enjoy doing it the legit way like it just it was fun and I guess I guess what I'm trying to say is I think sometimes it's okay for games to cheat a little bit I think there's a limit to how much they should cheat and when I say cheat I'm saying have the enemy follow a different rule set then the player has to follow I think it's okay for games to cheat a little bit because sometimes that allows you to like they wanted this to be like fighting against another player but there's no way that they can make this like fighting against another player although they do a pretty good job with some of these random - is followed by gunshots it got me a couple of times there but since they can't do that instead you know giving it a ton of HP making it so that it can one-shot you like they did these things to make the fight challenging I don't know I'm kind of torn on it I enjoyed the fight but I tend to prefer challenges where the enemy follows the same rules that I do I love those double dashes that it does sometimes they I swapped back to his staff mode as soon as he brought that gun back out like he had transformed Chicago out and I was like all right [ __ ] this was so stupid I was gonna try to go in he had transformed Chicago yawn I'm like I really need a gun so I'm out range you with the threaded cane which is what I'm gonna try to do here oh by the way I'm attacking in the empty space it may just look like I'm missing it's kind of a similar principle to footsies in a fighting game you attack where the enemy wants to be rather than actually where they are like you you know they're going to try to come forward and so you swing into that space hoping to catch them while they're attempting to come forward that's why I'm doing that in case you were wondering it's not just me having poor range although it kind of meant okay some of it's me having poor rekt oh god dang that repeating pistol people keep talking about Evelyn Evelyn Evelyn Evelyn now and I like repeating pistol if you're gonna use a gun to deal damage use the one that deals a ton of damage in a single shot and it's not as extreme as the Canon and it's it's bullet consumption Evelyn is like per bullet the most effective but I don't find the two bullet consumption of the repeating pistol to be that much of a burden for the extra damage that it does that's my opinion obviously people people love the Evelyn love the alkaline net it's all good there's lots of different ways to play subdued I guess I should say since people keep asking yes I'm gonna do a lore series this is why I'm doing this playthrough is to gather footage for Laura series man I just had a [ __ ] take it take a breather for a second there after that I was like oh [ __ ] man I earned this [ __ ] I earned this [ __ ] like it was a really fun fight it was really good and as usual I didn't want to make you guys watch the whole thing but I didn't want to edit the deaths out completely because uh that's part of the game dying is part of the game it's absolutely dying as part of the experience the warmth of blood darker hunter technique resonates with servants of the Queen Carrie of the child of blood who yearned for the Queen's blood with little hope of Requirement blood rapture serves as a surrogate for their desires we've read this before I think we got the previous one from shadows of yharnam and which Queen of blood they actually leave that ambiguous there are two different Queens that we could think of as actually being the queen of blood but we'll have to talk more on that another time maybe it cainhurst don't you ever listen to your elders no matter you did save my life I don't seem to be out for this life anymore my glory days were long a girl now I know hey for you this too is hunters work but it bears no honor a burden you may choose to carry the decision is yours alone my eyes grow heavy let me rest a while I'll be fine just wait and so we have become Eileen successor as the hunter of hunters I guess I was just showing my stats there so you can see +6 level 5125 skill 31 bit is the way I just did that fight we got the hunter of hunters rooms stamina recovery speed up this red smudge rune indicates hunter and it has been adopted by those who have taken the hunter of hunters oath these Watchmen admonished those who have been addled with blood be they men or beasts anyone who has threatened the pleasures of the hunter oath surely has an issue with blood the hunter symbol that's the the truest hunter right there is honor of honors but how different is that from a normal hunter really because beasts were humans in the first place anyway those who have become addled with blood the badge of the hunters hunter of hunters is quietly passed down from generation to generation usually to an outsider from the hinterlands to be entrusted with this cursed badge one must be strong resilient to the seduction of blood and gracious when taking a comrades life on we are that we fit this we're an outsider we're a foreigner although we don't know that we're from the hinterlands and hinterlands is a something that's going to come up in our challenge dungeons aren't chalice dungeon runs which we are going to run the chalice dungeons before finishing the game we need to from a lore perspective so you'll notice that the doll is still laying there I can actually level up this is what she appears like after you've interacted whether but you have zero insight and the main thing that I'm gonna do here is I am going to purchase and upgrade the blade of Mercy which is probably going to be the weapon that I end up using splits into two when activated the weapons warped blades are forged with siderite a rare mineral of the heavens most effective and swift attacks such as after quick stepping it's one of the oldest weapons of the workshop this is a pretty good pretty good pretty good weapon it's really good like it says after quick steps and after rolls it actually has really good attacks the beat contains incense to mask sense of blood and beast addresses crows to suggest sky burial the first hunter of hunters came from a foreign land and gave the dead of virtuous Native funeral ritual rather than impose a blasphemous yarn on burial service upon them with the hope that the former compatriots might be returned to the skies and find rest in a hunter's dream so the incense is a big lure point maybe this is how the hunter of hunters despite hunting people who have these issues with blood and who have these these problems where they're turning into beasts like they're hunting they're hunting kind of the worst beasts the you know humans can become beasts well you can we know clerics become fearsome beasts well it should be assumed to that hunters also become very fearsome beasts but yeah using the mask that contains incense to mask the skip the smell maybe prevents Aileen or other hunter of hunters from being addled by blood so so to speak and you see here I know people been saying why are you hoarding this stuff I don't really I just use the stuff when I need it like blood echo items and inside items humanity items and Dark Souls I just use it when I need it and now at the point we are in the game we can actually buy a twin bloodstone shards with this so I'm going to go ahead and use this just to get the shards that I need to upgrade my blade of Marci up to +6 and that means we now have the threaded cane the blade of mercy and the rifles barrel at +6 and we'll probably keep leveling up the blade of mercy I cut out the part where I put the gems back in it and all that because it's just whatever here you see me I ultimately leveled it must scale a little bit the blade of Marcy's got that a scaling or I think it I think eventually becomes s it's got really good scaling with skill is the main point so raising our skill increases our damage and now we're going to the forbidden woods because uh we're gonna go pay fake yosef got another visit you see you're just playing around with my new toy like to play to mercy we're probably gonna do some fashion Souls coming up pretty soon - you're gonna we're gonna have to change our look I mean the rifles spirit of me it kind of goes pretty good with the Henrick stuff but blade of mercy needs something more like stealthy ninja ish kind of I don't know I got to come up with something else um but I'm just gonna take this kind of trap slash shortcut and just jump off here and the next episode will be cainhurst so for people who are wanting to play ahead I will probably be almost certainly be heading to cainhurst next so take your summons to him with crossing don't delay blade of mercy actually there are several different ways you can use it one really nasty way is when you have it in two-handed mode its attacks are very very fast very very rapid so putting in dirty gems or marquee gems to give it a poison effect you can build up poison damage really really fast it's it's actually pretty useful honestly it may be better for doing quick poison then what you call it chikage it might be I don't know what do you guys think to me to me honestly at this point one of my it's not a criticism of blood-borne because it's not like an objective failing of the game in fact a lot of people will find it to be a virtue but to me the game overall is just too goddamn dark there are hints throughout the game that this may in fact be all just a dream and I think that some of what the beggar says about starting over after the night of the hunt passes like despite the state that yharnam is in right now he still feels like can start over I mean that's not one of the most clear guns but there are there are a number of hints throughout the game that this might all just be just a dream I don't know it may be that it may not be that here I'm showing that the blade of Mercy does have some thrust attacks that's not but the backstep are - actually is a thrust attack can see it very well on those enemies because they're resistant to normal physical attacks it's another thing I'm really really really really ready for the guy to go ahead and drop so that you guys can see all the damage types of all the attacks because some of them will surprise you and it kind of changes which gems that you want to use depending on what type of attacks we need just playing around killing these crows an l2 back step alright now this confrontation has been building the whole game fake yosef qey notice that those blue guys don't disappear that's another hint that those are NPCs and not just normal enemies and into the room where she's been doing all of her experiments fake yosef qey likes it doggystyle fake yosef get confirmed best waifu sorry I'm sorry did just I'm sorry but she is clearly having some issues her attire is pertinent to the story as well first let's hear what she has to say god I'm nauseous have you found this it's progressing I can see things I knew it I'm different I know Beast I got is awful but it proves that I'm chosen don't you see how they ride rides inside my head it's rather rapture god I'm nauseous it's progressing I knew it it's that's waifu have some mercy that writhes keyword in there Odin the Odin arrived here we have another one of these umbilical cords Provost this this was their one we originally had uh yarns for a surrogate precipitated the encounter with the pale moon beckoned the hunters and conceived the hunter's dream this was the one that we previously had every infant great one has this precursor to the umbilical cord this is the new one Provost William sought the court in order to elevate his being and thoughts to those of a great one by lining his brain with eyes the only choice if he in the only choice he knew if man were to ever master or match their greatness sorry my previews really small I can't really read that uh so every infant great one has these things we know it precipitated the encounter with the pale moon with the pale blood moon it led to the encounter with the pale Blood Moon which beckoned and it's it's really really interesting because we're using babies to beckon the moon but the moon beckon the hunters and conceive the hunters dream so good God Almighty and this is more evidence once again that Willem may have actually literally been trying to have eyes on the inside of his head and she said she can see things that they arrived it's like she was seeing things inside of her own head this borderline between evolution and insanity here her garb is that of the choir if I remember right and so we'll deal with that in a bit but for now have mercy,33:13

8HEfIJlcFbs,Mark Rober,Science,World Record Domino Robot (100k dominoes in 24hrs),0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HEfIJlcFbs,6 months ago,32M views,Science,this is dom he's a friendly little robot that's super good at only one thing setting up a butt ton of dominoes really really fast it's taken five years to get to this point but according to our initial tests we have hopes that he might be more than ten times faster than the fastest human so today we're gonna put him to the test going head-to-head against the world's foremost domino expert who unfortunately is a mere human then we're gonna attempt a guinness world record and he's gonna try and fill this entire warehouse with a mural of a hundred thousand dominoes and for context setting up a domino mural that size would take a team of seven skill builders one full week dom here is gonna attempt to do it by himself in 24 hours now i know what you're thinking big whoop mark because as a kid you might have had a toy that looked like this or even this custom robot kiwico maybe that can drop 20 dominoes in a row so isn't it a bit overkill to utilize an autonomous robot a half mile of hot wheels tracks and a high speed robotic arm and i get it because our designs look like this where we would just try and hack a little roomba when we first tried to tackle this problem exactly five years ago but then pesky details with scale arise like for starters just how much a hundred thousand dominoes is so the robot will need to come and reload at least a thousand times but how exactly do you reload it and how would it know exactly where to drop each domino and what color it should be and how do you make it so reliable that it doesn't screw up once in a hundred thousand drops of a domino a system to reliably tackle issues at scales like this is just going to be inherently super complex like 10 times more complex than my automatic bullseye dartboard which to this point was probably the most complicated build on my channel so after failing off and on for three years i was doing a q a at maker faire and i told the crowd if anyone wanted to help me with the brutal challenge to hit me up afterwards and to my absolute delight two freshmen from stanford and a software engineer from the bay area all took me up on the challenge so i hired them and two years later here we were now before i show you how it all works i first wanted to put him in a head-to-head competition to see how good he really was and for that we need the undisputed heavyweight champion on youtube for all things dominoes lily havish lily you are known on youtube as the queen of dominoes right people do call me the domino queen and for very good reason with over 1.2 billion views on her channel you've almost certainly seen one of her incredible creations over her 12 years on the platform she's so good she's even got her own line of dominoes you can buy in stores okay so here's the challenge lily i want you to set up like 300 dominoes right now and let's see how long it takes a human to do that okay okay clock starts now [Music] i gotta do two hands if you need me lily just sitting here reading my newspaper for you kids at home a newspaper is like a boring ipad made from trees that's actually pretty fast [Music] the foibles of being a human okay lily are you ready for this i've seen enough i actually don't know how to whistle this is the dominator oh my god wow i love the eyes a good set of googly eyes will go a long ways okay boy let them down i suck at domino's lily but i'm good at engineering which means i'm actually really good at dominoes we even showed off the dominator double stacked the middle row for you that is impressive that is seriously impressive this technique of laying down a tile of 300 dominoes at once was really the key that helped us crack the scale and reliability issues and it's probably my favorite part about the dominator besides his wiggly tail of course here's josh to explain more so we have these 3d printed funnels here which allow us to drop all 300 dominoes all at once and the mechanism that drops those into the top of this tray we'll show that in just a second and if we remove these funnels here we can see that the dominoes are precisely placed in their locations this allows us to place 300 dominoes exactly where we want them all at once and they don't fall out because of what we call the connect 4 mechanism under here but if we trigger the servo then it slides that connect4 tray over and drops them all at once making for some gratuitous beautiful slow-mo shots [Music] and so while this looks really cool obviously dropping from that height wouldn't be effective so we lowered the whole platform down on this ball screw then set them right on the floor which turned out to be incredibly reliable so dom took the w in round one but now it's time for the endurance round okay first one to ten thousand dominoes wins lily you ready i'm ready dominator you ready start [Music] oh my god wow i already fell that's great [Music] and to lily's credit she was actually insanely fast just not you know robot fast so unfair so unfair on top of that she had to handle a very large distraction with the emotional maturity of a nine-year-old yep i think i'm doing pretty good [Music] you're doing very good for a human i'll give you that oh [Music] that feels so much faster than it probably looks how's lily doing tired and so while lily's output slowed down considerably doms did not and i should mention we sometimes call him dom but that's a short for his legal birth name which as noted before is dominator because you know like domino dominator whatever it all works i'm gonna head to the bathroom oh lily has to go to the bathroom i'm human right dominator do you have to go to the bathroom didn't think so [Music] nine thousand perfectly laid dominoes in a little over two hours actually 9001 we got a bonus domino out there in the middle of this field may or may not have been on purpose but now we can say it's actually over 9 000. it was a pretty clear result and lily of course was gracious in her defeat to the machine overlords so all that was left to do now was to knock him down yes that was satisfying so we went head-to-head with the world's foremost domino expert and came out on top and now it's time for the real challenge to attempt a guinness world record and see how quickly we could fill this entire room with a mural of over a hundred thousand dominoes all right buddy you got the game plan now you just gotta get out there and execute [Music] godspeed little fella godspeed 300 dominoes down 102 000 left to go [Music] so [Music] so we're about six hours in but more importantly we just got our first goomba this is beautiful back to work dom and the best part about working really hard for a few years is that the last 24 hours are super relaxing and with that tile placed we are officially halfway done with over 50 000 dominoes put down in just a little bit over 12 hours and dom whoa easy boy just showing no signs of slowing down so this is a good point to explain the rest of the robotic system it all starts over here with the loading station that josh and john luke spent a lot of time optimizing the dominoes are loaded by color on these conveyor belts and then a kuka robot arm grabs them and places them in one of 300 loading shoots made from 2.7 miles worth of hot wheel tracks and you could load dom directly with the robot arm but this is much faster because he doesn't have to wait he just comes in here to the docking station and the lower platform slides over so the bottom layer of 300 dominoes gets loaded up all at once and we also had a backup loading system using a tray just in case at any point the robot arm wasn't working besides the hot wheels tracks there's a ton of 3d printed parts throughout the build that we either printed ourselves or if we were in a pinch my friends at matterhackers helped us out so that's the loader now how about the dominator himself how does dom know exactly where to go in the room to drop a domino so we've pre-programmed the route for all 102 000 dominoes so the robot knows exactly where to go right from the start then as we're driving around we use these indoor gps sensors to track the position of the robot so it knows roughly where it is and then as we get closer to the place the dominoes need to drop we use these ir cameras that are tracking markers on the ground to make sure the robot lines up perfectly every single time so the vision from the beginning is that we could set dom up we could turn off the lights and leave and come back the next morning and you've got like a full field of dominoes set up you can work all night in the dark just fine all right now how about these super cool wheels so these are called omni wheels and they're awesome because they let you translate it any direction you want so this is way better than like your car where if you need to move a little bit to the left to right you have to make like a five point turn so with these guys you can move any direction you want to adjust for small corrections in the placement of the dominoes these wheels are powered by these clearpath brushless dc servo motor these are like the gold standard in terms of speed and accuracy and they allow us to slide the robot around by even just a couple millimeters at a time which is super useful we're trying to make real fine adjustments for placing the dominoes down now obviously that's just the uppermost tip of the iceberg tip but dom's brain is over 14 000 lines of code all from scratch so if you want to go way deeper into the technical details i'll put a link in the video description where alex put it all in one spot now back to finishing the second half [Music] see [Music] [Music] so the dominator has been running just under 24 hours and this is a bit of a momentous tile here [Music] it's a me mario [Music] 102 300 dominoes are on the floor successfully this is the last 300. i think this is a moment you guys get back over here josh and alex let's observe it don't blow this dom you got it buddy finish strong we got it just over 24 hours to lay all the dominoes gentlemen it feels really fulfilling as an engineer to see the design process yield results like this and speaking of the engineering design process my month-long creative engineering course where i teach this process and where you watch me make three builds from scratch and you make three creative builds of your own is once again open for enrollment for a bonus summer session right now so go to monthly.comrober or use the link in the video description and i'll see you in class so now with everything set up the final critical step was to knock him down you can see john loading in the mario pipes because they were going to be our trigger mechanism the way that works is we've got four hot wheel cars glued to the bottom of this platform that rides in these parallel hot wheels tracks then you slap a green sliding shell on top and a motor at the end pulls the card along the tracks with a string then the shell contacts the lever arm at each pipe like this which causes them to roll forward down the ramp hopefully into the dominoes okay now i'm nervous i wasn't nervous now i'm nervous okay three two one go five oh my god got it yes awesome holy cow [Music] oh my gosh [Music] and in the end dom was 50 times faster than a skilled domino builder and he got himself a world record to show for it although to be fair to us organisms it was in the non-human category and at that point after five years we were just so relieved to be done we got a little carried away celebrating the champ with an appropriate send-off six-year-old me would be so stoked to know that i would eventually build a robot that could set up all the dominoes for me so if you want the same feeling of making things with your hands to do cool things but you don't want to wait 35 years then my friends at kiwiko have got the answer in fact this is an actual mini version of the dom i designed together with them just for this video i mean how awesome and adorable is that he's like the protege the dom jr they've got an incredible team of designers that work on each project and honestly if i wasn't making youtube videos i think i would apply to be on their team then all the concepts are kid tested and then it's delivered right to your door every month so you can foster your creativity and make your abilities in a fun and natural way so for example for this domino machine box inside you've got all the supplies you'll need to put it together you've got simple instructions and then a booklet with more info like a q a with someone you might know and this is the tinker crate line but they've got eight different subscription lines each catering to a different age group and topic so if you want to support my channel and feed your brain while having fun at the same time go to cubico.com roverdomino or use the link in the video description to get an exclusive offer so thanks to kiwico for being so great to work with thanks to dom and dom jr for just dominating of course thanks to you for watching what do we do now we're about to clean it up oh there we go a cleanup robot you,15:58

wYALykLb5oY,Coder Coder,"Tech,Informative",Building a Node.js app (as a JavaScript noob) | 🔴 LIVE CODING,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYALykLb5oY,7 months ago,81K views,"Tech,Informative","hello everyone in this video we'll be building 
this dinosaur generator web app using node.js   and javascript it's nothing too fancy but 
when you click the button it'll generate   a fake dinosaur name and a random dinosaur image 
to go with it the cool part is that the dinosaur   information is coming from two apis the app uses 
javascript to get the api data on the server   and then passes it to the client side to display 
the data on the website the apis themselves are   loaded through rapid api which has an api 
hub with lots of different ones you can use   rapid api is sponsoring this video and i thought 
it would be a good opportunity to build something   using apis which is an important skill to have 
the only problem is that i've literally never   used node to build a website i'm not exaggerating 
here i have programmed a little in c sharp but i'm   a javascript noob so i figured i'd show you 
how much i have to look up when i'm coding   it'll be fun i did have to research a bunch 
to get this working and i'm super grateful   to the coding trained youtube channel with 
their playlist on apis and javascript webdav   simplified's video on building a weather app code 
stacker with their video on using multiple apis   and anya kubo's videos explaining asynchronous 
javascript they were all extremely helpful   resources and i've put links to all of them down 
in the description all right let's get into it   okay so the first thing we want to do is we want 
to set up our website so since i am using node   need to install express because i'm going 
to be using that to make the website so in   our terminal window let's go up here and 
we're going to install npm install express   um actually i first need to npm init entry point 
yes index.js okay i think that's what i need   so got a package.json file i think what i saw in 
i believe is the video from web they've simplified   is under scripts we're going to set dev 
and then in here we want to use nodemon   which will automatically reload your 
node server anytime you make a change   and the entry point is going to be 
index.js so we got that now let us install   express and we need to install nodemon 
npm install node mon save dev too excited okay so now we got express and we have our nodemon 
installed the next thing i want to do is actually   create the like the the app one thing i found 
was pretty helpful was express has pretty good   documentation so here on their website is a hello 
world example so for our app here we're going to   require express so i'm going to copy that i 
don't think i need that version number in our   project we're going to create index.js and this 
is going to be where we run node so this is our   server side javascript so i'll paste that in and 
i don't know i use semicolon to the end of my line   i know not everybody does that but basically the 
first line is importing the express module then   we're going to create an app an express app and 
then we want to set the port so this is where   which port we're going to load our local 
website the next thing i want to do   i believe is let's go back to the docs 
so what i want to do is i'm not running   the apps strictly from javascript but i'm going to 
have like an index.html file and some other static   files like css and javascript so 
i think here serving static files okay so use a following code to serve images css 
files and javascript files and directory named   public so i believe this is what i want 
to use so this will say that we're using   the public folder and i think i forgot 
one thing oh yeah here we go so listen   so this is telling the server to listen for any 
requests made at the port which is three thousand   and it includes this hyperlink here so the 
server is going to listen for 3000 um if the   browser makes requests to load this local website 
using port 3000 then it'll serve the website so   the next thing i need to do is since i'm serving 
my static assets from the public folder i need   to make a public folder so public and in the 
public folder i'm going to create index.html   and then i'm also going to create a style.css file 
and then my client-side javascript which will just   say script.js so in our index.html just to create 
some boilerplate and change the tile to dinosaur   generator and i'll just add some text here 
the same thing dinosaur generator okay   and then even though we have blank css let's 
just add the references so that's correct   um and then we're going to add a script to 
load the script.js file is that right oh boy   yeah i think that's right we'll find out 
let's just test console.log script.js loaded and then for style i guess i can 
just start adding some boilerplates   so font size 100 this will make things more 
responsive uh box sizing quarter box and then   for all elements as well as the before and after 
pseudo elements we will say box sizing inherit   and then for the body we'll just 
say margin zero adding zero and   i think this is fine for now okay so now that 
we have our static files i think i can just try   to run this now so in our package.json file when 
we created this we said we have a dev script and   when we run dev in the command line it's going to 
run nodemon index.js so let's try that so npm run   dev and see what happens okay cool so 
it's saying example app is listening so   load this up in our browser see if that 
loaded oh and it did so if we inspect this it is loading and let's just make sure 
that we yeah so our script.js did load   and then our um css so let's just see yeah 
so you can see here font size 100 box sizing   border blocks coming from style.css make this 
a little bit bigger so you can see it better   there we go okay so it looks like things are 
loading all of our static assets are loading   so this is our local express site so i guess 
that was kind of easy it's kind of funny because   i i definitely wouldn't say that i'm like 
a expert programmer but i used to do more   full stack stuff i'm in c sharp and this is 
just much different it's pretty interesting   how you can just with these few lines of code 
spin up an entire server so i can kind of see   the appeal of this because you can just write this 
in vs code you don't need to set up a whole bunch   of other stuff now the next thing we want to 
do since we have our website running now is to   look at getting the api data so i'm going to go 
to rapid api website and what i'm going to do is   i'm using two apis i'm using the dinosaur lorem 
ipsum thing and then i'm also going to use the   bing image search api so let's just load the 
dinosaur one thing first so it's called dyno ipsum one cool thing about rapid api is that they have 
this tester here so if i click test endpoint   it's going to give me a response so you can see 
here in the results tab this is what it's giving   you back now i don't need all this alarm if some 
filler i actually just want two two words really   so we scroll down here are the parameters that you 
can set so paragraphs it's giving me 30 paragraphs   i really just want one and words number of words 
per paragraph i want to and then format let's do   json just because i think i feel like most apis 
will give you json so we may as well do that even   though i guess text would be just as good so now 
with our new parameters let's retest the endpoint   and we can see the result is an array with these 
two dinosaur names i don't even know if they're   real dinosaur names but you know we'll see so 
what we're going to do is we are going to copy   the code from rapid api we're going to use 
the fetch function so i'm going to leave   this here and we're going to go back to our 
code so what we need to do is right now we   want to create a route in express so in our 
index.js file which is the server javascript   we want to create a route which is i don't know if 
i understand it fully but it's almost like sort of   like an api and that the client can make an http 
request to the server to either get information or   to post information if you're submitting 
information from the client to the server   we're going to be using get because we just need 
to get information we're not filling out a form   or submitting anything like that so we are going 
to create our first route and this is going to   load the name of dinosaur so app dot get and then 
this takes a couple parameters the first one is   the path that you're going to use to access 
this route so i'm just going to say dyno name and the second one is the handler function so 
code that you run when this route is hit so   we're using an async function request and 
response and that's the parameters that the   async function is going to take use a little 
arrow function here this is all very new to me so   okay so then in here is we will you 
know run the code run code stuff so the reason we're using an async function 
instead of just i guess a regular function is   because we are pulling data from api we don't 
know exactly how long it's going to take to   get you know the api data to our server 
so that's why you use async so that you   can wait until you've received the data and 
then do something with it otherwise i think   it would just try to run everything at the same 
time and then that may not work out very well   so from what i understand when you use an async 
function then you use the awake keyword for the   things that you want to run i guess in sequence 
so the first thing i want to do is you want to   get or fetch the api data from the api using the 
javascript fetch function so if we go back to   the rapid api site we're just going to copy this 
part here and i do want to make a note here that   you can see my api key displayed here but i'm 
going to delete it after i finish building this   before the video goes out so it's really important 
to make sure your api keys stay secure when you're   working with them so i'm only going to copy this 
fetch section because we're using the async await   thing instead of fetch and then chaining a bunch 
of thens just from what i was reading that seems   to be considered a little bit better syntactically 
so we pasted this stuff in here and you notice   every time we save the file it sort of restarts 
our node server let me just scoot that down a tiny   little bit okay so we got the fetch thing here 
but we want to set it as a constant so const um i'll just say fetch api so we're saving this 
as a constant so this is getting the api data   so once we get the data from the api the fetch 
function returns a javascript promise something i   don't completely understand again but i do 
know that we need to convert the promise into   json format so what we can do is create another 
constant and i think this needs to be a weight   yeah there we go okay another constant and we're 
going to call that the response so dino name   response and this is going to be another await 
because we're running this after the fetch api   thing so await and then we're going to load the 
fetch api but we're going to parse it into json   and then the last thing we want to do is 
because this is a route on the server we need   to respond to any client request with whatever 
you know data we want to send to a client so the   last thing is going to be setting our response 
which is this parameter here response and then   saying it's a json object and then the 
parameter will take the dyno name response   and the other thing we want to do is maybe 
console.log this thing so i'm going to console   blog dino name response and this will write to 
our console down here in our node thing so in   order for the website to be able to get this data 
from the server we need to write some code in our   client-side javascript so we go into script.js 
what we need to do is create another get request   to get the data from the server so the server 
used a get request to get data from the api   then we need to have another get request 
on the client side the website to   get the data from our server i'm going to 
create another async thing because we need   because again since we're using a route an 
api we need to use asynchronous javascript   so we're going to create an async function 
and i'm going to call this get dyno name um let me make sure i named everything correctly 
yeah so dyno named name yeah async function get   dyno name and this is sort of similar to the 
server side javascript so we're going to create   another constant we'll call this the response so 
the response from the server this is going to do   await and then fetch instead of the api stuff 
that we had used previously in our server side   javascript we're fetching the route that we 
just created so dyno name then we want to again   format the um response the the fetch response 
since it's a promise into json and if i have   any mistakes in inaccuracies and what i'm saying 
please leave a comment down below and you know if   i've made any giant giant mistakes i will i'll pin 
a comment or something with the corrections but   i don't know i think i've heard that people 
sometimes feel like you shouldn't do stuff   until you know it completely but i've just learned 
so many things over the course of working as a dev   that i often work on projects that i would do 
things i didn't 100 understand how they worked   but i knew that it kind of worked maybe that's not 
the best way obviously it's better to understand   everything but i feel like it's a pretty realistic 
scenario that you're going to at some point have   to build something that you're not 100 confident 
to know how to do so kind of my purpose in making   this video this way is that so i can show you 
the sort of research process and the testing   and just being really honest about things i don't 
understand like javascript promises okay so where   were we so we got our response from the route 
and then we have a we're making another constant   um of the data and we are formatting it as 
json so i think at this point i'm just going to   console.log the data and hopefully this will mean 
that the data will come from the api to the server   here to the browser and we'll see in the browser 
console whatever data comes back from that yeah   so i think that's good um the next thing we 
want to do is we want to actually execute the   get dyno name function when we load the page okay 
so all the parts are in place let's just see how   the website looks so here's our website here and 
reload this see if anything happened um looks like nothing has happened so let's think 
about this oh i got a error here oh fetch is not defined um let's see if it tells 
you any kind of line number okay so i think   that the problem here is it says the error fetch 
is not defined i kind of forgot i'm using fetch   which is a javascript function i'm using it in 
our node code and you have to install node fetch   which is another module so let me create a 
new terminal thing npm install node fetch and   we'll need this outside of dev as well 
so we'll install it normally okay so now   that we've installed node fetch we can 
say i'll just do it right here so const   fetch and we will require node fetch which 
we just installed this allows you to use   the fetch function in node so let's go back to 
our node thing and oh hey look at that oh man   this is very exciting okay might 
be too big so we can see here the   dinosaur names have come out so this is great 
let's check our website too so we load here maybe i'll put this on the right side so it's not 
blocking stuff okay so here is our dinosaur names   which is pretty awesome so we can see here that it 
is coming in an array which has one array item and   that right item is another array which contains 
these strings so what we need to do is i want to   take the items out of this array and put them into 
a string so that the fake name of the dinosaur is   these two words so first let's take things out 
of the array and try to put it into a string   so let's go into our client-side javascript and i 
think we want so data is that the big array that   we got and since there's only going to be one item 
let's say data and then square brackets and zero   this will return the child the first child 
so let's reload here so now we can see   now there's just an array here what i want to 
do is take these items out of the array and   convert it into a string so how do i figure 
out how to do that so let's use good old   duckduckgo so javascript convert array to string okay w3schools i think isn't 
an okay thing so this will do   fruits to string return the string with 
all the array values separated by commas   i'm not sure if that's what i want 
but let's just try see what happens back to our site okay so separated by a comma   obviously i don't want that i want 
that to be a space instead of a comma let's see convert it right to 
string um and then let's say   space how to convert it right into a 
string without a comma separated by space yeah so this is what i did here 
array to string separated by a comma   oh we can do array join instead of two string 
let's try that so join and then it's saying to   use whatever separator you want so since i want 
a space we'll do quote with a space in there   all right now reload the website hey 
so here is our dinosaur name nice   so i think what i want to do is i'm going to 
create another constant i guess maybe i should   use let in case we want to change that value so 
i'll just say dino name equals and then we'll   get this out here and then console.log dyno 
name so let's go back to the website okay looks   pretty good looks like everything's working 
so back in our function what i want to do for   our final website is i i don't necessarily want to 
run this on page load i mean i guess i could but   i want to have a button so every time you click 
the button it'll generate a new dinosaur image and   then a dinosaur name so let's create our button 
and then we're going to wire up our javascript   to the button click event so over here in our 
index.html i'm just going to create a button and i'm going to give it an id of button   load and then generate dinosaur i think that's 
all i need so now i can take this button load   and i can create um a event listener some 
document query selector button load um   add event listener and then i think i 
can just do another arrow thing maybe see if that works i think 
that's right and then when we   click the button then it's 
going to run this function okay let's see if i did that right so here's my button i'm gonna click it oh yeah   so we have the dinosaur name the next thing we 
want to do is do kind of the same thing for the   dinosaur image that we're going to get from the 
bing image search so we'll start by creating the   route again in our index.js file and then we'll 
create another function here for the get dyno   image so index.js we're going to do basically 
the same thing here so i might just copy this and then change the route name so instead of dyno 
name the route will be called dyno image and then   of course we need to replace this info with 
whatever's in the rapid api thing so going back   to the rapid api um thing image search okay so i 
don't want trending images i want the image search   so their only required 
parameter is the search term so dinosaur and let's see mark it i 
don't think this matters too much um and count that is important so this is 
this is an image search i think let's   return a bunch of images and then we're going 
to choose one one image one random image from   the collection of images so now let's do test 
endpoint and we can see that it's giving us   these are the items so there's a lot of stuff 
in this array here so there's some info up there   and then the actual results are in this value 
field so we'll have to remember that so value   is an object that contains these other each 
result and then each result has a bunch of fields   name thumbnail url they published all 
kinds of things so i think the field   i'm looking for is um i need the image url so 
i think i might just take the thumbnail url   instead of the content url because thumbnail is 
a smaller file so i don't need a giant file here   okay so i'll just remember this for for later so 
let's go back to the code snippets and then select   javascript fetch so you can see here the 
parameter that i added dinosaur and then   count equals 10 is included in here 
so they make this pretty easy to use   um okay so going back here now we're going 
to replace the fetch that was loading the name and replace that with the bing image search okay awesome so let's make sure we have everything 
named here correctly so dyno image is the name   of the route which is good and then dyno name 
response let's just call that dino image response   and then replace that there okay now 
let's add the client side javascript   so going back to our script.js file we're going to 
do the same thing similar things here so instead   of get dyno name is going to be get dyno image and 
we're going to update the route to be dyno image   um and then okay obviously this data stuff is 
something that we it's going to be different   because the data looks different so i think what 
i'm going to do is we'll just say data for now   and then we'll see what we want to 
how we want to sort of parse the data   so dyno image equals data and 
we'll replace this with dyno image   cool all right so then we want to add running 
this function when we click the button okay so let's see if this works i'll go back 
to our website reload and click the button oh yeah look at this okay so i guess we can 
just use a console thing we don't need the   inspector at the moment so we have the 
dinosaur name which is good and then   we have the object from bing 
so again it's let's see in here we need value and then all this stuff 
so what i'm going to do right now is   in the end i do want to just select a random 
dinosaur from this collection of items but just   to make sure we have all the fields named right 
and everything we're just going to hard code   the first result so it's a value and then 
the first result so under the get dyno image   let dino image equals data and then value 
which is that field and then we're going   to take the first result so now let's reload 
the website click the button okay so now it's   returning just the first image and the field that 
we wanted was the thumbnail url so let's take that oh is there an error no it looks okay reload the website click the button okay 
and now we have an image url let's just see   let's just see what this looks like and 
it's a dinosaur image how about that   we have our dinosaur image working so now 
let's add in that the logic to load a random   item from the 10 items that we're getting 
from bing so remember we hard coded the   zero to get just the first item but what we want 
to do is we want to insert a random number so a   random number between zero and then however 
long the array is so since we have received   10 images we want a random number between 0 and 
9. so let's look up how to do that so javascript   get random number and let's see what we come 
back with okay so w3schools is the top thing   turn around number between zero and one okay and 
it's inclusive so it includes zero and then it is   exclusive it excludes one so i think that's good 
because um we're returning ten items but the max   the last the tenth item is actually going to 
be index of nine because we started from zero   so we need to take this and this is only 
zero to one so it's a basically a fraction um   get random array items so i think we need 
something on top of the random thing okay get   a random item for my javascript array this is good 
because you can see there's a ton of votes here so   that kind of indicates that this is probably 
a good answer also it was asked 10 years ago   so let's see what the answers are um okay items 
is the array and then math floor and then math   random so math floor rounds down so if it's like a 
fractional round down to zero and then math random   which will generate a number between zero and one 
times the item's length okay so that makes sense   so take copy that and then here we'll add it here 
so what's happening is math random is going to be   let's say 0.5 and then you multiply it by the 
items by the length of the array which i should   actually change items to data right yeah data so 
data length is 10 because we're getting 10 items   so some fraction times 10 so it'll be somewhere 
between i guess 0 and 10 or it'll be 0 and then   maximum will be 9 i guess and then we round down 
in case there's a decimal so that should work   let's go back to our website reload click 
the button um oh something's undefined   what was undefined oh instead of data length 
it actually needs data value because data   is like the whole thing so like i'm guessing 
that's what was wrong there so let's try again   reload click the button yes cool so if i click 
the button again without reloading is it going   to load a new image or the old image okay they 
look like different images let's just check   so i'll make sure that we're loading a different 
image every time nice and we are sweet so now we   actually have everything we need to um we have 
everything we need in terms of the data to put   into our website so the next step is going 
to be going into our client-side javascript   as well our index.html and then you know 
displaying the name as well as loading an image   from our api data so for the for the name i think 
i might just create a div and we'll say dyno name and then i guess i could create an image tag but i 
feel like it's not great practice to have a blank   image tag um maybe it's not good practice have a 
blank div either but i guess we'll just do these   two different approaches so i think what i'm going 
to do for the images actually generate an image   element in the javascript when we are loading the 
api so first things first let's take care of the   name so dyno name if we go into our script.js 
file going back up to get dyno name so dyno   name is the string that's formatted correctly 
and everything so what we're going to do is   get that div we just made document query selector 
dino name and set the text content to dino name all right see if that works reload the site 
click the button nice if we click the button   again it changes that's awesome okay so that 
was simpler um now for the dyno image we need to   we want to create an image element in 
javascript so let's look up how to do that   so javascript so when i'm looking up stuff i 
usually try to put the language name or whatever   first just to sort of filter out all the results 
so javascript generate image maybe image element how to create an image element dynamically 
using javascript okay so here we go let me   zoom in a little bit so var image document create 
element with image and then you set the image.src   for the source and then you append the element 
you just created to the body let's copy this obviously the source is something else   we want the source to be dyno image so 
we'll just replace that so now we want to create image and maybe instead of var we'll 
use a let um and we're going to use a let   because we want to change the image if you 
use a constant i think it will not change   so let image equals document create 
element img image source set to dyno   image i guess we could also set the alt 
tag for the image can we just do that alt is that and we'll set it to another field from 
the api let's see let's go down to the results   let's find the name of that field for the alt so 
i guess the best thing would be probably the name   so we'll set that to the alt alt text oh i wanna i probably need to 
create a new thing so maybe let um dino alt equals data oh 
actually i think what i need to do is   have this just be the like the item itself and 
then i'll make a new variable for the image url   and then a new variable for the alt text so let 
down it is going to be this but not thumbnail url   it's just going to be the image then we'll say 
let dino image url equals dino image dot thumbnail   then a new one let dino alt 
equals dino image dot name i think um and then we'll just add this here just so 
it'll show up so now i just need to change this   image sources dyno image url image alt 
equals dino alt okay let's see if that worked oops something was wrong maybe name 
this should be the right field um let me let's just comment   out the alt stuff for now just make sure that 
this thing's working with just the image source okay let's try again this is throwing an error i mean it is returning 
the item which is good so script.js um line 27   let's see here why is that get element by id is 
null oh this is a copy code so my body does not   have an idea of body so i'm going to do query 
selector my favorite thing there we go reload   so you notice that when i'm trying to put a 
fix in for something i didn't uncomment the   alt so i just want to change one thing at a 
time and then just keep testing every step   because if you change multiple things and 
it either works or doesn't work then you   don't know exactly what caused it so you kind 
of have to go one by one okay yay okay so now   the image is showing up we're going to add 
back in the image alt text let's try again all right now we'll inspect this   and see yes so the alt text is getting set which 
is great and if we click the button again oh   um the name change so there's two problems here 
it's generating the image every time we click the   button so we need to fix that so the problem 
is here um get dyno image yeah so like we're   generating an image tag every single time and then 
appending it to the body so i think what i want   to do is add some logic so that when you click 
the button it's going to delete images any image   that there is because there's only one image 
on that page and then generate the new one so let's go back to duckduckgo and say javascript 
delete element okay here we go w3 schools so   okay so just remove that seems pretty easy and 
sometimes for the heck of it if i'm not positive   the first result that i look at is correct 
i'll sort of try to check other things um let's try stack overflow so 
there's not many upvotes on this so   it's i'm not sure if the solution is 
going to be great i'm not sure about that maybe es6 syntax since we're doing that nice okay cool because that 
other stack overflow result   it seemed like it was maybe an old way of 
doing things just because one it's eight   years old and then the solution it just kind of 
seemed like it was using some outdated syntax   and i understand it's something that you 
can't like know right off the bat but   i think the whole thing with the parent node 
and whatever just seemed like javascript   has kind of evolved from that point which it 
has when we added you know es6 to the syntax   when we added when we added es6 to the 
search you know it sort of tells you yeah oh that's interesting oh here we go es6 
remove modern post stream of an element is   used to remove method so that seems pretty that 
seems like it's the right thing to do right okay   so what i want to do is when we click the button 
before we create the image i think i need to check   if the image exists so i wonder if i should 
create an id so like image and i'm assuming id   is going to be dino image and then 
i can maybe use this to identify if the image exists or not so let's reload okay 
let's check this okay so the id is set so this   means i can check for document query selector 
dino image and check if what the length is um hmm what undefined so length doesn't work i 
guess maybe because i'm not sure why length   doesn't work let me just let's just check 
for the h1 tags we know that exists h1 length   um so how to what do we want to do 
javascript um check if element exists this is so this is really like 
the real life of a developer trying to do something having it not 
work and then looking something up okay for example if the 
element had an id of find me   it will either return a reference 
to the element or a null oh um let's go back to the site so dyno image so it exists now so it is not null so let's check if it is null it is 
not null let's reload the site so now   oh so now it is null because it doesn't 
exist yet so i guess we can use this   so before we generate the 
new image we're going to say   if document query selector dyno image is not if 
it is not null um which means if the image exists   then we want to delete that image so document 
query oh can i use this keyword this remove   let's see if that works i'm hoping that this 
will refer to whatever is in here i don't   think this is gonna work yeah i don't think 
it's gonna work let's just experiment and see yeah this removes not a function so i think it only works when you're doing 
something with this but that also might   just be my jquery background coming out because 
that's mainly what i worked with in the past   and not even that advanced okay so let's try again   if you click the button hopefully the image will 
just get replaced and there won't be two images   um let's try again oh it did change so maybe 
that one time and replace it with the same one okay that works for me um okay so i think 
we have all the functional stuff working   now that we have the dinosaur name and image 
showing i wanted to go back to the security issue   when it comes with working with api keys so again 
it is extremely important when you're working with   apis to not publicly share your api key so one 
way we're doing that is we are using server side   javascript to actually get all the api data so 
this is better than having it in your client-side   javascript because the browser can literally see 
everything in your client-side javascript and i   could be wrong but i think it's generally not a 
good practice to get api stuff with an api key   in your client-side javascript so that's why it's 
in the server side because the browser can't see   all the code here it only sees what the server 
actually sends to the client and the other thing   we need to be careful about is let's say this 
is this code is going into a github repository   well when we commit our code here it's going 
to have our api key listed here so that's kind   of dangerous too because then if your github 
repository is public and even if it is private   i still wouldn't want to put it in like you don't 
want it in your your git history because you never   know what could happen so what we want to do is we 
want to take this api key out put it in some place   that is not going to be part of your git repo but 
we obviously want to commit our index.js file so   one solution to that is to store the api key value 
itself in what's called an environmental variable   so what that is is it's actually a separate file 
and i'll create it now dot env so this dot emv   file is where we can actually store sensitive 
information like the api key and we can access   it in our server-side javascript but it won't 
be we're not going to include the env file in   our git repo so that way it's kept safe and this 
is something that you only really need for when   you're doing development because you can set the 
environmental variable directly on your production   server if you're deploying this to a server but 
when you're working locally you can use this env   file so the way that we need to use this is we 
actually need to install a package called.env so dot emv is a zero dependency module that 
loads environmental variables from a dot env   file into process.env so this tells you how 
to use it so as early as possible in your   application require and configure env so first 
things first let's install env in our project   so we'll go back to our other 
command line here so npm install   dot enb and we only need this for 
development so we'll say save dev and now in our package package.json 
we see dot env here so that's great   so going back to the website it's a 
requiredconfigure.env so we'll add this   to our code here this is as early as possible 
so i guess i can put at the very top and then create a env file in the root directory which 
we did add environment specific variables   on new lines in the form of name equals value 
okay so we just need one so we're going to do api underscore key equals and then we're 
going to take this api key here copy that   paste it here and that's pretty much it yeah 
there's no semicolons just put everything on   its own line so we'll save this and then now in 
our server side javascript instead of the key we   can use um what was it process.env dot the name of 
the variable so process.enb so wait is this right   i think actually what i might do is since 
we're using this twice i'm going to create a   new variable um i guess i'll just make it here so 
const api key equals pro oops nope process dot env dot api key so now i can just 
use this variable in both places   instead of the actual api key and this is because 
i'm using rapid api and it actually gives you one   api key and you can use multiple apis so it 
kind of makes things a bit easier for you   so this is good and the other thing to remember 
with this.env file is just make sure you add this   to your git ignore file um and don't commit it so 
i think that's everything we need to add actually   let's see so the thing is with dot env as we said 
this is only for development we don't want this   to be used on a production environment 
so we can add um some kind of logic to   let's see don't commit invaded for version 
control i want to like not use dot env if we're   not like in dev um maybe it's 
in the express documentation okay let's go back to the go so i guess node dot env only run only on production   running only oma.env only on 
production maybe condition oh here we go what website is this app dividend okay so if process enb node environment is not 
production then use dot env so i think i can just   use that let's just actually do a search for this 
to see what happens just to find some more sources   how to set node environment to production 
um i don't think that's what i need maybe condition   okay so there's another 
process env.node underscore   equals production so the scene is the same thing 
so i'm guessing this is probably okay to use   let's see where was this 
here we go so i'll copy this   and i guess they'll put it at the top again 
i don't know we'll see if this works or not   if the environment is not production which 
it's not since i'm working locally then   required.env.config all right let's go to website 
click the button uh oh something is not working let's go back to here oh no it 
says i'm not subscribed to the api   what okay i'm not sure what's going on 
let's let's use the hard-coded api key   just to make sure things are working 
oh boy okay let's try this again so that's working so something about 
the way i actually why don't we try um the just take this value 
here and see if that works so somehow it's not getting the right value 
out of here so let's double check the syntax   oh let's um take this out of the   condition just to see if that's the reason 
why okay so condition is not the problem put that back um so i think 
something is wrong with the   oh shoot i put the env file in the public folder 
which is very not right it needs to be in your   web root like the root directory of your 
website okay that's probably why i was not   able to load the environmental variable so if we 
go back here we'll just use this variable again okay reload the website click the button 
okay everything's working everything's fine so slimes love the same image i'm guessing just 
because i'm i'm only getting 10 dinosaurs so   it's just hard to hard to not have 
a repeat sometimes maybe i'll get   more so maybe instead of 10 i'll do 20. 
see if that helps with the randomness all right that's good enough for me 
okay so let's double check our code   make sure everything is secure and saved 
we're not you know publicly showing any   important information so api 
key variable api key variable um yeah and then we're using this 
thing to only run in not production   so i think we are pretty good 
in terms of functionality   so now that we have the sort of javascript side 
all set now we can kind of make this website   look a little cooler than this because this is not 
that cool so let's let's make it look a bit cooler   so first thing i think i'm gonna do is let's get a 
background image on splash and then let's look for rainforests find that what would 
be a good background for dinosaurs   right this might be kind of 
oh this would be cool i think   um i mean it doesn't really matter but this 
is cool but it's uh pretty cool let's try   landscape i sort of like this one 
all right we'll just download it so let's take the file it's one 
megabyte okay that's it's whatever   so we'll just put it up here 
into our public folder so now in our public folder here's the 
image so let's do some styles   so let's set the background 
of the body so background url i'm just doing this to get the name 
of the image but it should just be this oh and i think i can just do 
background like size cover   let's see if that works hmm 
why is the image not showing up body i'm gonna close the console since we 
don't need javascript stuff anymore okay   this is not right i promise i know how 
to do css i just usually use separate   properties but i was just trying to use 
the background um shorthand property all right trust the old mdn let's just 
use background image just to make sure   i have this correct i need the slash all right 
let's try reloading the thing oh there we go   let's try to use the shorthand thing url cover maybe cover needs to go first hmm why is background size not work center contain so i need to do center slash cover   so center center center slash cover oh there 
we go and then i don't want it to repeat um why is it not stretching oh my gosh okay 
first of all let's do no repeat no repeat weird background size is cover which should cover 
everything i don't know this is strange   if i just do center auto okay i guess that worked yeah just center is fine okay so we'll just take this use the background shorthand okay so reel of the page all right 
so it looks fairly jungly i suppose   now let's click the button see how it looks 
looks okay maybe i'll add like a container   for the content in the site just 
so at least for the generator part hmm i'll just make this a section and we'll give it a class of generator so now generator let's make background oh my gosh back ground white and let's also add 
some padding so padding all the way around maybe   just two rims and then you'll just set a default 
color to a really dark gray all right reload   oh boy maybe that was not the right thing 
to do because i kind of like the jungle-y thing okay so this is okay looking see how 
tall oh the body let's say min height 100 v vh and then maybe you also want to sort of 
center everything display flex oh boy   um flex direction column and then 
oh i can do display grid place items center and i think i don't want this height 100b it's 
not these things are sort of centered there we go so let's add these to the body or 
we're not trying to be super fancy here okay i am okay with that well then maybe i should put it into a 
container ugh this is what happens when   you don't work from a design okay so we're 
going to do this stuff here for the generator let's try again now the body i think 
i do want that to be min height 100 bh   all right cool generate dinosaur okay   i am okay with that why is the 
image not getting included here   oh shoot because it was getting appended to the 
body so let's append it to the generator element   that's going to be in i think this script yeah so 
query selector we want to append it to generator there we go so now the image should be 
in the same element as everything else   let's see oh it's class of generator not id so reload click the button yay so now 
this looks better things are centered um   i think maybe i kind of want to center 
this vertically to see what we can do here   so body so let's see body is 100 vh 100 viewport 
height units and then what if i say body is   display flex flex direction column and then that 
would be i think justify content center oh there   we go and maybe we'll just add some space but i 
think that looks all right and then it'll it'd   also be kind of responsive i think so we have to 
fix some css to the image so add this to the body so maybe i like putting the 
alignment stuff at the top okay that's the weird part there is that 
the stuff moves it's maybe not centered yeah we'll just leave things at the 
top i don't need to be too crazy here okay i'm okay with that i 
don't know if we even need this is good to center it why do we have scroll bars here 
oh because of this margin top zero so let's add that to the styles 
as well orange and top zero and then i i will delete this stuff here oh no i want the text line to be stay okay let's add some padding padding of two rims all around so we're getting 
there right and things don't move that much   so one thing we want to do 
is make the image 100 width max width of 100 so now it'll be more 
responsive this is for the dyno image   element so okay i'm okay with that maybe 
we'll also add a little border radius of one rim so cute okay let's make the let's make these 
fonts a bit better some google fonts make   like a kind of a fun looking font or something 
like that so under categories let's do display   because that's where the fun fonts are and we'll 
say dinosaur generator what would be a good font   this one's okay i don't know if there's a caveman 
font or something but something maybe a little bit   more fun oh this one looks pretty good or this 
one this one looks actually let's try this one   it looks sort of i don't know if 
it's a dinosaur theme i suppose let's copy this put it in our html head and 
we'll put it before our actual style.css file   and then now the font family is 
sigmar1 so for h1 we'll say not family   then let's make the default font 
family like just ariel or whatever okay   nice maybe we'll make it a little bigger   font size two rounds line height 
should be one oh nice kinda like that there we go next we want to do is i think 
make the button look a bit better of course   so button element um i think what you want to 
do is border or background blue i'm just sort of   trying to get rid of the default style so border 
none and then padding color white padding one rim   and then two rims horizontal and 
then maybe add a border radius again   maybe less than one room 0.5 rooms okay so 
we'll do something like this but we're going   to change the background color that's not 
blue maybe the button will go first button and what color do we want let's 
pick maybe some kind of green color i think actually they say you should use 
hsl when you can so let's use the hsl   change all the colors hsl cool um let's make the button stand 
out maybe a red color is better purple's okay i think red's good 
so i'll take that go down to button and now it's red nice okay so that looks pretty good so 
now let's add a hover state to the button   and since i'm using css not sas we're 
going to have to do button hover background   and we'll take this but make 
it maybe a little bit darker or here we go darker and we'll 
add a transition background color i think i'll just give you some default timings 
and easings it should just be background i need to add a timing oh i guess i didn't need to add the timing maybe 150 milliseconds and then ease in out there we go and then we also want to make the 
cursor a pointer i believe so it looks like you can click it there you go not bad um they will 
also make it all caps so text transform uppercase okay cool so now i click it 
and let's add some spacing here   so under the button we'll add a margin and add 
another margin under the name let's add two rims oh and maybe we could make it look like a 
label so dino name will say background is white   and then padding 0.5 rams maybe 0.25 grams and 
then on the image we'll make the border radius   only on the the bottom so zero zero one 
ram one room so that's a little bit more   um cohesive and then border radius on the label 
two we'll do one ram one rem zero zero so now it's   like the label type of thing that makes it look 
a bit better okay so this is for the dyno name   oops dino name add these styles 
and oh yeah let's make this hsl   oh i feel like it matters less when 
you're using like um white or black and then dino image and then i guess that's good 
he'll add a little bit more margin bottom foreign seems like it's okay oh oh because this the white thing here is 
because of the label thing so i might actually   need to add logic to generate this thing 
dynamically the same way we did the image   let's see so it's document 
create element so under dino name so const or was it a let let let 
dino div equals um document create   element and i guess div and then dino 
name div dot id equals dino dino name and   we need to add that condition again if it's if 
it exists or not then remove so i'll copy that so if the dyno name thing exists then 
remove it so hopefully this will work oh right because there we go now it shouldn't 
exist yeah so now it doesn't exist   let's open this just to see what 
happens now click the button okay um it didn't generate it it does not exist i'm not even sure if like this is correct let's paste this in the browser i didn't 
see an error so i don't know what's going on oh sorry i want to oh i didn't append it   of course um here we go document 
query selector generator append child oh and i think i need to actually append 
it at the end and instead of document   query selector i'm going to go here and 
hopefully the text content will work and then append child dino name div all right 
now let's see if it will append the name   yay it's a little bit janky because the name 
comes back before the image so it's like   yeah oh geez that's not good so i'll just 
make the label i'm gonna be lazy and just   separate them again yeah let's do that so we're 
just going to under dino name margin bottom   of one rim and then border radius is going 
to be actually let's keep the label square   and then border radius for the image is one room 
okay let's try the end i mean it looks cool but okay it doesn't look great i think when i click 
the button i want to hide all that stuff or maybe just remove it straight out yeah so yeah i'm going to do this so i'm 
going to move the condition things to remove it right when you click the button and i 
think that will help with the jankiness right now   all right let's see if that helps oh much better oh yeah look at that maybe i 
can put back the stuff here okay i'll try to make them the cohesive label 
thing i thought that looked kind of cool it's okay you know what i kind of think 
this is good enough oh yeah that's bad   that's bad the problem is this 
needs to be the same width so   what i actually need to do is make another 
div encompassing the name and the image   i might be overthinking this but i'm 
going to create an empty div here   dino we'll call it dino wrapper so this blank 
thing is where we'll append the label and the image so instead of appending it to the generator 
thing i'm going to append it to dino   wrapper and then we should be able to use css to 
sort of style things better okay so now let's see   we got here so we could do is set a width for dino 
wrapper so we'll say width is maybe 60 percent   i guess the problem is we don't know how 
wide the images are because if it's smaller   i think it just happens to be smaller than the 
let's say with this 50 max width is 400 pixels display block margin auto to center it and i'll maybe add a little media query for this   so dino wrapper and then at a media query 
so media min width of what would a good   desktop or mobile width be maybe 500 ems maybe 
600 yams i think 600 em and then we'll do   we'll make this maybe 80 for mobile and then we 
want to not use pixels but we want to use rams   so 400 divided by 16 is 25 rems this is for 
um responsiveness um i'm sorry this is for   accessibility so that when you zoom in or out 
on the browser it will change and not be stuck   at 400 pixels like this may not be right so 
decent maybe 700 pixels for maybe 600 pixels   600 pixels divided by 16 is 37.5 
ems this is gonna be way too big 37.5 this is just kind of a general thing 
and i think we can just do this okay   let's give it another go not bad maybe we'll do another 
media query for the h1 size so we'll do three rooms for 
desktop and two rams for mobile it is still slightly janky but i think we 
really just wanted to show the logic on this so   i'm okay with it being slightly janky okay so 
we got our dinosaur generator working we're   pulling the data from the api from rapid api and 
then we're generating the name and the image so   one other thing to note and what i will 
probably be doing when this is done is going to refresh my api key so it can't be taken 
from here so what i'm gonna have to do is here it   sort of creates a default application for you 
um maybe you can't see that let's do this so under security this is the api key so this is the 
key that i pasted in my app um but you can add a   new key and you can delete the old key so i'm 
gonna be deleting this one when we're done with   this video but yeah so this is kind of different 
kind of video um the last video i did when i was   doing research on building the dark light toggle 
which i'll link up somewhere here people seem to   like the whole research process so let me know 
what you think down in the comments and yeah",1:24:17

promotion at work and they thought it would be best to live in one of those bouncing neighborhoods Jeff and his brother Luke couldn't complain though a new better house what was not to love as they were getting unpacked one of the neighbors came by hello she said Erin Barbara I live across the street from you well I just wanted to introduce myself and introduce my son she turns around and calls over her son Billy these are our new neighbors Billy said hi and ran back to play in his yard well Sid Jeff's mom I'm Margaret and this is my husband Peter and my two sons joyfully they each introduce themselves and then Barbara invited them to her son's birthday Geoff and his brother were about to object-- when their mother said that they would love to when Jeff and his family had done packing Geoff went up to his mom mom why would you invite us to some kids party if you haven't noticed I'm not some dumb kid Jeff said his mother we've just moved here we should show that we want to spend time with our neighbors now we're going to that party and that's final Jeff started to talk but stopped himself knowing that he couldn't do anything whenever his mum said something it was final he walked up to the room and plopped down in his bed he said they're looking at the ceiling when suddenly he got a weird feeling I'm so much a pain weird feeling he dismissed it as some random feeling he heard his mother called him down to get her stuff and he walked out to get it the next day and Jeff walked downstairs to get breakfast and got ready for school he sat there eating his breakfast and once again and got that feeling this time it was stronger it gave him a slight tugging pain but once again he dismissed it as he only knew finished breakfast they walked down to the bus stop they sat there waiting for the bus and then all of a sudden some kid on a skateboard jumped over them only inches above their laps they both drunk back and surprised hey what the hell the kid landed and turned back to them he kicked his skateboard up and caught it with his hands the kids seemed to be about 12 one year younger than Jeff he wears a narrow Postell shirt and ripped blue jeans well well well it looks like we got some new meat suddenly two other kids appeared one was super skinny and the other was he and the other was huge well since you're new here I'd like to introduce ourselves over there is Keith Jeff Lee you looked over to the skate he had a dopey face he who would expect a sidekick to have and he's Troy they looked over at the fat kid talk about a tub of lard this kid looks like he hasn't exercised since he was crawling this is Inge and I said the first kid am ready now for all the kids in this neighborhood there is a small price for bus fare if you catch my drift Lee you stood up ready to punch the lights out of the kids eyes win one of his friend pulled a knife on him I had hoped you would be more cooperative but it seems we must do this the hard way the kid walked up to you and took his wallet out of his pocket Jeff got that feeling again and now it was truly strong a burning sensation he stood up but Lee you gestured him to sit down Jeff ignored him and walked up to the kid listen here you little punk give that my gross wallet or else Randy put the wallet in his pocket and pulled out his own knife oh and what will you do just as he finished the sentence just get in the nose as Randy reached for his face Jeff grabbed took his wrist and bite Randy screams and Jeff grabbed the knife from his hand Troy and Keith rush Jeff but Jeff was too quickly he threw Randy to the ground Keith left out of him but Jeff ducked and stabbed him in the arm Keith dropped the knife and fell to the ground screaming Troy rushed him too but Jeff didn't even need the knife he just punched Troy's straight in the stomach and Troy went down as he fairly puked all over Lee you could do nothing but look in amazement at Jeff juice how did you that was all he said they saw the bus coming and knew that they'll be blamed for the whole thing was it they started running as fast as they could as they ran they looked back and saw the bus driver rushing over to Randy and the others as Jeff only you made it to school they didn't dare tell what happened all they did was sit and listen leaders thought of that as his brother beating up a few kids but Jeff knew it was more it was something scary as he got that feeling he felt how powerful it was the urge to just someone he didn't like how it sounded but he couldn't help feeling happy he felt that strange feeling go away and stay for the entire day of school we do at home his parents asked him how his day was and he said in a somewhat ominous voice it was a wonderful day next morning he heard a knock at his front door he walked down to find two police officers at the door his mother looking back at him with an angry look these officers tell me that you attacked three kids that it wasn't regular fighting that there was stabbed stabbed son Jeff's gaze fell to the floor showing his mother that it was true mom they were the ones who pulled the knives on me and LU son Sid one of the cops we found three kids two stabbed one having a bruise on his stomach and we have witnesses proving that you fled the scene now what does that tell us Jeff knew it was no use he could say him 'only you had been attacked but did not have no proof that it was not them who attacked first they couldn't say that they weren't fleeing because truth be told they were so Jeff couldn't defend himself all are you son Jeff couldn't do it since it was him who beat up all the kids sir it was me I was the one who beat up the kids Lou tried to hold me back but he couldn't stop me the cop looked at his partner and they both nod well kid

helplessly as the cops bit off with Li you inside a few minutes later Jeff's dad pulled up into the driveway seeing Jeff's face and knowing something was wrong son son what is it Jeff couldn't answer

I think this party could be a good thing that brightens up the past days now kids arrest Jeff's mother walked out of the room and downstairs to get herself ready he picked out a random shirt and pair of jeans and walked downstairs he saw his mother and father all dressed up his mother and dress and his father in a suit he thought why would they ever wear such fancy clothes to a kids party son is that all you're going to wear better than wearing too much he said his mother pushed down the feeling to yell at him and hit it with a smile Jeff grunted and went back up to his room I don't have any fancy clothes he yelled down the stairs just pick out something called his mother he looked around in his closet for what he would call fencing he found a pair of black address pants that he had for special occasions and an underground he couldn't find a shirt to go with it though he looked around and found only a striped pattern fit none of which go with the nice dress pants finally they found a white hoodie and put it on you're wearing that they both said his mother looked at her watch oh no time to change let's just go she said as she heard a Jeff and his father out the door they crossed the street over to Barbara and Billy's house they knocked on the door and at it appeared that Barbara just like his parents way overdressed as they walked inside all Jeff could see were adults no kids the kids are out in the yard Jeff ha ha yoga and Metta mother Sid Barbara Jeff walked outside to a yard full of kids they were running around and weird the cowboy costumes and shooting each other with plastic her guns suddenly a kid came up to him and handed him a toy gun and hand hey what a play he said I know kid I'm Way too old for this stuff the kid looked at him with a weird puppy-dog face wheeze saved the kid fine Sid Jeff he put on a hat and started to pretend to shoot at the kids it might not have been super cool but it was the first time he had done something that took his mind awfully you until he heard a noise a weird rolling noise then it hit him Bren Troy and Keith all jumped over the fence on their skateboards Jeff dropped the fake gun and ripped off the Hat Randy looked at Jeff with a burning hatred hello Jeff is it he said we have some unfinished business Jeff saw his bruised nose I think we're even I beat the crap out of you and you get my brother sent to JDC Randy got an angry look in his eyes oh no I don't go for even I go for winning you may have kicked our asses that one day but not today as he said that Randy rushed Jeff they both fell to the ground where Randy punched him in the nose and Jeff grabbed him by the ears headbutt just push Randy off him and both rose to their feet kids screaming and parents were running out of the house Troy and Keith both guns are the peppermints real ones no one interrupts or guts will fly they said collectively Randy pulled a knife on Jeff and stabbed it into his shoulder [ __ ] screamed and fell to his knees Randy started kicking him in the face after three kicks Jeff grabbed his foot and twisted it causing Randy to fall to the floor Jeff stood up and walked towards the back door Troy grabbed him nades from how he picks up Jeff by the collar and throws him through the patio door as Jeff tries to stand he is kicked down to the ground Randy repeatedly starts kicking Jeff until he starts to cough up blood come on Jeff fight me he picks up Jeff and throws him into the kitchen Randy sees a bottle of vodka on the counter and smashes the glass over Jeff's head fight he threw his chair back into the living room come on Jeff look at me Jeff glances off his face riddled with blood I was the one who got your brother sent to JDC and now you're just gonna sit here and let him rot in there for a whole year you should be ashamed Jeff started to get up Oh finally you stand up and fight Jeff is now to his feet blood and vodka on his face once again he gets that strange feeling the one in which he hasn't felt for a while finally he's up says Randi as he runs a gift that's when it happens something inside Jeff snaps his psyche is destroyed and all rational thinking is gone all he can do is kill kill kill he grabs Randy's pile drives him to the ground he gets on top of him and punches him straight in the heart the punch causes Randy's heart to stop as Randy gasps for breath and dies everyone is looking at Jeff now the parents the crying kids even Troy and Keith although they easily break from their gaze and pointed their guns after Jeff Jeff sees the guns trained on him and her runs for the stairs as he runs Troy and Keith let out fire on him each shot in history Jeff runs up the stairs he hears Troy and Keith follow up behind as they live out their final rounds of bullets Jeff ducks into the bathroom he grabs the towel rack and rips it off the wall Troy and Keith racin knives ready Troy swings his knife at Jeff who backs away and bangs the towel rack into Troy's face Troy goes down hard and now all this left is Keith he's more agile and Troy though and ducks when Jeff swings the towel rack he dropped the knife and grabbed drift by the neck head he pushed him into a wall a thing of bleach fell down on top of from the top shelf it burned both of them and they started to scream Jeff wiped his eyes as best he could he pulled back the towel rack and swung it straight into Keith's head as they lay there bleeding to death he let out an ominous smile what's so funny asked Jeff Keith pulled out a light and switched it on what's funny he said is that you're covered in Bleach now go the Jeff's eyes widened as Keith threw the lighter at him as soon as the flame made contact with him the flames ignited the alcohol vodka while the alcohol burned him the bleach bleached his skin get it Jeff Lee now that terrible screech as he caught on fire he tried to roll out the fire but it was no use the alcohol had made him into a walking inferno he ran down the hall and fell down the stairs everybody started screaming as they saw Jeff now a man on fire dropped to the ground nearly dead the last thing Jeff saw was his mother and the other parents trying to extinguish the flame that's when he passed out when Jeff work he had a cast wrapped around his face he couldn't see anything but he felt a cast on his shoulder and stitches all over his body he tried to stand up but he realized that there was some tube in his arm and when he tried to get up it fell out and a nurse rushed him okay six in her school I don't think you can get out of bed just yet she said as she put him back in bed and reinserted the tube Jeff sat there with no vision no idea of what his surroundings were finally after hours he heard his mother she asked Jeff couldn't answer though his face was covered and he was unable to speak oh honey I have great news after all the witnesses told the police that Randy confessed to trying to attack you they decided to let Li you go this made Jeff almost bolt up stopping halfway remembering the tube coming out of his arm bless that tube he'll be out by tomorrow and then the two of you will be able to be together again Jeff's mother hugs chip [ __ ] forward how about his mother hugged him Jeff's mother hugs chip pin says her goodbyes to Jeff the next couple of weeks were those where Jeff was visited by his family which is to say Jeff's family they came to the day where his bandages were to be removed his family were all there to see it what he would look like as the doctors unwrapped the bandages from Jeff's face everyone was on the edge of their seats they waited until the last bandage holding the cover over his face was almost removed let's hope for the best Sid the doctor he quickly pulls the cloth letting the rest fall from Jeff's face Jeff's mother screams at the sight of his [Music] Lewin chefs dad stare awestruck at his face what what happened to my face Jeff SID he rushed out of bed and ran to the bathroom he looked in the mirror and saw the cause of the distress his face it it's horrible his lips would burn to a deep shade of red his face was turned to a pure white color and his hair soon come brown to black that's no thing he slowly put his hand to his face it had a sort of leathery feel to it now he looked back at his family then back at the mirror Jeff sadly you it's not that bad not that bad Sid Jeff it's perfect his family were equally surprised Jeff started laughing uncontrollably his parents noticed that his left eye and hand were twitching Oh Jeff you okay okay I've never felt more happy hahaha look at me this face goes perfectly with me he stroked his face feeling it looking at it in the mirror what caused all this well you may recall that when Jeff was fighting Randy something in his mind is sanity specifically snapped now he was left as a crazy killing machine however his parents didn't know that dr. Sid Jeff's mum is my son all right you know in the hid oh yes this behavior is typical for patients that have taken very large amounts of painkillers if his behavior doesn't change in a few weeks bring him back here and we will give him a psychological test Jeff's mother went over to Jeff Jeff sweetie it's time to go Jeff looks away from the mirror his face still formed into a kind of crazy smile kay mommy ha ha ha ha his mother took him by the shoulder and took him to get his clothes this is what came in said the lady of the desk Jeff's mom looked down to see the black dress pants and white hoodie her son wore now they were clean of blood and stitched together they took the clothes they got been in the [ __ ] fire and cleaned them of all the blood and vodka and bleach and didn't cut out the burn beds and Stinson's [ __ ] sake Jeff's mother led him into a room and made him put his clothes on then they left not knowing that this was their final day of life done done later that night Jeff's mother woke to a sound coming from the bathroom it sounded as if someone was crying she slowly walked over to see what it was when she looked into the bathroom she saw a horrendous sight Jeff had taken a knife and carved a smile into his cheeks Jeff what are you doing asked his mother Jeff looked over to his mother I couldn't keep smiling mommy it hurt after a while now I can smile forever Jeff's mother noticed his eyes ring didn't black Jeff eyes his eyes was seemingly never closing I couldn't see my face I got tired and my eyes started to close I burnt out the eyelid so I could forever see myself my new face Jeff's mother slowly started to back away seeing that her son was going bananas What's Wrong mommy aren't I beautiful yes she said yes you are let me go she ran into the room and shook Jeff's dad from his sleep Hadi get the guns she stopped as she saw Jeff in the doorway holding knife mommy you lied that's the last thing they hear as Jeff rushes them with the knife gutting both of them his brother Lee you woke up startled by some noise he didn't hear anything else so he just shut his eyes and tried to go back to sleep but as he was on the border of slumber he got the strangest feeling that someone was watching him he looked up before Jeff's hand covered his mouth he slowly raised the knife ready to plunge it into the you loo you've thrashed hair and they're trying to escape Jeff's grip just go to sleep to be continued no probably not,27:47

views,Informative,"have you ever thought about sailing the open sea alone would you ever want to for many of us it might sound like fun exciting or simply relaxing to take some time away from our day-to-day lives like enjoying a nice vacation perhaps picturing yourself on a boat with beautiful sunshine and salty sea air is appealing to you either that or maybe just the idea makes you seasick whatever your case may be most of us can probably agree that sailing is one thing but being stranded out in the open ocean alone is far less than ideal should anything like this happen to you your chances of survival are slim no one knows this better than a man who has experienced it firsthand in 1981 after enduring a divorce from his wife Steven callahan was driven by ambition and an adventurous spirit he decided that he wanted to sail the treacherous Atlantic Ocean in his 21 foot boat called a Napoleon solo a fitting name given his desire to undertake the voyage entirely by himself at first his trip was going smoothly he began his long journey from Newport Rhode Island first sailing to Bermuda from there he set sail to England he continued onward eventually making his way to the Caribbean island of Antigua from there his boat suffered heavy damage from some bad weather luckily though he managed to make the necessary repairs and move forward with his grand trip he persisted on through Spain in Portugal coming out near Madeira in the Canary Islands it was when he departed the Canary Islands on his way back to Antigua when disaster struck in January 1982 just a week after his departure the Napoleon solo was stricken presumably by a whale this caused severe damage and Callahan was forced to abandon his boat with no time to think he frantically prepared his lifeboat while simultaneously trying to gather as many supplies as he could he had to die for repeatedly back into his sinking boat to retrieve vital items for survival this was made all the more difficult considering that he couldn't see anything while under the water and had to navigate his boat by memory he had no choice but to locate items by feeling around for them imagine for a moment having to race against the clock to pack whatever you can for survival knowing full well that what you choose to grab could mean the difference between life and death now also imagine that you're forced to do this while blindfolded anyone would probably feel the need to panic scenario your adrenaline would surely be pumping your heart racing out of your chest yet if you want to survive you don't have time to give in to trepidation that's probably how Callahan felt during his moment of sheer crisis in his haste Callahan managed to procure a fishing line water purifier and spear gun for food he gathered mostly scraps like peanuts and raisins eggs cabbage corned beef baked beans in 8 ounces of water with what he was able to grab however his supplies would only last him about two and a half weeks from then on he was without much of anything 800 miles west of the Canaries completely isolated and adrift on a raft in the middle of the open ocean surely he should have been doomed by this point he had only as wits to rely upon with very few resources available to him he had to develop a means to survive he mostly fished and occasionally hunted for birds he had no way to cook his food however so he had to eat everything raw consider that the next time you feel the need to complain about your food being overcooked for Callahan during his desperate time over cooked meals would have been a luxury though he had grabbed a water purifier it turned out to be ineffective at converting seawater so he had to rig a system of balloons and tarps to catch rainwater with this he was only able to secure about 20 ounces of water per day but this was just barely enough to keep him alive Callahan was forced to revert to old-fashioned navigational techniques creating a Sexton out of pencils a Sexton is a device used to measure the horizon and celestial objects like stars and planets he used this tool in order to roughly estimate where he was and where to steer his raft he used the North Star as his guide to aim his raft toward the West Indies hoping to run in to help along the way after so many weeks adrift at sea Callahan's raft became its own miniature ecosystem a colony of barnacles began to grow on the bottom of it which attracted fish that he would then catch and eat unfortunately these fish also attracted sharks that would continuously circle his raft they served as a constant reminder of the dangerous situation he was in one might presume that one of the Sharks would have grown impatient and taken a bite out of callaghan's raft to deflate it but no it was actually a fish that almost sank him while he was fishing one day his catch ripped a hole through the bottom of his rack Callahan had to form rushed repairs with his arms under the water and an encompassing circle of sharks surrounding him keeping his boat afloat while simultaneously trying to repair it was a full-time job it must have been exhausting throughout the entirety of his ordeal around seven ships passed within his vicinity two of them were less than a mile away Callahan desperately tried to signal them using a flare gun and emergency radio beacon to gain their attention but his attempts ended in failure he felt utterly helpless and became increasingly depressed though his raft was raided a six-man inflatable it still felt cramped after a while on top of everything he endured fierce storms battled huge waves and fought against extreme loneliness with each passing day his chances of survival were also growing more and more bleak on the morning of his 76th day adrift a group of fishermen spotted him just off the southeastern coast of Guadalupe finally he was rescued by this point though Callahan had lost 40 pounds and was covered in painful open sores from his constant exposure to the Sun in seawater one might think that after enduring all this Callahan would have succumbed to post-traumatic stress disorder and wished to remain silent on his frightening experience but this was not the case Callahan recounted his days at sea in his book adrift 76 days lost at sea which was on the New York Times bestseller list in 1986 for more than 36 weeks his memoir was also used in the television documentary series I shouldn't be alive which aired on November 17th 2010 about 29 years after he was rescued in the Caribbean his ordeal made him somewhat of an expert on ocean survival and so he was contacted to act as an adviser for the 2012 film Life of Pi which if you don't already know is about a young boy trapped on a raft in the middle of the ocean with a tiger Callahan made props for the film including the lures and other tools seen in the movie he mentioned that the film was so realistic that he found it difficult to watch thankfully though Callahan didn't have to deal with the added threat of a tiger on top of everything else he endured during his experience after recovering from his living nightmare at sea Callahan also decided to use the knowledge of what he had learned to help develop a design for an improved life raft he called the design the clam and created it as a utility raft equipped with a canopy to shield from prolonged exposure to the Sun as well as to use for collecting rainwater he did this so that if others somehow wound up in the same dangerous situation they'd at least have an easier time through the ordeal than he did as an author naval architect inventor and sailor Steven Callahan is an interesting person to say the least with everything set against him on his 76th day venture alone at sea he survived using his ingenuity and determination usually waking up because he had to go to the bathroom is annoying but on May 26 2013 waking up and leaving his bunk to use the bathroom was a decision that saved 29 year-old Harrison or giba or Kenny's life through an odd twist of fate Harrison ended up being the lone survivor of a boat sinking at sea he can lay claim to a unique title he's the only person in the world who have survived on the sea floor for nearly three days the Gulf of Guinea in the southeast Atlantic Ocean is rich with petroleum Laden layers of sedimentary seabed many offshore oil rig drilling operations dot the African coast here on May 26th about 20 miles off of a scrub us Nigeria in choppy seas three tugboats pitched in yacht as they performed tension tow functions on a chevron oil tanker filling up at single buoy mooring number three just before 5:00 a.m. the tugboat jasc on four was caught by a large rogue wave and capsized because of ongoing piracy problems in the Gulf security protocol on the tugboat was that the 12-man crew would lock themselves in their room when sleeping unfortunately this rule slowed down the jasc enforced crew when they tried to escape the crew members had to first scramble out of their cabins that is except for the vessels cook Harrison who had got enough to use the bathroom in his underwear when the tugboat keeled over and the ocean rushed in Harrison had to force the bathrooms metal door open against the wall of water the pressure of the water was extremely strong and Harrison was unable to follow some of his colleagues to the emergency hatch he watched in horror as a surge overwhelmed three crew members and swept him out of the boat into the raging sea then the water pushed Harrison down a narrow hallway into another bathroom which had joined an officer's cabin dazed and bruised but miraculously still alive Harrison held on to an overturned wash basin to keep his head above water in the four foot square bathroom the boat sank nearly 100 feet eventually coming to rest upside down on the sea bed when the tug boat capsized there was an immediate rescue operation launched with the other boats in the area and a helicopter a diving crew quickly located the wreck and marked the location with buoys they banged on the hull Harrison hammered back but they didn't hear him as the divers weren't prepared for deep diving they could only stay at the depth of the rack for a limited period of time the rescue was called off due to no evidence of survivors after nearly a day of being in the bathroom Harrison got up the courage to leave his little air pocket in pitch darkness he swam and felt his way into the engineers office miraculously there was another air pocket here two of about four feet high in Harrison's estimation having solved the immediate problem of having air to breathe Harrison could focus on other concerns the first one being that he was cold in May the surface temperature of the East Atlantic on average is a pleasant eighty one point nine degrees Fahrenheit but Harrison was 100 feet down shivering wet and wearing only boxer shorts Harrison faced hypothermia or his body losing heat faster than he could produce it cautiously Harrison felt his way around the cabin he found some tools and used them to strip off wall paneling with a mattress and the material from the wall he was able to make a platform to sit on this platform helped Harrison to stay afloat and lifted the upper half of his body out of the water allowing him to reduce heat loss hungry thirsty cold and stuck in complete darkness Harrison was terrifying he tried to think about his family quite religious whenever he felt especially scared Harrison would pray and call on Jesus to rescue him over time the sea water began to remove the skin from Harrison's tongue he could smell something rotting he thought it was the decomposing bodies of his former shipmates every small sound in the dark was magnified the creaking of the hall the banging of the wreckage against the walls and most horrific alee splashing and eating noises as fishes nibbled at corpses meanwhile a dive support vessel the Lueck toucan arrived to the area of the sinking the parent company of the jasc on 4 West African ventures had hired a deep-sea salvage saturation diving team from subsea services company DC and global to retrieve the bodies of the Lost crew members the six divers deck crew and technical staff of the Lueck tucán knew it was going to be a grueling mission aside from the heart-rending work of recovering the dead the boat had sunk upside down into soft mud stirring up fine silt and creating extremely poor visibility furthermore because of the security protocols the boat was latched from the inside dive team to consisted of Niko van Heerden Andrzej Erasmus and Daryl you Stacy with supervisor Colby we're topside on the ship helping to guide the die via a connected microphone while watching the dive through a camera worn by Nikko the team spent over an hour breaking through an external watertight door and then a second metal door to get into the sunken boat once inside it was extremely disorienting with the ceiling being on the bottom and the floor of her head the murky water was filled with all sorts of hazards including furniture and equipment slowly painstakingly the divers explored the boat they'd recovered four corpses when Nikko crawled up the stairs to the main deck it was a tight squeeze with the diving gear on his back he was in a small passageway getting his bearings when something suddenly reached out of the murk and touched him Harrison had nearly given up hope when he heard a noise that sounded like an anchor dropping then eventually he heard hammering on the hull of the boat he knew it had to be divers he banged on the wall but didn't think they heard him then Harrison saw the light from one of the divers head torches as he swam through the hallway past the far end of the cabin unfortunately the diver was too quick and left the area before Harrison could reach him but then came the magical moment you may have seen the surreal amazing rescue footage from Niko's video when he sees what he believes is another dead body he touches the corpses hand in the hand unexpectedly squeezes his Nico has a momentary freakout as his supervisor Colby shouts through the microphone he's alive he's alive Colby then tells Nico to comfort Harrison by patting him on the shoulder and giving him a thumbs up sign the divers were amazed to find Harrison alive the maximum depth for recreational diving is 130 feet generally recreational divers don't stay at 100 feet for more than 20 minutes in terms of the air pocket the divers had reached Harrison just in time a human inhales roughly 350 cubic feet of air every 24 hours however because the boat was under pressure on the ocean floor scientists estimate that Harrison's air pocket had been compressed by a factor of about four if the pressurized air pocket were about two hundred sixteen cubic feet it would contain enough oxygen to keep Harrison alive for about two and a half days when Harrison was located he had been underwater for about 60 hours an additional danger came from the carbon monoxide or co2 build-up co2 is fatal to humans at a concentration of about 5% as Harrison breathed he exhaled carbon dioxide slowly increasing the levels of the gas in the nice face however co2 is absorbed by water and by splashing the water inside his air pocket Harrison inadvertently increased the water surface area thereby heightening the absorption of co2 and helping to keep the gas below the lethal 5% level the divers described Harrison is having co2 poisoning being short of breath and delirious when they found him he wouldn't have lasted much longer the divers first used hot water to warm Harrison up then fitted him with an oxygen mask meanwhile on the surface the dive support crew was in contact with medical and diving experts discussing how to best help the survivor Harrison had a new problem what divers commonly called the bends the bends also known as decompression sickness or caisson disease occurs when nitrogen bubbles form in the blood as a result of changes in pressure if Harrison ascended directly from 100 feet underwater to the surface of the ocean the bubbles in his blood would cause in the best case joint pain and rashes to the worst case paralysis neurological issues cardiac arrest or possibly even death it was decided that Harrison would be treated as if he were one of the saturation divers coming up after a dive Harrison spent about 20 minutes getting used to breathing through the mask then the divers put a diving helmet and harness onto him they were a little worried that he would panic as they got him out of the boat and would be a danger to the dive but Harrison continued to be cool under pressure the team was impressed with his level demeanor Harrison was taken from the boat and led to a diving bell which took him to the surface he finally arrived topside at around 7 p.m. on Tuesday the 28th of May disoriented Harrison thought that it was Sunday evening and that he had only been trapped for 12 hours he was shocked to learn that he'd been underwater for over two days from the diving bell Harrison was moved to a decompression chamber where he stayed for another two and a half days while his body decompressed a surface pressure of the 12 crew members on board the tugboat Jass count for divers rescued one survivor and recovered 10 of the bodies the search for the 11th crew member had to be called off due to dangerous conditions Harrison made a full recovery from his ordeal and returned to his hometown of wory Nigeria he didn't go to the funerals of his colleagues because he feared their family's reactions Nigerians can be very religious but are also superstitious some rumors spread that Harrison saved himself through black magic Harrison was also plagued with survivor's guilt wondering why he was the only one to live since the incident Harrison's experienced PTSD his wife act Pavano kena says he suffers nightmares Harrison will suddenly awake screaming and flailing convinced that he's underwater Harrison has since taken a cooking job on dry land and vows to never again take a position on a boat he made a pact with God when he was at the bottom of the ocean when I was under the water I told God if you rescue me I will never go back to the sea again never she was exhausted but she needed to keep moving her head throbbed with hunger every part of her body ached she was covered in mosquito bites and had second-degree sunburns her wristwatch stopped long ago but she tried to estimate how many days it had been since she had fallen from the sky at twilight she heard voices and thought that she was imagining things again but then three men walked out of the rainforest and were stunned to see her I'm a girl who was in the lancet crash she told them my name is Julianna born to German zoologist parents Maria and Hans Wilhelm on October 10th 1954 Julianna koepka had an interesting childhood her parents worked for the Museum of Natural History in Lima Peru when Julianna was 14 her parents decided to leave the city and sent up pen Guana ecological research station in the Amazon rainforest for the next two years Julianna was homeschooled and accompanied her parents on research trips into the jungle where she learned plant animal and insect identification and in various survival techniques along the way educational authorities disapproved and Juliana was forced to return to Lima to finish high school in December of 1971 Maria came to the city to collect seventeen-year-old Julianna the plan being to visit her father for Christmas although her mother wanted to leave sooner on the 20th Juliana had a school dance on December 22nd and a graduation ceremony on the 23rd after pleas from Juliana her mom agreed to fly out on Christmas Eve unfortunately all the flights were booked aside from one with Elena's Idris national associate adenomas Lanza the airline had a poor safety record in Hans Wilhelm had previously urged Maria to avoid flying with the company but Giuliana's mother thought they'd be fine just before noon on December 24th Lanza domestic passenger flight 508 departed Leamas Jorge Chavez International Airport bound for Iquitos Peru with a scheduled stop at Buca Peru the first half of the 70 minute 304 mile flight to Pucallpa was normal then the lockheed l-188 a Elektro turboprop aircraft which was travelling at around 21,000 feet flew into a thunderstorm a later investigation determined that the crew feeling pressure to meet the holiday schedule decided to continue the flight despite the treacherous whether ahead as the plane dipped in heat due to turbulence luggage and Christmas presents fell from the overhead lockers scared passengers screamed and wept suddenly there was a bright flash as a lightning strike ignited the fuel tank in the right wing blowing a hole into the plane Giuliana remembers Maria saying that's the end it's all over those were the last words she ever heard her mother speak the plane disintegrated about two miles above the ground Giuliana still strapped into her airplane seat spun head over heels the wind whistling in her ears she lost consciousness only to regain it and lose it again as she free fell to the ground sometime later Giuliana came into the rain forests wet muddy and alone she huddled under her airplane seat fading in and out of consciousness for the next 19 or so hours throughout the rest of the day and the night the next morning Giuliana took stock of herself her neck shoulder and ankle hurt she had a large gash on her arm and her right eye was swollen shut she wore a very short sleeveless mini dress and one white sandal aside from the swelling she was nearsighted and had lost her glasses however her watch still worked and she knew it was around 9:00 a.m. Maria's airplane seat had landed next to her daughters but it was empty dizzy Juliana crawled on all fours and searched the area around her crash site she marked trees to keep her bearings and called for her mother hearing nothing except the sounds of the rain forest she felt scared and helpless after some time Julianna forced herself to stand at first she was wobbly but gradually grew steady on her feet thirsty she drank rain drops off of leaves she heard planes overhead searching for the wreck but due to the dense tree canopy couldn't see them she realized that she needed to get somewhere wide-open where she could be seen by rescuers Juliana headed off into the rain forest as she walked she tested the area in front of her by throwing her remaining shoe ahead then moving forward to pick it up and tossing it again snakes could be camouflaged as dry leaves and she didn't want to step on one or any other creature the only sign of the crash Juliana found was a bag of candy which she promptly ate saving a few pieces for later the Trek was rough going with uneven terrain she frequently had to climb over or squeeze under huge logs that blocked her way eventually Juliana found a small Creek and followed it having been taught that following water leads to rivers which often means civilization in people over the next day or so Juliana stumbled through the rainforest following the water as it slowly grew from a trickle to a stream other than candy and water she didn't have anything else to eat since this was the rainy season there was no fruit for her to pick she didn't have any tools to help her cut trees catch fish or cook roots also she was aware that many of the plants that grew in the jungle were poisonous the days were sweltering humid and it frequently rained at night the temperature dropped Juliana cowered under bushes curled up shivering and her mini dress she was constantly attacked by insects especially mosquitoes flies laid eggs in the wound on Giuliana's arm she squeezed it but wasn't able to get them out she worried that she'd lose her arm as she walked downstream Juliana saw more evidence of the plane crash she heard the call of a king vulture and suspected that there were dead bodies nearby eventually she came across a row of seats with three dead people still strapped in the passengers had a head first impact and hit the ground so hard that they were buried almost two feet into the dirt Juliana was horrified judging by their clothing two of the victims were men to make sure that the woman was not her mother Juliana took a stick and knocked off a shoe of the female corpse since the toes were painted she knew it could not have been Maria since her mother never used nail polish on December 28th Juliana swatch finally stopped after that she tried to count off the days but suffered from confusion on the fifth or sixth day of her journey Juliana heard a sound that gave her hope it was the call of Watson a subtropical bird that nests solely near open stretches of water figuring that people would be settled by the water Juliana found the sound picking up her pace finally Juliana made her way to the bank of a large river but there were no humans or settlement in sight periodically she heard the sound of planes in the distance but less and less as the days passed she despaired believing that the searchers had given up having rescued all the passengers except for her the densely overgrown riverbanks made it hard for Juliana to continue on land she began to carefully wade through shallow water keeping a lookout for stingrays because it was slow going Juliana tried to swim in the middle of the river knowing that stingrays won't venture into deep water however she still had piranhas and Caymans to worry about and night she huddled on the riverbank restlessly dozing her various injuries pulsating with pain her cuts and scrapes infected days ago Juliana had eaten the last piece of her candy now she drank river water to keep her stomach full one morning she felt a sharp pain in her back when she gingerly explored the area her hand came away bloody the Sun had severely burned her back as she swam and exhausted and starving Juliana was plagued with hallucinations of civilization sometimes she saw the roof of a house or heard chickens clucking she endlessly fantasized about food each day it got harder to get into the cold water and swim on the tenth day of Juliana's arduous journey she constantly encountered logs as she drifted downriver she weakly climbed over them using the last of her strength trying not to injure herself further after an exhausting day Juliana swam to ashore where she dozed off on a gravel bank minutes later she awoke to an amazing sight a boat Juliana wanted to leave but she didn't want to steal the boat instead she took a small path that led up the bank from the river because she was so weak it took her hours to make it up the hill to a tiny hut with a palm leaf roof at the hut Julia found a liter of gasoline she poured some on her wounds remembering having seen her father do the same to cure a dog of worms the gasoline stung but drew out a mass of maggots that were infecting her arm a second path led from the hut into the rain forest Juliana waited but no one showed up so she spent the night at the shack the ground was too hard so she went back into the water and laid down in the sand the next day Juliana walked up to the hut again because it was pouring rain there were frogs everywhere and Juliana tried to catch one to eat thankfully she was too slow which was good because the frogs ended up being poisonous Juliana stayed at the shelter telling herself that she dressed one more day before moving on near evening she heard voices and thought it was her imagination but then three Lumberjacks came out of the forest they froze in shock when they saw her Juliana recalls that they thought she was a kind of water goddess called Vega Mangia a figure from a local legend who is a hybrid of a water dolphin and a blonde white skinned woman in Spanish Juliana explained what happened the woodcutters treated her wounds and gave her food the next morning they loaded her into a canoe for a seven-hour ride downriver to a lumber station from there a local pilot flew her to a hospital in Pucallpa Juliana learned that her collarbone was actually broken she had torn an ACL and partially fractured her shin the day after arriving at the hospital Juliana was reunited with her father she described their emotional reunion as a moment without words Juliana was interviewed by the air force and police with her direction search parties located the crash site in the bodies of the victims in total the Lance of flight 508 crash killed 91 people six crew members and 85 of it's 86 passengers it was discovered that as many as 14 passengers including Giuliana's mother Maria survived the crash but perished due to their injuries before they could be found Juliana was hailed as the miracle girl in the Peruvian press she received hundreds of letters from all over the world touched by her tale of survival she and her father moved to Germany or Juliana made a full recovery though plagued by nightmares grief over her mother's death and haunted by survivor's guilt Juliana excelled at college studying zoology like her parents and got a PhD in 2000 famed director vana Hertzog made a documentary about Giuliana's ordeal he actually located the crash site and filmed Juliana retracing some of her steps in 2011 Juliana published an autobiography today Juliana now in her 60s is a librarian at the Bavarian State collection of zoology in Germany and frequently visits Pan Guana the Peruvian research facility started by her parents the date is May 23rd in 1939 and several hundred feet below the Atlantic waves just off the east coast of the United States a group of submarine errs and their captain huddled together in the freezing darkness their submarine has gone down rear compartments flooding and causing the crippled sub to settle on the mud at the bottom of the sea a rescue buoy with the telephone line was released hours ago and yet still no contact has been established with the outside world as far as the men are aware nobody even knows they've gone under and every minute that goes by the air supply dwindles and the odds of rescue grow even slimmer suddenly though in the pitch dark there's the ringing of the emergency telephone rigged too directly via hardline to the rescue buoy up top captain Oliver ethnic wind picks up the receiver and as he utters a greeting the line goes dead of Thapa sea swell has severed the telephone line leaving the trapped crew cut off from the world and with no idea if rescue will ever come between 1921 and 1938 825 sailors across 18 submarines from various countries all died beneath the waves the reputation of submarines was so poor that in the US sailors called it the coffin service insurance policies specifically dictated that they would not be paid out if the recipient died in a submarine accident these underwater tools of war were by far the most dangerous ever created and yet as World War One had proven they could turn traditional naval power on its head during the first world war Britain operated the world's most formidable Navy and kept the German Navy boxed in on their home ports for the vast majority of the war yet German submarines routinely slipped past Royal Navy ships to decimate shipping on the Atlantic to the point that Britain's economy was put in dire jeopardy despite their dangers navies around the world knew that the submarine was a vital tool of underwater warfare and those that chose to ignore the use of subs did so only at great peril a state-of-the-art ship at her time the squalus was launched on the 14th of September 1938 just two months behind her sister ship she would be officially commissioned of March 1st 1939 and underwent sea trials during the following months the state-of-the-art ship was captain Oliver F naquin who had headed a crew of five officers and 51 enlisted men he was known as a stern commander exactly the type of man you wanted in control of a ship where the smallest mistake could cost everyone on board their lives as a diesel-powered submarine the squalus would loiter at the surface long enough to charge her great banks of batteries with her diesel engines however once the batteries were charged the ship would dive beneath the waves to avoid detection one of the most advanced subs in the world the squalus could dive up to 250 feet and could travel up to 11,000 miles without refueling on the morning of the 23rd of May the squalus once more put out for routine diving tests moving 13 miles southeast of Portsmouth aboard that day were two Navy Yard engineers and a General Motors representative who were all there to evaluate the squalus ability to dive at high speed within 60 seconds exactly if she would have to do during wartime to avoid enemy planes on the bridge the captain orders the dive to begin in the comms officers radio the subs location back to Portsmouth as the diving Klaxons begin to sound moving at 16 knots the squalus begins to sink beneath the waves and in the control room the alarm board also known as the Christmas tree shows green lights across the board indicating that all hull openings were closed these openings included not just the main hatch in ballast tanks but also induction pipes situated behind the conning tower which fed air into the giant diesel engines and ventilated the boat getting red of the diesel exhaust in order for the dive to be successful the submarine had to quickly shut down the diesel engines closed the induction pipes and turn on the battery powered electric motors the dive seems to be perfect ended minutes the squalus is already 20 feet below the waves suddenly captain Naquin notices his ears pop from a fluctuation in air pressure and simultaneously a frantic plea comes over the ship's intercom from the engine room take her up the inductions open the Christmas tree shows green lights across the board yet over the intercom the chief engineer is screaming for the boat to surface and the roar of water can be heard in the background inside the engine room seawater is flooding through the induction pipes and quickly filling the compartment as men struggle to hang on and their way to the main henge a sudden rush of air signals the ballast tanks being blown in an attempt to lift the drowning some and for a moment it looks as if it'll work the subs descent stops and the ship's shutters in place but then begins sinking again suddenly the stern plunges backward at a 45-degree angle sending sailors tumbling backwards into the freezing water those that had made it to the engine rooms hatch are thrown back and away on the bridge captain Naquin hangs onto the periscope as the sub tilts dramatically backwards he makes a very hard decision and immediately orders that all hatches be sealed this will trap men in the flooded compartments but maybe the only way to save the ship electrician's mate third-class alloyed Manus is at his post between the control room and the flooding rear compartments trying to shove close the 200-pound door but the steep angle is making it almost impossible suddenly he hears shouts from the compartments behind him men screaming for him to hold the door open but Manus grunts with effort and slams the door shut trapping the men behind it with water already reaching the control room it is the only choice to make even if he has just doomed all the men behind that door to death in the torpedo room at the tail of the sub seventeen men try in vain to seal themselves in but the rising seawater makes it impossible for them to seal their hatch in the engine room a sailor has reached one of the escape hatches and unlocked it but the pressure of the ocean outside keeps it sealed shut and gives no chance for escape ahead of the sealed door keeping the rest of the sub from sinking the forward battery room suddenly experiences a rapid voltage drain chief electrician's made the Lawrence gainer realizes that the batteries have been exposed to seawater and an explosion is imminent as the power flickers off he takes a flashlight and lowers himself down into the narrow crawl space underneath the main deck crawling forward in several inches of water toward the giant battery banks a single straight arc of electricity would instantly fry him yet the Sailor continues on reaching the bank of batteries he disengages one of the two large disconnect switches and suddenly a miniature lightning storm erupts right before his eyes a cascade of blue-white electricity sizzles and melts the insulation on the hall in half blinds the Sailor reaching through the arcing electricity to the second switch he disengages the second switch cutting the flow of electricity altogether and avoiding an explosion his actions will ensure that the sailors have a hope of rescue even if it's cost him part of his vision the submarine continues its slow descent into the depths of the Atlantic in the dark the survivors fear that the ship will implode at any second and the hall groans and creaks as it takes on the weight of the ocean above it rated to a crush depth of 250 feet the crew doesn't know just how far down this part of the ocean stretches and while they're still on the continental shelf they could hit a depth of up to 400 feet implosion would kill them all in an instant underwater recordings of implosion events confirmed that it occurs so quickly the human brain does not have the time to register it happening a small mercy for any doomed Submariner suddenly though the crew is thrown to the floor as the sub hits the muddy floor below settling 240 feet below the Atlantic the 33 survivors take stock of their situation they have approximately 48 hours of air and enough Momsen lungs for every survivor the lungs are breathing devices designed to allow the crew to float to the surface but they've only been tested to a depth of 200 feet and even if they worked properly the crew could die from the bends swimming to the surface would be a last desperate result a rescue buoy has been dispatched with signaling Rockets being fired off automatically at a periodic rate a telephone line attached to the buoy will allow the crew to speak with any would-be rescuers in the dark the men wonder if there are survivors in any of the other compartments they tap on air lines that lead from one end of the ship to the other but there's no response many hours later the crew can hear the sound of propellers overhead and spirits or another submarine has discovered their location a few minutes later the phone rings but almost as soon as captain Naquin replies an ocean swells snaps the taut telephone cable the crew settles in once more comforted at least by the thought that they have been found and the Navy knows they're alive almost immediately the Navy orders the submarine tender Falcon to make haste out of New London Connecticut aboard it is an experimental rescue chamber in essence a giant diving bell the end verted tumblr looking device had only ever been used in training and not in an actual rescue attempt its inventors Lieutenant Commander Charles mommsen and Commander Alan McCann both accompany the rescue chamber to assist in the recovery operation other Navy ships arrived at the squall is's location and used grappling hooks dragged across the seafloor and attempted to pinpoint the exact location of the stricken some finally a heavy anchor manages to snag the wreck and the sailors bolt up top and below settle in for the overnight wait for the rescue ship to arrive in the squalus the sailors communicate via Morse code with the ships above banging out messages with welding hammers against the hall a casualty count is generated and relayed back to Portsmouth where family members and reporters are gathered awaiting any news as reports of the accident speed around the world global attention turns to the rescue efforts though none believe they'll be successful to date few submarine rescues have ever been attempted let alone achieved throughout the night captain Naquin orders his men to engage in labour breathing or short sharp inhalations meant to conserve oxygen this leaves the sailors with severe nausea and headaches though from time to time the captain releases stored oxygen to help the symptoms they might still have to swim for it and if so the men would need to be in physical condition to do so at zero 800 hours the Falcon at last moors over the squalus 23 hours after its sinking an hour later a hardhat diver begins his descent carrying a cable connected to a winch on the rescue Bell itself he has to find the forward escape hatch and connect the cable hall to the squalus allowing the Bell to guide itself in position over the hatch five minutes after leaping overboard the men inside the sub hear the diver land with a loud thud on the deck over the forward torpedo room with just a few inches of steel between them the men can hear every word the diver communicates back to the surface and are elated yet the diver has been severely affected by the extreme death and is battling confusion and slow reflexes as he scrambles to try to find the hatch a few more minutes in the diver at last succeeds in connecting the cable to the hatch and signals the all-clear up top for an hour the rescue Bell makes its slow steady descent to the squalus until at last settling gently around the hatch a rubber gasket seals the chamber hatch and water is pumped out this is the critical moment in the rescue if the Bell has been poorly designed the airlock could fail and as the submarine hatch is opened the extreme pressure will rip the rescue belfry killing the survivors and the rescuers both three taps on the hatch signals the all-clear from the rescue bell and with a deep breath torpedo man first class John mikowski cranks it open water splashes down on him but the seal holds three trips to the surface have already been made in only ten survivors remain including Captain Naquin who insists on being last loading into the rescue bell the bell breaks free of the squalus and begins its slow ascent suddenly though the Bell jams on its downward cable immediately straining another cable which runs from the winch on the Falcon up above down to the Bell itself under the enormous strain five of the seven strands that weave together the heavy-duty steel cable snap free and a diver is immediately dispatched back down to the squalus to cut the downward cable free once the cable is cut though the crew above decide to let the Bell drift back down to the bottom while they decide what to do next and the Bell slowly settles back down on the Atlantic floor captain Naquin can't help but chuckle ironically he survived the submarine sinking only to possibly die from sinking again on the rescue vehicle at last though the sailors up top decide to pump compressed air into the rescue belt in order to lighten it then very carefully the Bell is lifted up by hand dozens of sailors straining with the steel cable raising the Bell inch by inch from the bottom of the sea floor four hours later the Bell is at last at the surface a navy court inquiry concluded that a mechanical malfunction doomed the ship but exonerated the squalus crew and singled out captain Naquin for outstanding leadership during the crisis 26 men in total died that day but 33 survived many continuing to serve aboard submarines where four would die in action during World War two it's been days trapped in the darkness deep beneath a mountain the rain falls in torrents outside which unbeknownst to you could mean the end sooner than you think your friends are quiet and all you can hear now is the dripping of water on the cave walls you're exhausted hungry clump together with your buddies on a shelf in the cave where the flood water hasn't yet reached but you're aware it could rise at any time and the thought of that horrifies you what you don't know is that the world's media and the public is hoping and praying that you get out alive praying that you are actually still alive you huddle against your buddy to keep warm you keep still to preserve energy you pray for rescuers voices from the dark abyss but as time passes you start to lose hope this is the story of the Thai boys trapped in a cave one of the most heartening and fascinating tales that people all over the world followed from start to finish it's a story of heroism courage and global collaboration already a rescue epic in the anoles of true survival stories those boys were trapped for 18 days and you might wonder just how did they survive and how did they get out we'll start from the beginning it was June 23rd 2018 the birthday of one of the boys he just turned 17 years old at home a spongebob birthday cake waits for him but he won't ever see that cake he is one of the older boys on the soccer team called the wild force the rest of the team were aged 11 to 16 there were 12 boys in total and their coach a 25 year old named hockey the team had been practicing that day in their village in the Chiang Rai province of northern Thailand this is a beautiful part of the world with endless paddy fields jungle covered mountains but also incredibly dangerous caves it's rainy season in northern Thailand and when it rains it really does pour within minutes streets can be flooded rice paddies drown in water and those living in the area are well aware of the dangers of such downpours but the boys in their excitement after practice wanted adventure and that led them to take their bicycles through the rice paddies and up toward the mountain up there was one of their favorite spots the Tamla Wong cave complex they liked nothing more than to enter its depths and explore but this was no day for exploration usually during the wet season the cave is a no-go area due to the fact that heavy rains can fill the cave with water the boy didn't care or didn't know and they parked their bikes and went inside it wasn't as if they hadn't done this before in the past they'd walked as far as eight kilometers into the darkness only with cheap flashlights and for them it was kind of a dare and initiation this day was no different and like before they didn't only leave their bicycles but also their backpacks the birthday boys parents meanwhile waited at home and it got darker and darker something was wrong little did the parents know that the team had ventured far into this massive cave the fourth biggest cave complex in the country if you translate its full-time into English it reads the great cave and water source of the Sleeping Lady mountain that sleeping lady was known to have eaten people in the past explorers who had entered and never come out an expatriate guide working in Thailand later told the BBC that the cave was muddy and the water moved through it fast on days of heavy rain even the most experienced cavers wouldn't go near it and so we have a bunch of kids who have walked far into the cave and outside an almighty storm is broken when darkness fell and the rains came harder the parents talked about how some of the boys had discussed going into the cave now there was panic in that panic turned into intense fear when the parents went into the cave entrance and saw their children's bikes and bags inside the cave the boys now knew they were in trouble not only was rain falling outside but it had been falling for days on end suddenly they found themselves surrounded by rising water a flash flood it seemed had occurred right around them their coach said go scramble get out of here now or we're going to drown they couldn't turn back and so moved farther into the darkness the trail they had used was now a river a place of no return they passed a place that usually stayed dry nicknamed Pattaya Beach but even that flooded it was their favorite spot too eventually they managed to find a shelf where they could sit maybe they thought the water would recede but it didn't and they would sit there without food for eighteen days they had flashlights but they were told only to use them now and again this was no time to be afraid of the dark Aki the coach did make one attempt to swim through the water but he soon swam back it was stay or die they used rocks to make the Shelf higher so as to stay away from the water in the pitch-black the coach told the worried boys that the only thing to do now was to stay calm had been a monk in the past and he told the boys one way to get through this was to think of nothing empty the mind meditate and that's what they did they were also quite lucky because even though the body can go long periods of time without food water is necessary they didn't have to resort to drinking the muddy water from the floor because natural clean water drips down the cave walls they have enough air because of the porous limestone rocks and the cracks although they didn't know that the oxygen level would get lower and lower they could survive but for how long a gate later told the media I tried not to tell the boys that we got stuck in a cave I only told them something positive and that was it they sat there and prayed and meditated in stayed calm if not hungry as hell outside of the cave a rescue operation involving people from all over the world was happening within days there was hardly a news channel that wasn't following this operation Thai police government agencies and Thai Navy SEALs were there and unfortunately one of those Navy SEALs would later die in the water one problem is the complex was so massive and the boys could have been anywhere in that cave luckily one boy who didn't go that day told parents and rescue teams that they'd like to go to a place called Pattaya Beach that was some help divers from various countries turned up including from the UK the USA Australia and China all working with the Thai divers many more experts from all over the world were also involved it was one of the British divers that made first contact and it was videoed a scene that brought tears to the eyes of many people later one of those divers told the BBC wherever there is air space we surface we shout we smell we smelt the children before we saw or heard them and then they started to communicate with the kids the BRIT asks how many of you the boy shouted back 13 to which he replied brilliant they were all alive many people are coming said the diver we're the first hilariously one of the boys then shouted what day is it they didn't quite know the day but told boys that they've been in the cave for ten days what they did know they were in the dark with no idea how much time had passed you are very strong shouted the diver it was amazing to see those small kids all hanging together on that life-saving shelf the divers then swam over to them using a line and when they arrived one of the kids said we're very happy almost as if he learnt the line in school the diver replied we are happy to and when the world heard about this it felt as if we've been blessed by good news at last the ties smiled that day celebrated after days of saying Sousou which translates to fight fight the boys had fought and they had won well almost they even had the opportunity to write on paper to their parents with most boys saying they loved their mom and pop and not to worry they were just fine the parents wrote back saying they loved them they had a special message for Aki who had written to the parents saying how sorry he was that he had taken their kids into the cave the parents wrote the moms and dads none of them are angry at you you went inside with them and you must come out with them too but quickly a new problem emerged and it seems that the boys were not out of trouble yet not by a long way in fact you see they were found on day ten and as you know if they didn't get out for quite a few days after that these cavers that found them belong to the British Cave Rescue Council and they were joined by expert French and Belgium cavers these are some of the best cavers in the world they had literally risked their lives to find the boys and as you know a Thai Navy SEAL would lose his life it was a perilous cave system and it could take more lives so how on earth were a bunch of kids with no equipment supposed to get back to land it was around four kilometres of extremely dangerous diving and outside the rain kept falling it was by no means a certainty that the boys would make it and again the public pray about this time the search had to be stalled it was just too dangerous as the rains were too strong again people all across Thailand joined in prayer and in their heads said those words Sousou but now the outcome wasn't looking good the boys wanted only one thing besides being rescued they wanted food what do they want they asked for pad crap ow which is rice with fried meat chiles and basil leafes unfortunately all they got was a liquid diet full of vitamins because the doctor said it was what they needed not a spicy dish with lots of oil at least one of the boys got to celebrate his birthday with some hope one of the mothers of the boy said to the press the Navy SEAL had practiced for so long and was so strong but also died how about a boy who's never dived before she was absolutely right tech wizard Elon Musk even offered to help saying his engineers from SpaceX and the boring company would create a pod to bring the boys out but a pod just wouldn't work in such tight conditions the rescue was stalled for the moment but then the bad news came more heavy rain was coming and if the boys were not taken soon they would be flooded and died in the cave it was then that it was agreed that five Thai Navy SEALs and 18 foreign divers would lead the effort it was said the weakest boy should come out first but Aki said everyone was fine no one was really weak as it happened the boys that volunteered first would go first Aki actually said the boys that lived farthest away could go first as they had the longest distance to cycle home he really had no idea that the world was watching them that thousands of people were outside that cave the British divers who found the boys led the operation with many other divers following and many Thai divers waiting at checkpoints to get the guys through as the boys could not panic it was decided that they should be given anesthesia so a doctor went along to to get them out first they had to be dressed in a wetsuit and then a full face mask for oxygen was put over their head they also wore a buoyancy jacket after the anesthetic they were rendered unconscious and now was about pulling them out the problem was or one of the many problems was that the boy would only stay unconscious for forty-five minutes so the divers had to be trained by the doctor and how to give them anaesthetic the journey back took at hours and was fraught with danger at tight points the boys had to be pushed hard through the cracks but all the time the divers had to be very careful not to let anything push off their mask the divers also held their heads high so if anything did hit a rock it would first hit them we don't have to tell you that visibility was very bad when they hit a dry section they had to be dragged on a stretcher their masks were moved and then attached again when it was back to another flooded section pulleys and chain systems were used to get them over sand and they had to be carefully carried over rocks it was a daisy-chain operation involving hundreds of people on July 10th the last four boys were carried out to great applause outside the cave it was reported that while some kids had incurred minor scrapes amazingly they were all in good condition the average weight loss was 4.4 pounds which isn't so much for 18 days with nothing but water they had to be quarantined because it was thought that they could have contracted dangerous infections but they were fine it was a bit sad though to see photos of their parents waving at them through glass walls no hugging just yet for a while the boys also had to wear sunglasses as so much time in the dark made their eyes very sensitive to light people tried to blame the coach for going into the cave during the rains one British diver soon responds to that saying nobody's to blame not the coach not the boys they were just very unlucky it wasn't just the rain that day the mountain is like a sponge in waters from earlier rain were raising the levels the coach himself after the rescue said I would like to express my gratitude for people from the whole world officials and volunteers that came to help us we promise that we will be good citizens to society one of the boys that was rescued was called titan' and he said this I was very happy to see my dad and mom I feel warmer I was very happy I cried we think quite a few tears were shed around the world when those boys were home safe and sound since then the wild boars have toured the world and have done talk shows here and there many people want awards for their efforts during the rescue and well it's just a feel-good story all around a movie will soon be out about this called the cave the date is April 11th 1970 and outside of the Kennedy Space Center three men sit atop millions of pounds of explosive fuel American astronaut - James a level jr. T Kenneth Mattingly the second and Fred W haste jr. have been safely sealed into the crew module of their Saturn rocket 45 minutes ago and have spent that time strapped into their seats awaiting the long list of final checks required before launch command is given at last flight control receives the all-clear from dozens of different department heads whose jobs are all to ensure a successful launch and at 2:13 p.m. Eastern the massive Saturn rocket roars to life almost 5 million pounds of fuel ignite and the mighty Saturn slowly lifts off the launch pad gradually increasing speed in moments the crew is already breaking the sound barrier roaring into the heavens on a mission for the next manned landing on the moon the rocket is a multistage vehicle that conserves fuel by gradually shedding spent stages and thus lowering the total mass that needs to be lifted up into orbit this allows the Saturn to achieve the fuel efficiency required to bring significant loads such as the Apollo spacecraft itself into orbit but it's not without its risks according to the plan the first stage burns for 2 minutes and 41 seconds shooting the rocket to an altitude of 42 miles at a speed of 6100 64 miles per hour at that point explosive separators would disengage the first stage from the second stage shedding tens of thousands of pounds of dead weight the second stage is five engines would then flare to life accelerating the spacecraft for six minutes to a height of 109 miles and 15,600 47 miles per hour which is almost orbital velocity or the speed needed for an object to remain in orbit then the second stage would separate and the third stage would fire to put the spacecraft on a parking orbit around the Earth at that point the Apollo command and service module would detach from the third stage turn around and dock with the lunar module which was secured right below the CSM during launch and extract the lunar module from the spent third stage all of this required an incredible amount of careful engineering and with millions of moving parts anything could go wrong at any time for the astronauts of Apollo 13 though those first few seconds after engine ignition were the most terrifying as all aboard knew that if the engines failed while they were still only a few feet off the ground the entire rocket would come crashing down and the millions of pounds of fuel would incinerate everything in fact the fully fueled Saturday achill could release an energy equivalent to two kilo tons of TNT if it failed at liftoff giving the astronauts on board no chance of survival yet today the rocket seems to be working fine and in moments the crew is breaking the sound barrier and speeding toward their first stage separation almost three minutes later the crew hears the explosive bolts fire off as the first stage is successfully cast off and a moment later they're kicked back into their seats as the five engines of the second stage fire off carrying a much smaller payload the engines quickly accelerate the spacecraft pinning the astronauts to their seat yet in what would turn out to be a precursor for the doomed mission the center engine suddenly shuts down as alarms ring both on the ground at Mission Control and inside the command module unbeknownst to the engineers on the ground and the astronauts aboard the flight computer has automatically shut the engine off due to several oscillations caused by uneven burn of that engines fuel if left unchecked the uneven thrust could produce even more severe oscillations which could lead directly to mechanical damage and possibly outright destruction of the engine luckily for the crew though the computer has detected the pending problem and shut the engine off just in time but even more luckily for the crew the afflicted engine is the center engine had it been one of the four outboard engines the spacecraft could have tumbled out of control at the speeds Apollo is now travelling through the atmosphere that would have ended in certain death as wind resistance shredded the spacecraft to compensate for the loss of the center engine the computer reap lots its flight profile and burns the four outboard engines for longer than planned as the second stage separates and is cast off the third stage is single engine burns longer than originally planned as well to come say for the lost engine in the second stage and though fuel margins are incredibly tight luckily the spacecraft has enough fuel to compensate for the emergency well over a hundred miles over the earth the spacecraft is now in a parking orbit and the crew runs system checks and prepares for their burn window to send them to the moon when some final checks sound the all-clear both on the spacecraft that on the ground the third stage begins its translunar injection burn after a successful burn sets Apollo on a non free return orbit to the moon meaning the spacecraft won't simply swing by the moon and be pulled back to the earth the command module separates from the third stage and as planned spins around to dock with the lunar module which is then released from the third stage moments later the command module makes a small burn to alter its own trajectory the original translunar injection burn has put the third stage directly on a collision course with the moon as part of an experiment that NASA plans on conducting the third stage is plotted to impact within just a few kilometers of where Apollo 12 had deployed seismometers with the resulting seismic shock giving NASA scientists two insight to the inner structure of the moon the astronauts are now safely on their way to the moon and broadcast live to the world below after their brief TV broadcast the astronauts remove their heavy pressure suits and settle in for the long three-day ride to the moon their goal is the from Mauro Highlands a region fraught with hazards as it's rather hilly and will make landing challenging yet the site promises to hold a treasure trove of geological data as it's full of ejected debris from the impact that it formed the huge moiré Imbrium lava plane the remains of one of the largest craters discovered in the solar system and the iconic large dark spot visible to us every night on the moon's face 30 hours into their flight the astronauts light up the command modules engines for a small mid-course correction in order to fine-tune their final orbit around the moon all is still well aboard the spacecraft and on the ground all systems are reading green the historic mission is set to be the success that all of the USA's previous moon landings have been to date 56 hours into the mission Apollo 13 is 205 thousand miles from Earth the astronauts have just ended a live TV broadcast and are stowing the equipment when flight controllers as command module pilot John L Swigert to turn on the stirring fans inside the hydrogen and oxygen tanks in the service module which would help them get even more accurate readings on their levels two minutes later there's a large bang in the electrical power inside the command module begins to fluctuate wildly while outside the spacecraft the attitude control thrusters fire briefly and what have become the second most famous words ever uttered in space Swigert radios home saying houston we have a problem electrical power is slowly being drained from the service module an oxygen tank number two reads completely empty the astronauts are confused and initially think that they may have been struck by a micrometeorite not realizing that one of the oxygen tanks has exploded on the ground NASA technicians and engineers have been recalled to Mission Control from home and their offices the situation already looking dire three minutes later two more fuel cells fail plunging power levels in the service module to critically low levels outside the window astronaut James Lovell can see that the spacecraft is venting gas into space likely oxygen over the next two hours the main oxygen tank also depletes until finally running empty the crew is in serious trouble and desperately needs a way back home lead flight director Gene Kranz officially orders an abort of the mission and engineers on the ground begin scrambling to find a way to provide enough power to the remaining fuel cells to save the astronauts lives with the service module which was meant to return the crew to earth out of commission the flight engineers fall back on an abort plan originally drawn up in 1966 but never actually put into practice or even tested the crew will shut down all systems aboard the command module completely and move into the cramped lunar module which they'll then use as a lifeboat to get them back to earth designed for only two astronauts the ride is not going to be comfortable for the three-man crew but it's the only chance the crew has to get back home safe the original plan for an abort though had called for the jettison of the lunar module entirely and burning the command modules engines at exactly 60 hours flight time in order to achieve a free return lunar flyby however the crew would die without the lunar module so the planned burn is scrapped with the moon's sphere of gravitational influence just a few hours away flight planners have to work fast to figure out a way to bring the crew home using the lunar module yet there's another critical problem to solve as well the lunar module was designed to sustain two people for a day and a half not three people for four days as it now needs to the spacecraft still carries plenty of oxygen as the lunar module had to repressurize after each EBA on the moon's surface but the lithium hydroxide which is critical for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is in short supply most of the lunar modules lithium hydroxide canisters are stored on the descent stage and out of reach of the astronauts who cannot conduct a spacewalk to retrieve them if a solution is not found swiftly the crew will asphyxiate long before returning to Earth the command module has enough lithium hydroxide stores to safely clean the crews air supply yet the CMS canisters are cube-shaped and the lunar module sockets are cylindrical as NASA engineers go into a flurry of brainstorming to figure out a solution flight control works on figuring out a safe return trajectory for the stricken spacecraft flight director Krantz orders a crew to burn the lunar modules descent engines for 30 seconds this will allow the spacecraft the slingshot around the moon and be hurled back to earth and after a second burn on the far side of the moon Apollo 13 would be on its way for a splashdown in the South Pacific but if the crew can't breathe all the US Navy would be recovering from a spacecraft are three perfectly preserved corpses inside Mission Control NASA engineers furiously work at solutions to the lithium hydroxide problem gathering together a store of all materials available to the astronauts themselves with just hours of clean air left an ingenious solution is found the crew is ordered to cut off one of their space suits air hoses using tape velcro and other odds and ends fashion it into an adapter for the cube-shaped lithium hydroxide canisters from the command module much to everyone's relief the improvised solution works brilliantly and at the crew of Apollo 13 sees some real hope of returning to Earth safely yet the crew is not out of the woods yet to conserve very limited power supplies most of the lunar module systems in all of the command modules computers have been shut down this means temperature control as well and the plummeting temperature has the crew shivering even more dangerous though condensation has begun to form on the inside of the stricken spacecraft and there are serious concerns that when the command module is powered up it will cause catastrophic electrical shorts to add to the astronauts worries the command module was never designed to be completely shut down in flight and then restarted with time running out and power at too low of levels for a normal powerup routine flight controller John Aaron in astronaut Kenneth Mattingly who was originally supposed to be on board work with engineers to figure out a way to restart the power-hungry command module with the limited power supply available working tirelessly and without sleep the ground team manages to figure out a way to restart the CM systems while avoiding unnecessary power draws with the earth in their sights and re-entry just a few hours away Apollo 13s crew begins to power up the CM / Houston's very careful instructions back on earth the ground team holds its breath as Apollo 13 systems come back online one by one and then explode into cheers as the command module comes fully to life yet as the earth looms large before the astronauts one final challenge remains the lunar module must be safely separated from the command module before reentry or both vehicles will burn up in the atmosphere typically the service modules reaction control system would fire off a small series of thrusters to gently pull away from the undock to lunar module yet the power failure has left the RCS system inoperable and the now useless service module was going to be released before the lunar module anyways on the ground NASA engineers in conjunction with counterparts at the University of Toronto conclude that the only way to separate the command module from the lunar module would be to pressurize the tunnel connecting the two just before separation and once separated the rush of gases venting into space would push the lunar module away yet the ground team has to carefully calculate the exact pressure required to do so as too much pressure will damage the command modules hatch and seal leading to the astronauts burning up in the atmosphere to low pressure would not push the lunar module far enough away putting the two craft at risk of collision during reentry using just slide rules and with six hours before atmospheric reentry the ground team led by bernard Atkin worked furiously at their calculations with an hour left the exact figure is radioed up to Apollo 13 and the astronauts seal the hatch to the command module the venting the oxygen into the tunnel that connects them to the lunar module the astronauts hold their breath as they prepare to undock knowing that if the calculations are wrong they are certainly dead men and with no way of averting atmospheric reentry any more they'll have a long time to think about their certain death at last the lunar module is undocked and with a hiss of escaping air the vented oxygen successfully pushes the lunar module away to a safe distance Apollo 13 would go on to splashdown just southeast of American Samoa in the South Pacific easily the most harrowing mission ever undertaken in manned spaceflight Apollo 13 may have been a technical failure but was a complete success in testing mankind's ingenuity and resolve in the face of incredible odds and adversity more than a successful mission ever could have Apollo 13 proved that mankind truly has what it takes to make the bold move into space so vital for our shared future even if sadly just a few years later the United States and other nations of the world would seemingly lose all interest in ever visiting the heavenly bodies above us ever again",1:06:34
xMy2O1RVkMI,SEA,Science,Large Quasar Groups,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMy2O1RVkMI,9 months ago,601K views,Science,there are many things in space which are extreme gamma ray bursts neutron star collisions galaxy mergers and above all else black holes [Music] we often think of black holes as these all-consuming dark wells which are infamous for devouring even light itself and while this is true typically it isn't always the case for the most massive black holes in the universe i.e the supermassive engine black holes which lie at the hearts of most galaxies all sorts of weird and wonderful things can happen around the event horizon and very few of them are dark the milky way central black hole is relatively old and dormant these days but as we've looked out into space we've realized that similar black holes can undergo a variety of reactions and when they do we refer to them as active galactic nuclei that's what we're going to be talking about today one such type of active galactic nuclei the quasar the story of a quasar dates all the way back to the early universe only a few billion years after the big bang a time where gaseous clouds were more prevalent and galaxies were much closer together while this era gave rise to all sorts of fascinating phenomena the quasar is among the most extreme and the most fascinating a quasar is an ultra luminous ultra-energetic type of active galactic nucleus the heart of a large galaxy which houses a central supermassive black hole millions of times more massive than the sun within a quasar matter around the black hole is moving so quickly and is being heated to such high temperatures that it is emitting an extraordinary amount of light as well as other types of radiation which shines out into space and drowns out its entire host galaxy from our point of view and they can be seen from far across the universe to understand why this is you must first understand a key misconception about black holes around a black hole objects do not simply get pulled straight in instead they orbit the black hole and gradually lose momentum spiraling inwards towards the event horizon the closer to the black hole this mata gets the stronger the tidal gravitational influence acting on it becomes until a gradient is created in the object where one side experiences a much stronger attraction than the other this process shreds up and obliterates objects such as in-falling stars down to an atomic level some of which will end up collecting into a fast swelling band of matter close to the event horizon known as an accretion disc within this spinning disc the compression and energy is so immense that individual particles can no longer take straightforward orbital paths and instead they smash into one another as they are compressed generating thermal motion in the form of friction the sheer amount of friction superheats the gas and matter within the accretion disk to millions of kelvin and sometimes even higher as atoms are chaotically compressed and energized the result is the release of an unbelievable amount of electromagnetic energy pretty much uniformly across the spectrum from visible light and ultraviolet to microwaves in infrared to x-rays and gamma rays and for some quasars powerful jets are generated which erupt at nearly the speed of light which are sources of vast quantities of radio emissions [Music] the word quasar is a contraction of quasi-stella more specifically a quasi-stellar radio source quasi-stella means star-like in latin and thus a quasar is a star-like radio source named as such because that was how they were first discovered not through visible light but through radio astronomy despite emitting vast quantities of other types of radiation in the optical wavelength quasars are hard to identify take this deep photograph of space on the right hand side we have a star located within the milky way galaxy no further away than a few thousand light years from the earth but on the left we have a quasar shining from billions of light years across space and despite this enormous mismatch in distance the quasar shines and permeates the galaxy as if it were a star in our own backyard [Music] quasars are the brightest and most energetic phenomenon in the entire universe able to outshine any type of star and even entire galaxies containing hundreds of billions of them even the dimmest quasars are at least ten times more luminous than the entire milky way galaxy and the brightest can be more than a hundred thousand times more luminous for reference an object's luminosity is its intrinsic power output measured in watts usually given in terms of the sun's luminosity the milky way galaxy is around 25 billion times more luminous than the sun and so a quasar being a hundred thousand times more luminous than the milky way implies some truly mind-melting numbers most quasars are hundreds of trillions of times more powerful than the sun and they are able to outshine stars and other objects so well because the mechanism driving a quasar is a much more efficient energy generating process than those nuclear processes we observe in stars proton proton chain nuclear fusion the process powering the sun and similar stars is capable of converting about 0.6 of its mass into electromagnetic energy in contrast quasars can be up to 50 times more efficient capable of converting anywhere between 6 and 32 of its mass into energy in order to output so much quasars must in turn consume a lot of mass devouring approximately two earth's worth of matter every second equating to around 200 suns per year the sheer quantities of energy involved can do serious damage to a quasar's surroundings but it is thought that at a sufficiently large interstellar distance the effects become negligible however in recent years we have witnessed a devastating after effect of a quasar known as a quasar tsunami the most powerful kind of energy outflow in the entire universe that we've discovered to date dwarfing even gamma-ray bursts and killing over explosions quasar tsunamis occur when a particularly powerful quasar produces such strong radiation that it blows material out into space akin to the sun's solar wind emissions these electrically charged hyper-energetic winds blast out into the galaxy at tens of millions of kilometers an hour driving away important style forming gases stripping planets of their atmospheres and wreaking havoc on the overall structure of the galaxy itself but don't worry we're not in danger of a quasar or indeed a quasar tsunami occurring within the milky way galaxy as it seems that the optimal age for quasars in the universe has passed however it may be the case that a great many of the universe's galaxies including the milky way underwent a brief stage of quasar activity during the peak quasar epoch in the early universe unfortunately we aren't able to observe any evidence of that in our surrounding space as we're talking about events that happened billions of years ago however there is a saying a telescope is a time machine allowing us a one-way glass pane backwards through the ages when staring out into space we are limited by lights finite speed while light speed is the fastest possible speed in the universe it is painfully slow over intergalactic distances and thus when we see distant objects we are seeing events as they were when their light was emitted therefore if we stare deep enough into the darkness we are able to peer into this age when quasars appeared to dot the universe we have seen quasars at a range of intergalactic distances the closest makarian 231 is around 580 million light years away from the earth however the vast majority we have found lie significantly further away than this some so far that they must have occurred only a few hundred million years after the universe was born we estimate that the peak time for quasar activity was around 10 billion years ago so little under 4 billion years after the big bang we're not totally sure why as we still don't know exactly what is required to switch on a quasar but it is likely that gas supply is a key constraint and back then there would have been a lot of it clearly stars and planets falling into a black hole is not enough to generate the friction required for a quasar but back in the early universe gaseous irregular galaxies not as structured as we know them today would have been the prevailing type and they were much closer together thanks to the universe's smaller size these productive gas-bursting galaxies would have interacted and collided with each other much more frequently than they do in the universe today flooding each other with gas this abundance of gas would have fed mata into young engine black holes at a greatly increased rate creating the density and friction required to allow a quasar to shine today the majority of this gas has been used up or turned into stars and the black holes at the centers of galaxies are now much larger and are being fed mata at a much lower rate in addition galaxies do not collide anywhere near as much as they used to as they have been gradually drifting out of range over time due to the expansion of the universe it is thought that galaxy collisions provide a key mechanism for quasar ignition even in the present day universe as it is one of the only remaining means for a black hole to acquire enough gas which is unevenly distributed making quasars much more likely during a collision perhaps when the milky way and andromeda galaxies collide they too will provide the prerequisites to allow a quasar to shine again as i briefly mentioned earlier the word quasar was originally coined to refer to radio sources and not visible light this is because we first noticed quasars through radio surveys and until that point they had gone undetected as faint stars against the many billions of others out there but with the advent of radio astronomy throughout the 1950s astronomers searched the skies to find new exciting sources of radio waves for investigation and study what they began picking up were anomalous radio signals with no obvious corresponding counterpart in the visible spectrum whatever was causing these signals they appeared much the same as stars residing within the milky way however no known type of star is capable of producing such persistent radio emissions and so initially astronomers thought that they had picked up evidence for a new kind of star [Music] by 1960 astronomers had uncovered hundreds of these anomalous signals with most reported in the third cambridge catalogue of radio sources among them is the first quasar ever identified 3c273 in 1962 astronomers in australia used the park's radio telescope to track the location of one of these radio sources by using occultations of the moon to record the exact point in which it stopped and re-emerged they traced the source to a single star-like object in the constellation of virgo and despite looking like a normal star it was emitting large quantities of radio waves and also ultraviolet radiation and when they tried to obtain a spectrum for this star it was unlike anything seen before with random bizarre absorption lines unlike any known atom or molecule astronomers were stunned these absorption lines remained a mystery until the following year when in 1963 martin schmidt used the hail telescope to reassess this star-like object and in doing so he accidentally stumbled upon the key to the mystery as schmidt attempted to compare the spectral lines of the source with the absorption lines of various known atoms he realized that the patterns were the same as the standard absorption lines for hydrogen but shifted by more than 15 percent towards the red end of the spectrum which made them barely recognizable this shift in the spectral data is a result of the universe's expansion and objects moving away from us because the universe is expanding in all places while we don't feel its effects here in our galaxy the space around us is growing and as such everything in the universe appears to be moving away from everything else and as light travels away from a galaxy and through elongating space to reach earth this expansion slightly stretches out the wave decreasing the photon energy causing them to appear redder and thus the light is shifted towards the red end of the spectrum if that was hard to follow in simple terms schmidt realized that whatever is causing the emissions from 3c 273 it is not coming from the stars within our galaxy the source is actually significantly further away over 2 billion light years in fact and the galaxy hosting the quasar is receding away from us at a speed of about 47 000 kilometers per second and so this motion away from us coupled with the universe's expansion turns the lights redder as it travels towards earth and we can use this phenomenon to work out how far away a galaxy is 3c273's redshift put it among the most distant objects that had been discovered at the time but this raised a much bigger question how could something shine as brightly as stars in our own galaxy from billions of light years away as we touched on earlier black hole accretion is dozens of times more efficient in producing light than stellar fusion and at the time stars were the most luminous known phenomenon whatever was causing these emissions it was far beyond the limits of any known nuclear or electromagnetic process seen in nature before and the mystery didn't end there either in addition to the sheer power of these intergalactic radio sources astronomers then retrieved archival photographs of 3c273 dating back to the start of the 1900s and realized that the object had been varying rapidly in brightness over time considerable and noticeable changes year on year moving into the 1970s we began to broaden our surveying capabilities specifically x-ray surveys and while 3c273 had been varying in the optical wavelength year on year analysis of the quasar's x-ray emissions showed considerable changes on a weekly basis because gravity electromagnetism and for the lack of a better word stuff happens at the speed of light if an object is undergoing global structural changes in the space of a week then the source can be no greater than one light week across i.e an area equivalent to about 1 200 astronomical units so about 20 times larger than the orbit of neptune this was yet another bizarre twist in the mystery whatever the mechanism was its energy density would have needed to be off the scale in order to be so luminous within such a compact area as it turns out 3c273 is actually one of the closest known quasars to us at a distance of around 2 billion light years a few years after schmidt's discovery he was able to identify the spectrum of another quasi-stellar radio source known as 3c48 as the spectrum of hydrogen as well but red shifted by more than 37 in the following two years a further seven quasars were identified and located but we were still no closer to explaining what was causing them back in the mid-1960s astronomers edwin salpeter and yakov zeldovich proposed the idea that a black hole would be capable of producing the potential energy required to switch on a quasar however at the time black holes were still viewed as hypothetical and were too exotic an idea to be accepted by the masses not least because it was not yet understood that supermassive black holes lie at the centers of most galaxies but new surveying technologies in the 70s allowed us to get a closer look and in 1973 we realized that the fuzziness that had been detected around quasars was actually starlight from a surrounding galaxy providing a crucial piece of insight into their nature until then we had no idea where quasars were occurring in the universe but this demonstrated that they were occurring at the centers of distant galaxies this coupled with an increased understanding of engine black holes led to the hypothesis that if most distant galaxies contain an extremely compact central black hole surrounded by gas then it stands to reason that these equally as compact centralized galactic radio sources are the result of gas and matter flowing into black holes then in the 1990s technology finally reached the point at which we were able to get close to still with the hubble telescope in particular providing detailed pictures of quasars and the galaxies that surround them today we have identified more than 750 000 of them at a range of redshifts with most coming from the sloan digital sky survey quasar catalogue quasars can come in pairs although most of the time this is due to a phenomenon known as gravitational lensing where the light from a single quasar is warped as it passes by a massive object such as a galaxy causing the light from a single quasar to appear as two in the sky known as a double quasar or twin quasar however in the last five years we've managed to find evidence that quasars can come in genuine binary triplet and even quadruplet systems likely the product of compound galaxy collisions within massive gas clouds in the early universe however groups of quasars can get even larger still ever since the 80s when we started mapping large numbers of them we've known that quasars tend to come in clusterings in the sky but we didn't realize just how significant these clusterings can be first discovered in 1982 a large quasar group or lqg is a collection of galaxies with active galactic nuclei which are arranged in what appear to be sheets walls and branches and they constitute some of the largest and most exotic cosmic structures we've ever seen because quasars are a product of active evolving and interacting galaxies large quasar groups would suggest the early stages of formation for an underlying galactic structure such as a galaxy supercluster or any other region of enhanced mass and the quasars illuminate these regions like led lights around branches of a christmas tree [Music] however it is also important to remember that we only really see quasars as they were very near the beginning of the universe back when it was much smaller and more compact while galaxy clusters and superclusters may be known as similar multi-billion light-year dimensions in our local universe today quasar groups are structures of the early universe thus finding structures of this size this early on in the universe's life forces us to revisit our assumptions about the distribution of matter and the overall homogeneity of the universe one of our fundamental assumptions about space dating all the way back to the days of einstein is the cosmological principle the idea that the universe's contents is largely homogeneous in other words evenly distributed when viewed on a large enough scale with only minor internal fluctuations which even out over vast distances if this assumption is true as we believe it to be then it should place an upper bound limit on how large gravitationally bound cosmic structures can become in 2010 astronomers jason yadev and his team predicted that the scale of the universe's homogeneity determined by ripples which occurred in the earliest nanoseconds of the universe's life should limit gravitationally bound areas of enhanced mass to a maximum dimension of about 1.2 billion light years and so if we find cosmic structures above this size limit then some of our most fundamental ideas on cosmology are challenged and as it so happens many of the largest cosmic structures that we have identified seem to sit above this benchmark some far above it in fact the question is are these real structures that are connected by gravity or are they a product of something else like a chance alignment of galaxy structures at the time we exist to observe them or perhaps even an artifact as a result of the data processing methods used to identify them of this cosmic top ten three are large quasar groups the clause campusano lqg u1.11 and finally the huge lqg yes it really is called the huge large quasar group all three of these structures are located within a similar region of the sky around the constellation of leo and were identified from data recorded by the sloan digital sky survey all three were identified at least in part by roger g claus an astronomer at the british university of central lancashire who has spent his career studying quasars and large quasar groups the first of his discoveries is the smallest the clause campusano lqg it is located within the constellation of leo and was discovered in 1991 by roger claus and luis capizano hence its name the structure constitutes a total of 34 quasars extending over an expanse of more than 2 billion light years across at the time it was the largest cosmic structure that had ever been discovered as well as one of the most complex and oldest its light is over nine and a half billion years old and so a structure of this size forming this early on in the universe's life represents a serious anomaly in our models of the homogeneity scale while investigating and remapping the clouds campusano lqg in 2011 klaus and his team found another even larger lqg in the sloan digital sky survey data this quasar group dubbed u1.11 after its redshift value is a grouping of 38 quasars located around 8.8 billion light years away from the earth closer to us than the klaus kampusano group and adjacent to it are only two degrees of the sky away it extends over 2.5 billion light years through the constellations of leo and virgo and broke its predecessor's 20-year record as the largest known cosmic structure if genuine it would represent an even larger contradiction to the homogeneity scale [Music] finally the largest grouping of them all is the huge large quasar group another structure discovered by klaus and his team two years after the discovery of u1.11 while the previous two large quasar groups are enormous this one dwarfs both of them a grouping of 73 quasars extending over a distance of 4 billion light years like the others the huge large quasar group is located within the constellation of leo and like its predecessor was due to be named after its redshift value at 1.27 equating to a distance of around 9 billion light years very similar to the clause campusano lqg and so the proximity of these two groups has led some to speculate that they may be indicative of an even larger underlying cosmic filament which connects the two quasar groups however because these quasars are so far away it's very difficult to gauge any information about the galaxies obscured beneath them and thus as of the making of this video no such evidence for any kind of superstructure has been found so what's going on here why are these large quasar groups which existed so early on in the universe so incomparably large even by today's galactic structure standards do we really need to reconsider homogeneity is this indicative of non-random elements of the universe's expansion such as dark flow or does it mean that the universe is homogeneous but on a scale significantly larger than we once thought well while a myriad of alternative hypotheses may be waiting in the wings to explain anomalies like this the correct answer is probably going to be the most boring while quasar clusters of this size may be possible they more than likely don't need to challenge the cosmological principle to exist though they may seem like enormous magnificent structures which are bound by gravity in reality they probably aren't even structures but rather random assortments of quasars which appear to be connected thanks to our position on earth when analyzing large quasar groups it's important to note that we don't actually see them like this in the sky in actual fact the vast majority are identified through quasar signatures within survey data which we are reading back and so when we look for cosmic structures we are searching for patterns and trends in data and the data processing algorithm is only as effective as the person who writes it in a re-examination of the evidence proposed for the huge large quasar group astronomer shashadri nadatha investigated the likelihood of quasar structures like the huge lqg within a random distribution of quasars to do so he recreated over 10 000 identical scenarios constituting an area of the sky the same size as the huge lqg but with quasars distributed at random within each according to the average density we see in the sky what he found was that quasar groups which appeared to assume superstructure status appeared in over a thousand of them nadatha argues that instead of a vast homogeneity defying cosmic structure we are merely seeing what is known as a long-range correlation patterns in the data over very large distances which take the shape of structures that violate our models chiefly nada suggested that clusterings of quasars of similar size and shape to the huge large quasar group are likely to occur within a random assortment of quasars and so it is almost inevitable that we would find one such clustering somewhere in this enormous universe as nadatha succinctly puts it we are merely seeing patterns in noise at the end of the day quasars are quite rare and are highly spread out over the universe when compared with their size and as they lie at the centers of large galaxies the likelihood of quasars themselves making up a meaningful and connected structure is slim further research has suggested that quasar groupings do seem to align with more dense regions of the universe and perhaps there is some as of yet undiscovered mechanism which allows quasar groups to be more prevalent over distances vaster than yadav's homogeneity limit however like most of the structures in our cosmic top 10 their sizes can usually be attributed to something explainable and don't need to break any of our core cosmological concepts in order to exist sadly we probably won't be able to gauge much more from these quasar groups with time they are all so far away that the space they occupy will have been pushed far beyond our field of view thanks to the expansion of the universe and it's likely that they will have all gone out by now anyway quasars probably do still occur in some form or another throughout the universe but they are not anywhere near as common as they used to be and thankfully not something we should ever have to worry about within the milky way [Music] you,32:25
Gb8LNB9Zka4,FoodTribe,Food,Trying to make James May's ultimate sandwich,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8LNB9Zka4,5 months ago,404K views,Food,i thought it was your film yeah but you're like are you not starting it okay hello viewers and welcome back to food drive hello viewers and welcome back to food tribe today we're going to be making sandwiches but it's going to be a little bit different because james isn't making them rachel and i are going to make them and the reason for that is that we both think our favorite sandwich is the best sandwich i think my favorite sandwich james would prefer rachel thinks hers is best so we thought we'd make them both today in the bunker and let james decide which one is his favorite i like it is it a race i mean i don't think so quality over speed okay so i'll just go and sit outside and await my lunch i mean feel free to stand around and watch and give commentary i'll watch from over there it not being a large kitchen three two one or indeed a kitchen go i am going to be making once james's shot sorry i'm gonna be making a fish and chip sandwich and i'm gonna be using fish fingers and i'm gonna be using chips from the chippy so first off i need some chips ben can you go get some chips from the chicken that's not really cooking is it sending somebody out to buy some chips i'm cooking the fish fingers right from from scratch from the box okay okay um i feel i've had to lower my hopes dreams and expectations being back in the bug out bunker kitchen but i do still think that i'm going to be able to make a good grilled cheese purple cheese and obviously finished off with a bit of branston because i thought that might give me the edge my worst nightmare fish fingers i know that james likes yeah and he likes cheese yeah so it might be quite tight i'm having fish fingers for my fish and this is probably what i always eat when i'm hungover because it's so many carbs just battered fish stuff in a sandwich with chips it's just heaven so if you ever hung over could you make any more noise probably you don't like mayo either do you i kind of like maya i have a weird relationship with mayo i'm doing mayo on the outside because then you get a nice extra crispiness i've bought the wrong fish fingers i don't know they're like not flat they're too tall am i allowed to interrupt government regulations say five fingers in a standard council bread sandwich four vertically one across the top thank you but those aren't the right fingers for it they're too thin yeah they're two interested in the idea that there are wrong fish fingers they should be flatter and slightly wider they're currently square i feel like they should be rectangular what abomination have you bought i bought the cheapest ones because that's usually the best ones crispy batter fish fingers doesn't say misshapen fish fingers does it but you're right they are slightly odd different sort of batter anyway yep i'm sure they'll do i'm sure they will i don't think i've ever used this before either that's a gigantic piece of cheese to put in the movie it's supposed to it's not going to work it's supposed to just sit in the middle i literally never used one of these graters before i just use like a normal what's ben's number i'm going to ask him to pick up fish and shape sauces at the chip shop so i haven't been very ambitious i'm just making what i know it's probably the only sandwich i make fairly regularly so i'm making this for you rather than me how much butter do you like quite a lot well no not too much um only one side obviously yes obviously you haven't said the lurpak butter line lower pack spreadable butter and rented in sometime in the early 1900s very good um that's probably enough okay is it going to have tommy ketchup in it as well yes a black pepper yes no tartar sauce no i don't want tartar sauce that's too posh good we agree i feel like this isn't a great invention it's the greatest invention ever yeah there's a certain amount of user error i mean it's not absolutely foolproof [Applause] [Music] oh i forgot to tell ben to salt and vinegar the chips surely he's gonna know that he might not hello can you get salt and vinegar on the tips please yes i can the chip shop is improvising cheers i like the initiative cheers bite the chippy's shut oh so he's gone it's monday isn't it should i make my backup chips probably what is there there is another chippy further up the road he's gone further up to hammersmith but he could have gone to the cafe if he just wanted chips he doesn't really know the area you'll work it out i'll make backup and i'll have that as a snack okay as long as they're not wasted they won't be could the magic arm give me the backup chips from the fridge please thank you magikarm i went for curly fries because curly fries have a little bit of seasoning on them i don't know what it is but it tastes amazing 20 minutes uh-oh i didn't realize how long things took to cook if you don't mind me i don't want to interfere but where are you going to put the fish fingers whilst the chips are cooking i'm going to put them on the same same tray will that slow down the fish finger chip cooking no no but after 20 minutes of doing the chips the fish fingers are going to be like anthracite and i think the chips probably need a higher temperature than the fish fingers don't they okay i won't make the chips i'll wait for my chips [Music] you've made it somehow look like gastronomy i'm worried about mine now oh my one grill cheese see james why don't i leave and i'll let you guys enjoy your cheesy moment would you like to come and try your grilled cheese james yes i would what are the three cheeses we've got mozzarella because it's a good melty one uh cheddar good mature cheds and uh some double gospel excellent and this is gonna destroy my mouth is it absolutely red hot no no it should be okay by now my first observation is that that looks a little bit like the polystyrene roof tile of a 1970s pub okay but there's nothing wrong with that it's it's beige food which is very promising oh yeah it's got quite a good slightly springy texture i put a bit of branston juice on it here we go oh there was a good little cheese pull then that's not bad though racial okay more successful than the whole beans situation much better than the bee okay my own criticism would be am i allowed to have criticism of course you are gonna tread so carefully in this sort of thing those cheeses aren't particularly cheesy okay so even you want something a bit stronger you need an itchier cheddar okay but the idea is surprisingly nice double bite is a is a good sign hmm thank you that's okay did you call this a toasty kind of fruit yeah grilled cheese but not but yeah i mean toasting the bread with something on it to make it go interesting and brown is not bad lucy brown lots to live up to i'm worried what lucy should have some really you know what yes lucy brown definitely have those cheese i'll have some if you give me 50 pounds we're going back to this okay if you eat all of that no i'll give you 50 pounds one bite no 20 pounds no that's that's unfair and i can't say this because people will say in the comments oh james is just bullying lucy because she's young and he's an but never said no i don't expect you to eat that cheese sandwich i'm just going to give you 10 pounds because i like it thank you i think i need to rescue my fish fingers i think my chips have arrived oh my god thank you quality over speed remember oh that's that's that's oh my god they look really good look at those proper chippy chips you can't be chippy chips in my opinion [Music] look at that that looks satisfying you've got to admit right like if you're hungover you'd be like this ended up just being a hungover sandwich battle i feel like i'm a mission star chef i present you with my sandwich so a few good signs here i've never had one with chips in that's an interesting idea finger indentations in the bread which means somebody has done me the courtesy of pressing it down and that the bread is a bit crap because the indentations have remained but that's good because you want that sort of bread in a fish finger sandwich claggy it doesn't stick to the roof of your mouth a bit it's not quite right here we go fish fingers chip shop chips tomato ketchup tomato ketchup tomato ketchup and some more tomato ketchup just in case that wasn't enough tomato ketchup oh i like the addition on the side why is this so stressful i know isn't it i was such a tense moment it's just fantastic it's unbelievable i'm so happy i'm sorry rachel i do like your cheese i mean it's understandable it's understandable god that is it looks excellent do you want to try yes i do taste of 1978. well we made a fake taster sauce bang my only criticism would be lucy brown i always do the fish fingers in the frying pan it makes smoke and it makes a smell and it's a bit terrible but it does mean that the breadcrumbs or the batter in this case goes a little bit brown and then you get that extra tiny bit of extra flavor but it is very much like one texture yeah well i usually it's fan can i say fantastic on the food truck it is i usually microwave don't look so pleased with yourself this is the first time you've ever you've never smiled on food tribe before you're doing it now i'm trying not to um i usually mic with fish fingers and then fry them to get that crispiness because it's so much quicker you microwave them for 30 seconds and they go all mushy and horrible but then you fry them and they get all crispy and it saves you the time but obviously you're anti-microwave so i couldn't do that today it's the smell texture and level of aspiration of 1978. if you had to put one thing in the i was going to say the pompadour center but that's ridiculous in the millennium dome to say this is what 1978 was about it's that there it is you're concluding remarks please end on a high note yeah and don't forget to say like comment subscribe i've got i'll go further i hope you enjoyed this video if you did tell us why in the comments down below remember to like to i'll let you do like comment subscribe thank you for watching [Music] you,12:02
ysEN5RaKOlA,Coder Coder,"Tech,Informative",Learn web development as an absolute beginner,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysEN5RaKOlA,2 years ago,1.7M views,"Tech,Informative","If you want to learn web development, where 
do you even start? It's hard to find the right   advice without suffering from information overload.
That's why I've created this beginner's roadmap!   it lays out all the basics you need to learn 
web development we're going to go through each   step so by the end of this guide you'll have an 
understanding of the basics of web development and   what skills you need to learn I recommend doing 
steps 1 2 & 3 in order then depending on whether   you want to focus on more front-end or back-end 
you can do steps 4A or 4B. I personally think   it's a good idea for front-end web developers to 
learn at least a little bit of back-end and vice   versa knowing the basics of both will help 
you know if you like front-end or back-end   web development better sound good let's dig deeper 
into the roadmap before you get into actual coding   you'll need to understand some general concepts 
as you start your journey into web development how   websites work the difference between front-end and 
back-end and using a code editor all websites at   the most basic are just a bunch of files that are 
stored on a computer called a server this server   is connected to the Internet you can then load 
that website through a browser like Chrome Firefox   or Safari on your computer or on your phone 
your browser is also called the client in this   situation so every time you're on the Internet 
you the client are loading data from the server   as well as submitting data back to the server this 
back and forth between the client and the server   is the basis of the internet web developer roles 
typically fall into three categories front end   back end and full stack the terms front end back 
end and full stack web developer describe what   part of the client-server relationship that you're 
working with fernand means that you're dealing   mainly with the client-side it's called the front 
end because it's what you can see in the browser   conversely the back end is the part of the website 
that you can't really see but it handles a lot of   the logic and functionality that is necessary for 
everything to work one way you can think about   this is that front-end web development is like 
the front-of-house part of a restaurant it's a   section where customers come to see and experience 
the restaurant the interior decor seating and of   course eating the food on the other hand back-end 
web development is like the back of house part of   the restaurant it's where deliveries and inventory 
are managed and the process to create the food all   happens there's a lot of things behind the scenes 
that the customers won't see they will experience   and hopefully enjoy the end product a delicious 
meal fun illustrations aside both front-end and   back-end web development serve different but very 
important functions when you build a website the   most essential tool that you'll use is your code 
editor or IDE integrated development environment   this tool allows you to write the markup and code 
that will make up the website there are quite a   few good options out there but currently the most 
popular code editor is vs code vs code is a more   lightweight version of Visual Studio Microsoft's 
main IDE it's fast free easy to use and you can   customize it with themes and extensions other 
code editors are sublime text Adam and vim if   you're just getting started though I'd recommend 
checking out vs code which you can download from   their website now that we've covered some of the 
broader concepts of what web development is let's   get into more of the details starting with the 
front end the front end of a website is made up   of three types of files HTML CSS and JavaScript 
these files are what is loaded in the browser on   a client-side HTML or hypertext markup language 
is the foundation of all websites it's the main   file type that is loaded in your browser when you 
look at a web site the HTML file contains all the   content on the page and it uses tags to denote 
different types of content for example you can use   tags to create headline titles paragraphs bulleted 
lists images and so on HTML tags by themselves do   have some Styles attached but they're pretty basic 
kind of like what you would see in a Word document   CSS or cascading style sheets lets you style that 
HTML content so it looks nice and fancy you can   add colors custom fonts and lay out the elements 
of your website however you want them to look   you can even create animations and shapes with 
CSS there's a lot of depth to CSS and sometimes   people tend to gloss over it so they can move 
on to things like JavaScript however it's really   important to be able to convert a design into 
a front-end website layout using CSS javascript   is a programming language that was designed to 
run in the browser using JavaScript you can make   your website respond to different inputs from the 
user or other sources for example you can build a   back to top button that when the user clicks it 
they'll scroll back up to the top of the page   as we mentioned HTML CSS and JavaScript are the 
basic building blocks of front-end web development   in addition to them there are a few other tools 
that you'll want to learn at this point package   managers are online collections of software much 
of it open source each piece of software called   a package is available for you to install and 
use in your own projects you can think about   them like plugins instead of writing everything 
from scratch you can use helpful utilities that   other people have written already for instance 
you can simply use a slider plug-in instead of   having to code it all yourself which could take 
days to figure out why reinvent the wheel if you   don't have to the most popular package manager is 
called NPM or node package manager you can also   use another manager called yarn both are good 
options to know and use although it's probably   best to start out with NPM in addition to package 
manager is you'll want to become familiar with   build tools module bundlers and build tools are 
another essential part of the front-end workflow   on a basic level these tools run tasks and process 
files you can use them to compile your sass files   to CSS transpile your es6 javascript files down 
the es5 for better browser support run a local   web server and many other helpful tasks saving 
you a ton of hassle if you were to try to do all   these essential steps by yourself three tools 
that you'll continue to come across a lot are   gulp web pack and parcel personally I like using 
gulp for my own front-end workflows where I just   want to compile my sass and JavaScript files and 
not do too much else the last tool you'll need   to learn about in this stage is version control 
version control also called source control is   a system that keeps track of every code change 
that you make in your project files you can even   revert to a previous chain if you make a mistake 
it's almost like having infinite save points for   your projects and let me tell you it can be a huge 
lifesaver the most popular version control system   is an open source system called git using git you 
can store all your files and then change history   in collections called repositories you may also 
have heard of github which is an online hosting   company owned by Microsoft where you can store 
all your git repositories at this point you've   learned the basics of friend development and 
have a choice to either delve into additional   friends skills or learn about basic backend web 
development with additional front-end there are   some more intermediate skills that you will 
want to learn I recommend that you look at the   following SAS responsive design and a JavaScript 
framework SAS is an extension of CSS that makes   writing styles more intuitive and modular it's 
a really powerful tool with sass you can split   up your styles into multiple files for better 
organization create variables to store colors and   fonts and use mix-ins and placeholders to easily 
reuse styles even if you utilize just some of   the basic features like nesting you'll be able to 
write your Styles quicker and with less headache   responsive design ensures that your sales will 
look good on all devices desktops tablets and   mobile phones the core practices of responsive 
design include using flexible sizing for elements   as well as utilizing media queries to target 
styles for specific devices and widths for example   instead of setting your contents to be a static 
400 pixels wide you can use a media query and set   the content to be 50% width on desktop and 100% 
on mobile building a website with responsive CSS   is a must these days especially as mobile traffic 
is outpacing desktop traffic in many cases once   you have the basics of vanilla JavaScript down you 
may want to learn one of the JavaScript frameworks   especially if you want to be a full-stack 
JavaScript developer these frameworks come with   pre-built structures and components that allow 
you to build apps quicker than if you started   from scratch currently you have three main choices 
react angular and view react which is technically   a library was created by Facebook and is the most 
popular framework right now angular was the first   big framework and it was created by Google it's 
still very popular even though it's been surpassed   by react recently and views a newer framework 
created by Evan you a former angular developer   well it is smaller news and react and angular is 
growing quickly and is also considered easy and   fun to use you might be wondering now okay well 
which framework is the best the truth is they are   all good and web development there's almost never 
a single choice that is 100% the best choice for   every person in every situation your choice will 
most likely be determined by your job or it simply   by which one you enjoy using the most if your end 
goal is to land a job at a company try researching   which framework seems to be the most common in 
potential job listings don't worry too much about   which framework to choose it's more important that 
you learn and understand the concepts behind them   and once you learn one framework it'll be much 
easier to learn other ones after that let's move   on now to our last section backend web development 
the backend or server side of web development is   made up of three main components the server 
a server-side programming language and the   database as we mentioned at the very beginning 
the server is the computer where all website   files the database and other components are stored 
traditional servers run on operating systems such   as Linux or Windows they're considered centralized 
because everything the website files back-end code   and data are stored all together on the server 
nowadays there are also serverless architectures   which is a more decentralized type of setup this 
type of application splits up those components and   leverages third-party vendors to handle each 
of them despite the name though you still do   need some kind of webserver to at least store 
your website files some examples of service   providers are AWS Amazon Web Services or nullify 
Cir furless set ups are popular because they are   fast cheap and you don't need to worry about 
server maintenance they're great for simple   static websites that don't require a traditional 
server-side language however for very complex   applications the traditional server setup might 
be a better option on the server you need to use   a programming language to write the functions 
and logic for your application the server then   compiles your code and conveys the result back 
to the client popular programming languages for   the web include PHP Python Ruby c-sharp and Java 
there is also a form of server-side JavaScript   node.js which is a runtime environment that 
can run JavaScript code on the server finally   you'll need to learn about databases databases as 
a name implies are where you store information on   your server for your website most databases use a 
language called SQL pronounced sequel which stands   for structured query language in the database 
data is stored in tables sort of like complex   Excel documents then you can write queries in SQL 
in order to create read update and delete data the   database is run on the server meeting servers 
like Microsoft sequel server on Windows servers   and my sequel for Linux there are also no sequel 
databases which store the data in JSON files as   opposed to the traditional tables one type of no 
sequel database is MongoDB which is often used   with react angular and view applications some 
examples of how data is utilized on websites   are if you have a contact form on your website 
you could build the form so that every time   someone submits the form their data is saved on 
to your database you can also store user logins   on the database and write logic in the server-side 
language to handle checking and authenticating the   logins and that's how I would recommend you start 
your journey into web development I've compiled   a list of resources to help you get started 
learning at any of these stages linked below",12:57
E9-x3jRSQvQ,Austin Evans,Tech,How to Build a Gaming PC in 2020,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9-x3jRSQvQ,,7.8M views,Tech,"hello and welcome to my 2020 gaming PC tutorial have you ever wanted to build a gaming PC well you've clicked on the right video so we're here in Tustin California at our wonderful sponsor micro centers location we're not only going to pick out all of our components for a build but I'm also going to show you step by step how to actually build it so even if you maybe built a computer before come along with us shall you shall we shell us and shall we build a gaming PC when choosing components for a build the place I always like to start with is the processor now this is going to dictate a lot of my other choices for picking different components from my build and really when it comes down to the processor there are a couple of major choices AMD and Intel now for this specific build I think going to be going with your isin 530 600 X so for this build I'm going to be using the assist tough beat 450 m+ now analysis a solid mid-range board which is Micro 8000 this is micro ATX the one I was looking for is our infirmary the thing I like about this is that not only is that a solid mid-range board that will fit in our case which I'll show you in a second but on top of that it will support our rising processor you have m2 slots basically a lot of the things that you would typically look for in a motherboard this has it and thanks to our wonderful sponsors at micro Center they have a combo deal so I get like 20 bucks off when I buy this as well as the riser processor together the next component I like to go for is the case now once you have your motherboard selected which in our case is a micro ATX board it means that you can pick what size case you want so there are a couple of options with our specific build we could go with a smaller micro ATX chassis however if this is your first time building a PC I actually do generally recommend going with a little bit of a larger chassis and because this is the H 5-10 means that we have a nice clean aesthetic it's all white it actually does a good job of kind of hiding your cable management so it's a little cleaner and you have a tempered glass panel not bad for 70 bucks I mean when it comes to building a gaming PC arguably the most important component is your graphics card this is really what powers all of your gaming performance it is a very crucial component now for this bill because we are aiming for something mid-range I think Andy's brand-new Radeon 5600 XT which I very conveniently have right in front of me is going to be perfect its $280 this should be plenty for well literally 80 1080p gaming you can think up and even 1440p if you really want to push once you have your graphics card selected and you make sure it will fit in your case which shouldn't be a problem unless you're working with a very very small case the next choice to have pick is your power supply so this is where something like this power specs hundred fifty watt unit is going to be perfect now it depends on your specific sort of system on what kind of wattage and there's actually a couple of features that you should pay attention to with the power supply so one of the which is the actual size so there are a couple of different models so there's SFX which is generally again for very small systems a smaller power supply generally a little bit more expensive or you can go with something like a full-size ATX supply which is what 95% of people are probably gonna wanna do now this is actually really solid option at only $60 you're not only getting an 80 plus bronze rating you always want to look for 80 plus on your power supply if it's anything lower than that you're likely getting something very low-quality and that's a little benefit with this is it as a semi modular supplying again to a little bit of that later but essentially it means that your cable management will be a lot cleaner because you only plug in the cables that you actually need as opposed to stuffing a giant pile of cables in some corner of your case when you're not needing them usually this is much better the next thing to look for is ran now this is an area which actually is fairly straightforward so first of all and you're les you're building a very budget system I would recommend at least going with 16 gigs of ram and beyond that if you're using an Intel processor the speed is not incredibly important ddr4 is pretty much all you need but if you are opting to go with an AMD horizon system like we are you do want to get something at least a little bit on the faster side of things not necessary it will definitely work with lower speed memory but you can get something like this right trident is Zinio it's 3600 megahertz it will significantly speed up your performance and importantly it also has RGB so there's that the next thing you'll need is your storage now this is totally up to you if you want to use an old-school mechanical hard drive by all means go for it you are going to get a lot of capacity but they're really slow and at this point I don't really recommend it unless you want it as a secondary drive you really should pick up some kind of SSD for your main boot drive they have a couple of options here they're the older school SATA style which is a bigger kind of SSDs you have to mount inside the case they're generally going to be a little bit cheaper but they are going to be slower however if you're building a new PC today pretty much every motherboard should support m2m vme standard and you'll find that over here Nellie is that a much smaller SSD but importantly is going to be significantly faster which is why we're going to be going with the inland premium SSD the 512 gig model which is only 67 99 is well really fast and really good for sixty seven ninety-nine so that's all you need to build the gaming PC itself however you're probably going to want a few extra things so first of all you're going to need peripherals so I've opted to go with HyperX stuff this time around so I have the pulse fire surge or GPM else I have the alloy origins keyboard as well as the cloud singer headset it's really speaking mouse and keyboard definitely needed and so it is time to actually build our PC so we are here at micro Center we're actually taking advantage of their workspace although realistically all you need is a decent-sized table and a very rigorous set of tools Phillips screwdriver literally so a big reason why I chose to go with this case is because it is so wide open on the inside so even though the motherboard won't even fill the entire thing up it's really easy to run cables behind the back of the motherboard and specifically our power supply has a nice little basement to live inside so the PC opened up our next step is to work with the power supply now this is the semi modular supply that I was talking about earlier and there's a good reason for that so you see all these extra cables that comes with now depending on your build you a actually want to use some or all of these but odds are you're probably not going to want to plug all of them in and if we don't have to say plug in five hard drives we can easily just not use that it will make our cable run a lot cleaner when you stole a power supply you need to pay attention to where the fan is so with a case like this we could actually theoretically put the fan up or down however because if you look on the bottom of our case we have a dust filter we should have the fan facing down so all this might look complicated and confusing however it's actually not that bad let me walk you through a couple of the power connectors that we're going to be using for this build so we look for the really big fat guy this is the 20+4 pin this goes into our motherboard every single PC built is going to need one of these right next up we have our CPU power so this is a 4 plus or pen most of the time you're going to want to put these together in this also to the motherboard what for some boards you may only need the four pin and that's why it breaks apart you can see it has a little clip on it so it only goes in one way if you're building a gaming PC the next connector is something you're almost certainly going to need and that is the PCI power now this is a six plus two pin so again depending on your graphics card it may need six it may need the full eight and in many cases you're actually going to need multiple feeds installing our power supply is very straightforward so there fan facing down what we do is literally just slide it into place if you look inside your power supply box you should find four tiny little screws now this is all we need to use actually mount the power supply so if you come a little bit closer here you can see it there are four different holes so I actually line it up line it up correctly there's a hole here here here and here and all you do is just screw it in now one tip this is good for PC building but it actually applies to a lot of things is to use a cross pattern on your screws so don't do it super tight and then instead of just sort of going around in a circle now that I've got a top left end we're next going to screw the bottom right the reason why I use a cross pattern when you're installing power supplies or really any kind of PC component is it applies even pressure so if you do like the left side first the entire supply might actually be slightly misaligned this is this you're just good general advice if you're putting on like a car tire you should use a cross pattern you shouldn't just go kind of like around in a circle before we start building with the motherboard let me give you a brief tour of what's going on here because at first glance well there's a lot of stuff so number one thing to pay attention to is this this is the CPU socket it is slightly different between AMD and Intel but regardless you essentially you just drop your CPU in here and I'll explain that in just a second now to the right of that are our memory channels so these are our den slots as the kids call in these days Ram dims so it's really straightforward open up the little slots and this is where we'll be installing our memory to the right of this is our power character so this is that 20+4 pin the really big guy that's why that gets plugged in and if you look on top of the CPU socket this is the 8 pin power supply so again from the actual power supply you're plugging two things in here the 20+4 pin and the eight pin that's it this is our PCI slot this is where you will install your graphics card now you actually have a couple of other slots and generally speaking you can use these for things such as if you're doing a really crazy build multiple graphics cards but usually you'll plug in things like you know a capture card or maybe like a Wi-Fi card or something in here the nice thing to pay attention to is our m2 slot now depending on the motherboard you may have multiple of these sometimes they're actually on the back or like underneath some kind of cover this one is thankfully right in the middle and this is where you will install your m2 nvme SSD the one thing to pay attention to though are these little screws right here so you'll see 22 42 22 16 20 to 80 and 20 to 110 now based on what size your SSD is it's almost always a 20 to 80 you'll want to plug in a screw or screw in a screw into one of these holes and that screw will come with the motherboard so that's the only thing that kind of gets a little confusing because you definitely need that screw to keep it in otherwise it falls out and then you don't have an SSD so the thing I want to focus on first is our processor Andy's actually done a good job recently of shipping pretty solid coolers in the box and especially considering that this entire set is not particularly expensive it actually makes a lot of sense for a semi budget build so you can see it's a fairly beefy he think now one thing I will say is on the bottom of any of these coolers Andy Intel whatever the case is they'll have pre applied thermal paste this is great we don't have to deal with any sort of tubes or whatever we can just drop this right on however don't touch this when it comes to a processor this is actually one of the more fragile components of the build so generally speaking grab it by the sides and do not under any circumstances touch these tiny little gold pins on the bottom and because this is an Andy processor it has a lot of these pens and if you've been any of these it could very easily kill the CPU all we do is lift up a little metal retention arm you'll see the entire stock it moves back so take a processor there's a Tangled gold arrow which has a corresponding little notch on the actual socket all we do is line it up again do not force it just gently arrest it down and look at that see if he's installed push the little arm down done something right I know it can be scary right I may or may not have bent a pen or two on a CPU in my lifetime however long as you're nice and gentle do not push it into the slot let it rest it's lined up it will slide down and you'll be just fine now we need to toss on our cooler which actually should be pretty straightforward because this is an AMD board and we're using a bit of a larger cooler we actually do need to remove these four screws on either sides remove these little plastic pieces the reason to bring that up is if you actually look on the back of the motherboard we have this little metal retention plate this actually needs to stay here that we're just gonna remove these guys don't worry about that backplate too much because it's not gonna go anywhere if it's oh holy what kind of robot was having a bad day with this man oh yeah one little tip so they're actually a two ways this can go on he doesn't matter at all except that you've got this little AMD logo I've accidentally done it wrong where it's upside-down so just keep in mind which way you want to do it but essentially we have a window on our case so this is the point where if you make bad decisions people will judge you this cooler is very easy to install so always do again try not to touch that thermal paste and just line it up with the screw holes that we have right here it should just rest right into place and with that then we'll just start screwing it in now another reason why you want to make sure that you're applying even pressure is because we want to make sure that thermal paste on the actual CPU is making a nice solid firm attachment this is starting to look like a thing right we have a big cooler and a CPU very important components so you'll see that there's a little cable that attached to the fan so this is a four pin header now there usually will be pretty close so for example ours is right here a little CPU fan header it's really easy to install you'll see it there a couple of notches here so it means it only goes in one way all you do is just line it up and drop it right into place boom we're ready to CPU SOTA comes to installing Rams that are a couple of things to keep in mind so because this is ddr4 you'll see there's a little notch in the middle and the entire thing is actually slightly curved so that means that you're only going to be able to put it in one way line that notch up with the corresponding notch on the motherboard if you try to put it down it's not going in you're probably doing it backwards now the next thing to keep in mind is which slots to use so it's actually a little bit complicated on Intel it's fairly straightforward on AMD it depends so you'll see here that we have four dimm slots which is the standard so we have these two black so it's one in three and then we have these two gray which are two and four for AMD you want to take advantage of these two in fact actually if you look really closely you'll see these little asterisks behind beside b2 and a2 these are the preferred memory slots drop it in the slot and then three two one push and there is where I'm installed look at that we're like halfway there don't worry about the other look we're almost there I'm almost there and the next one's even easier it's our SSD so install this SSD is very straightforward so you can see it's tiny it's literally like this size like a stick of gum now to install it's very straightforward but you do need to keep in mind that we need a little bit of hardware from the motherboard box which I don't thank you no yes I did okay so it's really easy to lose this you see this tiny little screw and a little adapter this is what we need to install our SSD so for this it does help if you have a little bit of a finer Phillips head screw just cuz it's really small but essentially what we need to do is install the little load you call it's like the the it's call I didn't know like the little screw guy so because it's a 22 ad SSD the vast majority of SSD that you will be using are 20 to 80 need to install this thing you're tight in there we go and now installed SSD it's literally gonna take us like three seconds so we line it up with the slot so I usually put it in by it with a little bit of an angle kind of work it in to make sure it actually slides so there we go the next step is to take our SSD screw out and then just literally lean it down use the little screw to screw it into place to make sure it doesn't pop out of the socket you know look we installed our SSD literally like 18 seconds that's it so now it's time to bring back our case and now we have to just install the motherboard now something that will very much vary between your cases is how you actually do this and specifically what standoffs you use so I put this guy over what you'll see is there a series of little brass standoffs so these are painted black sometimes they're actually gold you can see there's standoffs on the top there also some stand-ups in the middle and especially this NZXT case has a little post here this is really nice because it'll help us line it up there also some standoffs on the bottom the important thing here to know is that it's actually very straightforward to install it's the only thing we need to do before actually installing the motherboard is put in our i/o shield now this came with the motherboard and especially we open it up here it just slides into the back of the case so you'll see here that this is where your ports will surface and you just want to make sure that this case is or this little shield is here to make sure that it looks nice this is like she's a little bit of an annoying thing because essentially you have to kind of push it until it clicks so I usually kind of work the corners until I see it not wanted to jump out of my hands click for me Mike for me hey so now all we do is put our motherboard into our case no yet because I'm using this NZXT case I've got that little post in the middle so it's long gonna get it kind of roughly lined up perfect love it and then if we can get it on the peg here which we can oh yeah well the board is in place now we just need to screw it in with like 300 screws that are helpfully labeled in our NZXT little baggie and this will be very close to done surprise surprise the way to do this best and I'm sure you can't see us at all on camera is using the cross method so just start with one corner get it screwed in then go to the next corner the next corner and kind of work your way around to make again you're applying even pressure and with that we have a motherboard installed into our case so if you flip it upside down or right side up it hasn't all come crashing out and we're actually getting pretty close the next step is to install the graphics card which we so helpfully have right behind the case it's almost like I planned it out like that look at that this is our PCI connectors so this is what will attach the graphics card to the motherboard which will go into this slot right here and then if we look around on the backs of the card you'll see that we have a single 8 pin power connector so with the help of our little video lights you can actually see what's going on the next thing we need to do is actually install that graphics card so you'll see right here our PCI slot the only thing we really need to do is take a look at that and you'll see it corresponds to these little metal connectors here so these PCIe slot covers we just need to remove based on where the motherboard and the graphics card is same so we need to just remove this little cover on the back so not all cases actually use this although it's becoming a more popular thing in WoW what jacked up robot crank this screw and hold ball so remove this little piece and the next step is to remove these top two screws which should be pretty easy now it comes to install in graphics cards this is a very difficult process which is going to require a lot of concentrate I'm just kidding you just literally line it up push it it's really easy so just line up with a slot click it boom done look at that now I'll use my giant screwdriver to put this little PCI cover back in place and we're next going to jump into cable management oh boy the least favorite part of any PC build so one thing I am gonna do is because this already has the cables sort of pre run for the fans I'm going to plug these in first just because if I don't do them first I'm burying them and I won't be able to touch them again so one of our fans is actually perfectly sized to fit into this channel fan right here that's actually either really good engineering or really lucky now just like when we plugged in our CPU these fans that are up top and on the back they are notched so they're only going to go in one way these are three pen as opposed to four pin but it doesn't make a difference there's only one way to plug them in so you see we have a little bit of extra slack however I'm just gonna pull that around back right now and we will forget that exists or deal with it later whichever one I feel like so I just then the 20+4 pin the really big guy and I'm so happy right now because look at this little cable channel all I have to do is just wrap it around here go straight down and that's it once I'm done with everything I'll velcro it in and this is making my life easy so you can see right back here I plugged in the four plus four pen CPU power connector now it's a little bit of a tight fit especially in this specific case however I've run the cable up on the top basically just keep in mind that as with most of these connectors there's a little notch on it so it's only going to go in one way next up we have our eight pin PCI power connector now because this only needs the one we have the extra leave will just deal with that later we'll just like cable tie it up but again we'll just line it up look at the place when that's it okay so we have a few different cables coming from the case itself so we have a USB 3.0 lead this is annoying because it will get stuck and you can easily break it so just be careful we also have our audio so this is for our front panel audio and what I'm really excited for our front panel connectors so these are typically separate so what you'll see is you'll have a bunch of little tiny individual connectors which would go to things such as like the power button and the reset and the LEDs go over NZXT will kind enough to provide one all in a single little break so the first thing is we're going to install our HD audio so you'll see this a little AAFP connector here and there's one little pin knocked out on the top there's a corresponding pin missing here which means I want to do is light it up and easily just plug it in like so next we have USB 3 which is this guy right here it's the sort of larger connector and it's got the notch in the bottom which corresponds here again it's pretty easy to install but just if you ever have to uninstall it it's a pain because if you likes to just get stuck and the next thing is the front panel connectors again these are the ones that usually suck however because I have my little notched sort of input I can just do this and live a happy happy life so with that we've built ourselves a gaming PC so before we do any kind of proper cable management before we start putting the sides back on or anything let's first connect to a monitor and make sure it works all right so we had set up our computer we plugged in our USB peripherals from HyperX as well as we have our headset here we have our monitor connected we have remembered to flip the switch on the back of the power supply which I don't see anything oh yeah we see some RGB action that's a good sign okay we have power to our peripherals and we have a successful post as soon as you see this the first thing you should do double check everything's correct so we have a risin 530 600 X 16 gigs of ram these keyboards mice hit f1 and make sure everything is successfully showing up but as soon as you see it post that is a very very good sign there we go we see our 2 8 gig G skilled ends which will have to change the speed up and everything later all of our fans are showing up 3,600 X now from here you want to a couple of minor things so we do want to go ahead and actually set up DCP so we have our 36 66 megahertz memory and beyond that pretty much good to go so we can start cable managing get this thing all sort of buttoned up install coffee of windows and you've successfully built yourself a gaming PC congratulations if you fail this tutorial helpful definitely be sure to subscribe to the channel if you're

E2Hp6k-PcMo,LevelCapGaming,VideoGames,LevelCap's Airsoft Gun Collection (Gun Rack),0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2Hp6k-PcMo,7 years ago,2.6M views,VideoGames,[Music] hey guys level-cap here today we're gonna be taking a look at my airsoft collection there's been a big request for me to make this video and honestly I haven't had a lot of space but we just recently moved and now I actually have some space to show off my airsoft guns in a nice manner I make sure to keep well stocked on bb's and I don't use anything other than Elite Force BBS I've just found them to be incredibly accurate and they make tons of different kinds no matter what your needs are on the right side of the rack I have some of the shorter weapons that can fit here and then on the left side I put the longer length weapons like shotguns and DMR's and eight K's on the left I'm able to hang my plate carriers and then of course up above we have the m16a3 modeled after the one from battlefield 3 this is the gun that really started my airsoft career this particular model is made by JG I've played with it a few times but ultimately it's really more of a showpiece that reminds me of some good old times in battlefield 3 now from the non showpiece weapons the guns that I still use in the fields from left to right we're starting off with the G&G g/km this is essentially an ak-47 although it is modeled after the AKM which visually is almost identical to an ak-47 this one has actually been upgraded internally with a mosfet a miracle barrel and a flat hop so it's incredibly accurate at range I love the gun it's very heavy but authentic at the same time and of course this gun and all the other ones I'm going to show you in this video can be purchased from airsoft gi if you want to know more about the specific weapons that I have check the video description for links the next weapon up is the Elite Force m27 IAR this is the limited edition in tan and this is honestly one of my favorite guns it performs really well it's also been upgraded with a miracle barrel and flat hop for maximum range and I just love this thing I've probably actually used it more than any of my other airsoft guns it has a really nicely built aluminum body so it's still very lightweight even though it is a full sized m27 IAR now there's certainly a lot of elite force guns on my rack and the next one up is the Elite Force Tavor and like most elite force guns it is actually licensed so has the official markings from iwi it's a very interesting looking gun large definitely mostly plastic just as the one in real life is it has a very long internal barrel for added accuracy it also has a blowback system which you can turn off if you don't want and like all bullpup rifles the stock is not adjustable on this so I recommend checking it out in store just to make sure it is a comfortable fit for you next up we have one of my newest guns this is the elite force arx-160 it's a very modern beretta assault rifle it's very cool looking in my opinion anyway it feels very much like an m4 the ergonomics of this gun are incredible probably one of the most comfortable weapons that I've handled I've made no internal upgrades to this weapon but its deadliness at range was still really good out of the box next up we have the tokyo marui m870 pump action shotgun this is really a lot of fun to play with it it certainly is different getting a feel for using shotguns and airsoft if you haven't before I highly recommend trying it out at least once if it's your thing then this is definitely the way to go because it is a gas shotgun and you can shoot six shots at a time whereas your traditional spring action shotgun seems to only be able to shoot three shots at a time and if you're looking for the complete opposite style of gameplay this is the G&G GR 25 is modeled after an SR 25 and what I'm holding right now is a highly upgraded version of the stock model here's the stock one this is what it looks like when it comes out of the box but I'm currently working on upgrading it with all kinds of new features and that will be shown in a up coming video but I will say that this gun still performed really well prior to having any upgrades whatsoever next we have a fun little Elite Force gun this is the iwi uz this is one of my few gas blowback guns and it kicks crazy hard it actually has a recoil simulator built into the gun and it's a lot of fun to shoot it's very loud and shoots really hard people will definitely call their hits with this gun the only downside to this gun is that because it is an Uzi it doesn't come with any picatinny rails on it so if you're somebody who likes to mod your gun you're not going to really have options moving on to my other gas blowback gun this is my kwa m1911 it's a great sidearm I don't always run with it but when I do it is a lot of fun and it's certainly a reliable weapon to have as a backup and because this is a 1911 mark ii it does have a lower Picatinny rail which allows me to run a laser light combo now moving on to another kwa built weapon this is the kwa g36c this is an awesome carbine I really can't recommend this gun enough it's extremely reliable surprisingly accurate for how long the barrel is it's got plenty of pickets evening room on there and I just love the height that the red dot sight sits on the top rail which also functions as a handle I really love H&K designed weapons and this is certainly one of my favorites and staying in the realm of H and K this here is the ump45 from elite force it is a fantastic weapon built really strong it also has a blowback feature a lot of fun to play with especially in close quarters if you're looking for an SMG class gun that is very lightweight it feels very authentic then this is certainly one to consider the only downside is that the magazines of course are ump-45 mags and this can be a little tricky to try and find holsters for next up we have one of my very first airsoft purchases this is the G&G f2000 I love this gun I love the look of it I love the design of it I've added the Picatinny rail to the bottom internally it's pretty much stock and it performs really well I may do some upgrades to it in the future but I just love this gun it is on the heavy side so that's something to consider if you're looking for something this lightweight this may not be the best option for you now sticking with G&G built weapons this is the SG sig 552 this gun is built really solid I just love the way it looks it's got that counter strike nostalgia going for me I've used this gun at a lot of different fields I really like the way it plays out the FPS is designed for close range fields but I have no problem taking out targets at longer range with this weapon again internally it's all stock but it performs really well next up we have the elite force mp5 a5 I've been a huge fan of the MP five for the longest time I like 9-millimeter SMGs there's just something really cool about it I like you from counter-strike I like the compact design of it the collapsible stock on this one is really cool it's mostly metal construction has a very good weight to it looks very realistic and it even has a burst fire mode which is something that not a lot of airsoft guns come with again if you're in the market for a cool-looking SMG this is definitely one I would recommend next up we have my kwa CQ Armand - this has actually been further modded with a madbull rail on the front end there I've used it with the madbull battle-ax stock initially this gun has gone through a lot of changes a lot of different flash hiders and stuff on it it's just a really fun gun to interchange with different parts on it it performs really well and of course the gun comes with that legendary kwa reliability which is certainly something that you're gonna want in airsoft those guns tend to break down a lot if you have a $200 starter budget for airsoft I would highly recommend this as a beginning gun next up we have another m4 but this is a completely different style of weapon because it is pneumatic it is my only pneumatic airsoft gun it's made by PolarStar it has a vfc bullet body the build on this gun is phenomenal I don't think I have any other gun that feels as solid or realistic as this one the technical model name for this gun is the P ar-15 and without question it is the best performing gun I own accuracy range trigger response it is just unparalleled if you have the funds I would recommend going PolarStar if you want the ultimate performance next up we have the Elite Force m4 carbine this is a basic starter gun I really like it it actually performs pretty darn well for being a hundred and thirty dollar gun and I'm gonna use this as sort of my project gun I'm gonna upgrade the internals learn about working on airsoft guns I really do recommend this especially if you're on a tight budget so that pretty much wraps it up for my airsoft gun rack video I hope you guys enjoyed it remember to check the video description for links to the specific weapons and their product pages for more information stay tuned for more airsoft content from me and as always guys I'll see you next time this is level cat [Music] you,9:11
Ze0kq-ROeaU,penguinz0,"Blog,Comedy",The God of Slapping Is Back,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze0kq-ROeaU,2 years ago,10M views,"Blog,Comedy",it's been well established that the universe is infinitely expanding but I'd argue expanding is the wrong word you see I think the universe is running away as far as possible from one man Vassili Komatsu key the god hand the slap that could overthrow empires vasily Komatsu key is the hardest slapping organism in the entire universe I'd wager we don't have like a [ __ ] tournament of power Dragon Ball Z style that we can run the test for sure but I'm just going off of pure instinct saying that I don't think anyone has the pure carnage in the palm of their hands like the silly does it's incredible and I'm happy to say in the newest slapping tournament Vasili come on ski makes a triumphant return to the battlefield defending his title as the world's premier slap God now again the whole video is [ __ ] great but I'm only gonna be showing you certain slapping clips from it and I recommend you check out the full video if you're interested in seeing more and with that being said let's get right into round 1 River silly comes in raw and no rubber [Music] [Laughter] syndrome you just go to shinjitsu a real David versus Goliath matchup if David was really into Marilyn Manson tattoos and body modifications over a hundred kilogram difference between the two of them and this man still has the nut sack to step into that octagon nothing but respect for this young man absolutely inspiring to get in there looking certain death in the [ __ ] face and willing to throw hands with them it's amazing to me they say there's nine circles in hell I'd argue there's ten the tenth circle being repeatedly slapped by basilicum on skis hand a glancing blow the beard just brushed it right off he didn't even hit Vasily come on skis skin I imagine it couldn't even get through his [ __ ] force field of hair music I mean I was have expecting a priest to come out to read him a final sermon as he was leaving this corporeal dimension I thought that doctor was coming on the scene just to pronounce him dead on the spot but he took it like a champ he wasn't even knocked out obviously it was a one slap ko victory for Vasily it didn't go past this round but I'm impressed with the iron jaw on that kid right there that young man really bit down on it a normal slap like that on an ordinary man would be enough to ruin his entire legacy I thought it was gonna look like something I'm the walking dead we [ __ ] slaps his jaw out of his mouth and it ends up by his ear or something but he took it real well and another great showing for Vasily showing you why he is the [ __ ] eternal champ round two we have Papa squaring off they're bringing out all the superstars for this stone-faced event and he's going up against Jason Statham as a zombie this is that - my Dillie boys not the best slap I've ever seen papa looks almost insulted that his face even got slapped by something that trivial it seems like he felt it was beneath him like man I signed up to get slapped like this it's like a level-one in an MMORPG going up against the final raid boss level 100 [Applause] as you probably guessed the round ends right there papa wins that's back-to-back first round chaos which you would expect from the champions papa and Vasily the superstars I love Papa's wind-up he really cranks that [ __ ] way back Looney Tunes style and delivers a real crushing blow I had to kind of slap that could change the weather outside now we were introduced to this character in the last slapping episode I genuinely think he's one of the most intimidating looking men on the planet and this only further proves it his opponent cranks it way back and gives a big slap even following through like a [ __ ] three-point basketball shot and he still barely moves now the round actually ends after that slap despite it looking like he took it pretty well that he actually used a forbidden technique that you're not allowed to use in this Olympic game he turned his head you can't do that that's illegal and then when they asked him do you know keep going he said no because it's his instinct and I get that it's obviously the instinct to try and dodge a [ __ ] furious slap coming your way at Mach 5 but you can't do that in this Thunderdome so it's another one round ko who had watched it ago though yes now when I first saw you when I first saw you I don't know how to say his [ __ ] name when I first saw this man step into the ring I thought it was a NASCAR pit crew member that was deciding to be a little adventurous and I thought it'd be over immediately but I couldn't have been more wrong this guy has maxed out his facial defense stat oh yeah his offense isn't that great he's going for like Austin power dude Oh chops on his neck which does work because he says it made him very dizzy because it gets him in those nerves around his jaw and his neck it's just not it's not a slap so it doesn't really work and it's unfortunate because his defense is so good he just needed to put a little more points and do his one-handed offensive traits they stopped the match because he complains about his cheek and wants to see what it looks like so they take a picture and show him and he's horrified of the bloody pulp his cheek is becoming there's a clear bruise outline of this man's fingers across his cheek it's gonna look like a [ __ ] tattoo of this man's hand on his cheek which he doesn't want so he calls it right then and there and that's the end of that match but he went longer with this guy than anyone else we've ever seen he put up a great fight in his defense was really well done it's just a shame that he couldn't get the offense working for him [Applause] yeah this guy his name is Vlad and he's a [ __ ] monster he's like seven feet tall packin straight fire in his slaps but unfortunately his accuracy is his undoing he slaps his neck instead of his cheek which is a foul each time [Applause] unfortunately Vlad just can't control his power he's got like a railgun of slaps but the targeting systems malfunction he just keeps [ __ ] slapping the Adam's apple off of his opponent which is two fouls as his opponent says now that's enough two fouls you're done so he just takes it walks away with the win nothing you didn't earn it his opponent fired back with some straight meat on Vlad's cheek but it's just a shame that Vlad couldn't aim his slaps appropriately I would have liked to see this go more rounds [Applause] this guy is [ __ ] scary he looks like he's here to murder people with his slaps and he [ __ ] does too he's making his debut this is the first time we've seen this competitor and he comes out and makes a statement perhaps even Rookie of the Year check this [ __ ] out [Applause] knocks his [ __ ] lights out for a brief moment that man's soul left his body he just gave him an exorcism through slaps [ __ ] slapped the memories out of him brutal I believe his name is owner on there I don't really know how to say it but my god you you know how to you could feel his presence if he entered a room there'd be something unholy in the air with his slaps those hands of his entering it's [ __ ] crazy that a rookie came out here and delivered that kind of proponent performance he's one of the security men just like the other like giant guy that I think is super intimidating and haunts me in my dreams he's another one of the security guys so I have to wonder where the [ __ ] they're recruiting them from these people these security guards are monsters they were born for slapping and I love that they're bringing them into the mix now I'm really excited because the way they hyped it up and if the captions are accurate I believe the silly will be going up against owner in the next one which will be just an incredible Clash of the Titans but either way a fantastic slapping tournament yet again this was the stone faces slapping contest and it was [ __ ] great that's it so yeah,9:19

JeUFrZtKkn8,First We Feast,"Food,Entertainment",Margot Robbie Pushes Her Limits While Eating Spicy Wings | Hot Ones,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUFrZtKkn8,,18M views,"Food,Entertainment",look can I take my jacket off go ahead go ahead oh my god um I've never eaten anything so spicy in my life [Music] hey what's going on everybody for first we feast I'm Sean Evans and you're watching hot ones it's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings and today we open up season eleven with Margot Robbie she has a pair of Academy Award nominations and a list of highlights and includes wolf of wallstreet i Tanya bombshell Suicide Squad among many many others her latest film birds of prey is set to theatres on February 7th Margot Robbie welcome to the show thanks for having me what's your headspace like going into this I'm so scared I have the palette of a four year old and grew up eating mashed potato so my tolerance for spicy food is extremely limited [Music] [Applause] haha okay it's very nice of you to do this with me by the way thank you I think it's only fair I meet you halfway on this you know hmm I can do that I find that very spicy actually I'm not kidding kind of find that spider thing well we're in for it today so the last Suicide Squad movie I understand that you had to learn how to hold your breath underwater for five minutes mm-hmm do you have to learn how to do anything similarly daunting for this role in birds of prey hmm I spent a lot of the movie on rollerskates we actually have a big scene on a moving carousel and then I'm behind a car and like it's just really hard to do all that on wheels so that was very actually very challenging but ya know the holding my breath thing that's like a fun party trick now it's just a nice thing to be able to say like yeah I can hold my breath for five minutes just like a free diver teach you how to do that you would be able to do it too a few Travie to him yeah if you like sat with him he would he would just yeah because he teaches you you know how to take a big breath and expand your diaphragm and all that kind of stuff really the most important thing he teaches you is what happens when your body's deprived of oxygen and then once you know it's not that scary when it starts happening so it's like so you'll have compulsions when you start getting to this point and then you've got another like 30 40 seconds after that so just ride out the convulsions then they'll get worse and then like this will happen and then like when you come up you go to purge you heard your body of carbon monoxide and some people might pass out like this and look like this but you'll be fine so once you know all that when you're like underwater and you're you know three-and-a-half minutes or something and you start having convulsions you're like okay I'm gonna ride this out for another minute like it's just nice to know hmm Oh yummy don't splash him and manageable oh yeah that's definitely spicy I'm cool then yeah we're getting towards like the threshold of what I've ever eaten before um I was actually just in Sri Lanka and so I feel like I did broaden my horizons as far as spice and curries but this is a real yeah and we're on number two I'm scared so as someone with over a hundred thousand unread work emails I find it very impressive that you're able to wear multiple hats is not only the lead star but also a producer on films like I Tanya and birds of prey what's a more nerve-wracking part of the filmmaking experience for a producer is it getting talent on board or watching the first week box office numbers rolling mmm can I start drinking more than of course and no time living on that my lips are burning already um the most odd the most most nerve-wracking probably the box office because at that point you can't do anything anymore you've kind of like I mean you can kind of pivot your marketing strategy a little bit but really there's not a lot you can do and you just hope that people like it and you and so many people have spent so much time on something that you just want people to like it or even see it [Music] hotter again has anyone ever been this pathetic at number three you know I mean I can't tell I can tell that you have a sensitive palate Margaux but it's not just my mouth as my lips that I like but I think that the measure of it all is like can you keep it going yeah definitely what it is as as weak as I am with spice tolerance I am strong and repetitiveness determination associate so CK and I'm gonna save the milk to later to like I'm really desperate strategic got smashed rata G so before your career in foam I know that you worked as a sandwich artists at Subway I did what do you think was one of the more bizarre sandwiches that you ever made from behind the counter hmm probably the ones I made for myself because I wanted to try every different variation I think I was really good at it though because I you know would really spread everything out to the edges evenly the right amount of every ticket seriously yeah and now when I go to Subway and someone just kind of like throws it on right in the middle like it puts a ton of sauce there like I just it kills me like I actually don't go that often anymore because I watch them make it badly and I'm upset do you share Harley Quinn's obsession with egg sandwiches I'm allergic to chicken egg whites so I love egg sandwiches but they gave me migraines about you so when we did the scene they actually had to make them with duck eggs and it's very delicious but yes I do love egg sandwiches when I can eat them and finally is it true that you once crushed four pounds of pasta to win a bolognaise eating competition oh my god you really done you reset yes I yes I once ate four pounds of spaghetti bolognaise in an hour that was the that's very first a time frame yeah that made it more difficult otherwise I don't know how much I could have eaten probably not that much more cuz I was some I was really sick it was it was a lot of spaghetti it was like a bucket of spaghetti but you won but I won I won by like 300 grams or something I can't remember what exactly but it was a really important moment in my life I'll never forget [Music] everything like the mushroom flavor but the scotch bonnet it's really really hot okay we've now hit the stage where this is uncharted territory uncharted territory I think this is the hardest thing I've ever eaten am I allowed to hold her in my mouth sure a minute well especially for this one because we have a nice long wind-up on this one Margo mm-hmm so as we've touched on your deeply involved in this film I know that it's your baby and it was important to you to give Harley Quinn a girl squad well guess what in anticipation of this interview we have reached out to some of your co-stars to get the inside baseball on birds of prey directly from the source so here they are the birds up first we have jurnee smollett Belle with a question for Margo Margo for me the most challenging thing about shooting birds of prey and playing Black Canary was obviously the stunts those kicks kicked my ass what's the most challenging part for you and playing Harley now a star on fire I can barely concentrate the most challenging part of playing holi was [Applause] maybe the Sun stuff was really hard I mean we had to have to have milk now I go for so far all right up next okay we have mary elizabeth winstead and she has a question for you Margo hey Margo so I've heard that you're kind of obsessed with tattoos so out of all of Harley's many tattoos do you have a favorite and why haven't you given me a tattoo yet that's a very good question I actually do have a favorite tattoo so I'm you don't really you don't see it in this movie because we're the costumes life but in Suicide Squad one you could probably see like a little peek of it but on her right hip she has a dolphin jumping over a rainbow and I love that tattoo because I thought that to howleen Quinzel getting a tattoo would have seemed super rebellious and she had no idea obviously with her life the bleed and at like 15 she probably thought like the most rebellious hardcore but cool tattoo was this dolphin jumping over a rainbow right there on the hip because that would be kind of sexy and that just seemed like something that fifteen-year-old Colleen Quinzel would do so that was always my favorite because it felt like there was a bit of a history with it all right we have one more for you Ella J hey Margo one of my favorite things about Cassandra Cain was decorating her cast so I have a question for you if you were Harley what would you draw on her cast oh I would I would what number we up to your by the way we're almost halfway next we're at the halfway mark okay um I would probably I mean if I was Holly and I was drawing on Cassandra Kane's cost I'd probably write a whole bunch of rude words and probably draw a bunch of dicks Oh something inappropriate to put on a child's cost cuz Holly's not always very appropriate all right Margo I know [Music] which one is this one the las calientes Rojo halfway mark already like halfway and you know what Margo here at the halfway mark we do this recurring segment called explain that grande where you do a deep dive on our guest Instagram so we'll pop the picture you just tell us the bigger story that's me right now I'm trying to eat these wings do you remember the internal dialogue here it looks like you're suffering I mean I'm guessing the ranges weren't doing well at that particular point in time I'm guessing the other team probably just scored or got past us and you played a right wing for like an amateur hockey team when you move to the other dude yeah I didn't know how to ice skate at that point because there's not there's no ice in Australia so I mean there is but there wasn't where I grew up and I always wanted to play ice hockey because I loved the Mighty Ducks when I was little and I couldn't go play ice hockey because it was like an hour away and I was on Saturdays my mom worked on Saturdays and so I played field hockey at school and then when I got to America I was like I'm in America I can play ice hockey now so I was good at the hockey but not so good at the skating like I could go fast but I didn't know how to stop so I'd either just like hit someone will fall over smash into the wall so I would say I was a below average player but the team that's very kind to me that's nice all right yeah next here you are I think this is the LA premiere hmm what was it like to sit next to Tonya at the Golden Globes it was really fun and um she was obviously so excited to be there and I was excited to be there but she just was not afraid to go up to anyone at all whereas I was like oh my gosh there's so-and-so they're amazing I don't I don't want to both of them should be I'm gonna go say hi to Tom Hanks oh no the side door and she would not be often just having a chat with them and everyone loved it everyone was really excited that she was there it was busy actually really sweet but we had a good night and then finally many roads on hot ones seem to lead back to go into Glastonbury with Cara Delevingne do you think that wellington boots are an underrated fashion statement they ought do you know what I think Kate Moss really like made them a fashion staple she years ago wore them with like little shorts at Glastonbury and I think everyone was just like that's the coolest thing I've ever seen also it's super muddy at Glastonbury but yes I would say they're definitely a fashion staple at Glastonbury pragmatic and stylish very ready to move on here mm-hmm hot tie green in the sixth spot I'm actually amazed I've made it this far I'm humbled from the side you're doing great that one's really spicy well we'll keep it moving mm-hmm so I'm interested in your relationship your unique relationship with social media from the point of view of a business woman in Hollywood how much stock do you give to the Internet's ability to swing the success of a film one way or the other I mean these days it's huge and it's kind of I mean closely monitored when people are putting together a marketing campaign and strategy of course it's great to hear what critics thinks but it's not think about your film but it's also really great to hear what you know audiences that's how you make the movie for so it's good and I think word-of-mouth can be yeah can I guess probably kill your film a lot more you know kind of boost it so yeah if you've got a good film and people like it it's really good - it's actually getting easier I think cuz now my lips are numb I can't feel them and my mouth is kind of numbed so it might be easier at this point all right and we're approaching this finish line too stupid they have to bite them that's on you mm-hm I don't know so in addition to acting you're someone who has a lot of hidden talents a true renaissance woman from husbandry to magic to accounting do you have a hack for how to make a tattoo as painless as possible is there a way to do that mmm-hmm be drunk first people aren't really fazed if they've had a couple drinks they also don't sit it's still good so it's good can I take my jacket off go ahead go ahead oh my god um I've never eaten anything so spicy in my life so I'm that would be my tip just um be drunk beforehand actually I think they say when you're at a tattoo shop you can't get a tattoo if you've had any alcohol I think it's ins the blood I shouldn't have said that it's don't it's the wings talking it's the Winstar in the lead up to the bigger role in focus what's the most fascinating thing you learned from the gentleman thief Apollo Robbins about the art of pickpocketing so Apollo Robbins the gentleman thief taught me how to be a pickpocket um but he taught me a little too well and then we got to set and we'd do the scene and there'd be like well you were women to steal the watch I was like I did and they're like but we didn't see it happen not like yeah well that's that's the point that's how he told me and and so then we had to kind of pivot the strategy so that we could actually see the pickpocketing as we went but he the the interesting things were just like what your brain actually blocks out like you could touch someone oh my god in a particular place um he said it's like having a spotlight and you can make someone's brain only see what you'll shining a spotlight on you they can do anything else over you well I would try to take that skill you've learned mhm and channel it into this next wig de bomb beyond insanity de bomb okay Oh Mughal [Music] [Applause] Oh boom boom so hot ones creator Chris Schoenberger he grew up watching neighbors obsessively with his aunt and money and informs me that it is one of the goat soap operas of all time and I was fascinated to learn that the likes of Russell Crowe Nicole Kidman Kylie Minogue they've all worked on the show oh my [ __ ] god what do you think you learned about acting on a soap that you wouldn't have learned if you went to some like prestigious drama school I [Music] think I might die um careful around your eyes um it's so spicy holy [ __ ] like I don't know how I can get more spicier than that Oh oh my god um you have to be WordPerfect ooh and there's they like this switching as they as you act so you're hit your mark or be WordPerfect they and they're shooting it so quickly then there's really like no time to mess up and and and so you just learn an incredible discipline and you can work really really fast and um you yeah just a really conscious of everyone else's jobs done come on in what is the exit process on something like that do you have to give them a certain amount of heads up so they can write off your character Oh I did I gave I am I did I I told them that I was gonna move to America and um and then I asked if they would kill me off in a really like a big dramatic way and they said no because they said well you know if things don't work out in America we want you to be able to come back and play the role again so my character also moved to America incidentally I guess she's still left is back on the show oh my god how are you okay if you if you're if you're out you're out and there's no shame in that Margo it's okay I'm go no no no I don't wanna be out but I can do one more all right salute respect there you know what rather appropriately this sauce is from Australia wonderful [Music] do not count that it's fine it's fine it's fine what does cashed-up bogans mean and can you use it in a sentence oh my god that was even so much oh it's called the Widowmaker fashion um cashed out Bergen I'm very very happy that you have heard that saying is that it's a phrase we actually do use in Australia Oh bogans kind of like I'm like oh no I don't know like a chat or you know you rednecky i guess would be the american but i don't know but i'm i very much was a bogan if if you like me when I was younger when we're out boots out to dinner thinking that was like going out to dinner shoes you're probably a bogan so I was a bogan oh and I cashed out bogan I said what who has money and so it spends money on both in things that are expensive Dumbledore hero or villain hero my favorite I feel you I feel you we are almost to the finish line here and for wing 10 we have something very special planned uh-huh holy [ __ ] [ __ ] alright here we are at wing tine it's the season 11 premiere and we had to do a big so we have all

EwAkH19MB-I,CNET,Informative,How to: Fix a broken front panel on your iPad 2 or iPad 3,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwAkH19MB-I,9 years ago,3.6M views,Informative,if your iPad's front panel is crack like this ones is you can either live with it buy a new one or as I'm going to show you today fix it just remember that this isn't something you should do if you have an Apple Care Plus or other warranty that covers accidental damage also I encourage you to watch my video on what to know before trying to fix a smartphone or tablet it will help you decide if you should tackle the repair yourself or just take your iPad to a shop and lastly understand that by following the instructions in this video you do so at your own risk before you begin you'll need to get the necessary replacement parts and tools on this iPad we're replacing just the front panel not the LCD and we'll be reusing the home button and metal camera bracket from the old panel and you can buy replacement panels online between 50 and 150 dollars just be sure you buy the right one for your iPad and depending on where you buy the panel it may come with pre-cut adhesive strips if it doesn't you'll need to buy them or cut your own strips from double-sided tape as for tools you'll need a hairdryer or heat gun a few thin metal blades several plastic spudger x'g ATAR picks or plastic case opening tools and a phillips double zero screwdriver again you can pick these up online if you don't have them lastly I'll be replacing the panel on an iPad 2 but the same basic steps can be used on the iPad 3 the first step is the back of all the iPads data using iCloud or iTunes just in case something goes wrong with that done you can begin removing the cracked panel by heating its edges with a hairdryer or heat gun this loosens the adhesive that holds the panel to the case heat a small area of the panel until you can easily insert a thin tool between the panel and the case and gently pry them apart if the panel doesn't easily come away from the case keep heating the area also take care not to insert the tool too far into the iPad doing so can damage the LCD and other internal components once you've created a small gap in one area work your way around the edge heating and prying as you go you'll need to leave placeholders like this spudger in the separated sections to prevent the panel and case from sticking back together you'll also need to be very careful when working to the right of the home button the Wi-Fi antenna is attached to the panel here and you'll need to gently pry it loose without damaging it and although we're not really worried about breaking the panel anymore take care around the bottom left corner the panels digitizer cable is located here and you don't want to damage any other internal components by carelessly yanking it loose with the panel separated from the case we need to disconnect it from the main circuit board unfortunately the connector is located under the LCD so remove the displays four Phillips screws and lift it away from the case holding it along the right edge and folding it over along the left then disconnect the LCD connector from the mainboard and set the display somewhere safe we can now disconnect the broken panel first carefully flip up the two locking levers on the digitizer cable connector as you remove the cable from the connector you'll need to gently peel it away from the main boards metal shielding with the broken panel completely detached we can now remove the home button contact using our phillips screwdriver then using our hairdryer again heat and remove the bracket and button the camera plate comes off in a similar manner you'll also want to remove any pieces of adhesive that are still stuck to the metal case we're now ready to assemble and install the new front panel first attach the old home button and camera plate using your pre-cut adhesive strips next reconnect the digitizer cable and flip down the locking levers reconnect the LCD and secure it to the frame with its screws now fold the front cover over into place being extremely careful not to damage its cable at this point we're just testing the panel's fit and functionality so we haven't applied any of the adhesive strips turn the iPad on and verify that everything works if it does turn the unit off lift open the panel apply the adhesive strips now before closing the panel for hopefully the last time carefully inspect the LCD and inside of the panel for dust if you see any gently remove it using a microfiber cloth or puff of air avoid touching the inside of the panels viewing area or the LCD with your fingers or anything else that might damage these surfaces once you're sure both surfaces are clean fold the front panel back onto the metal case and press firmly but gently along the edges after removing the front panels protective film the fix is complete now I'm not going to lie this is a tough fix but if done right it can breathe new life into a broken iPad now if you have questions about this fix or any of my cracking open videos you can contact me through Twitter and to see more tear down photos of the iPad and other tech gadgets go to TechRepublic comm forward slash cracking open for CNET and TechRepublic i'm bill daley you,5:32

manufactured in 2012 but is the possible explanation behind what the Kepler telescope witnessed around kic a 4-6 that has made this among its most fascinating discoveries KIC was observed by the telescope for around three years and it's patterns in luminosity are what are baffling scientists around the world over the last four years KIC 846 has been fluctuating in brightness intensity this is a pretty normal phenomena for a star to exhibit where being observed from our perspective luminosity changes slightly where things move in front of a star and obstruct some of this light usually this is a great way for us to determine what is orbiting a star and is a common method in the discovery of new planets however in the case of the planet passing through also known as a transit luminosity will only dip about one or two percent KIC a46 was recorded over three years to be fluctuating in brightness by a massive 22 percent meaning something fairly substantial is either obstructing it or orbiting it the likes of which we have never seen before not only this but it was discovered by astrophysicists at the University of Louisiana that this star has in fact has been being observed to be fluctuating in brightness since 1890 and these massive sudden slumps in luminosity have been occurring for over a century something is getting in the way either on it or orbiting it and whatever it is must be huge or extremely dense with no known explanations of further information required several theories were put forward but the most remarkable theory was proposed by Penn State University professor Jason Wright who was quoted as saying aliens must always be your last hypothesis but this looks like something you would expect an alien civilization to build in his theory he proposed that an alien civilization located around kic 846 may be building some sort of mega structure around the star this sounds crazy and the scientific community overwhelmingly rejected this but as time passed other theories were disproved and eventually the alien theory was one of the only theories not to be sigh typically impossible after denouncing the alien theory many other theories were put forward to explain the occurrence the first was large showers of comets that were passing in front of the star and this was the most widely accepted this was plausible a shower big enough would be one of the only things that could drown luminosity out so much but unsatisfied by that explanation astronomer at the University of Louisiana Bradley Schaefer began observing the star and looking into its historical records he found that the star had been changing in brightness in the observed manner since 1890 meaning a shower of comets would have had to have been occurring for nearly a century in order to achieve this slump a brightness Schafer calculated that around 650 thousand comets would have had to have passed through the star imperfect orchestral fashion to achieve such behavior while this could well happen through some unknown phenomena is extremely unlikely and hence the comet shower theory was dismissed after this a new theory was proposed being large dust clouds this was also a plausible theory given there are dust clouds bigger than stars occurring extremely frequently throughout the universe could this have been caused by dust clouds passing in front of the star well after re-examining the star over and over again it was determined that there were no instrument faults and KIC 8:46 was giving off the expected levels of infrared if dust clouds were to be the cause they would be heating up as they passed in front of the star which would create much more infrared light considering there was nothing on the saw dust couldn't possibly have been the cause either and this was supported by evidence of another star epic 2:05 five one nine seven seven one is another star that experiences massive fluctuations in luminosity but this is probably dust clouds given the expected infrared of such a phenomenon is happening other scientists put forward the theory of a planetary collision so perhaps one planet can cause such a drop in brightness but but what about a cataclysmic event involving two well this could be plausible but again not only does the fact this has been going on for a century possibly longer casts doubt over this theory but the chances of seeing such a rare phenomenon just as we are beginning to observe kic 8 4 6 is extremely unlikely almost astronomically small chances with these natural known phenomena more or less disproved the only other natural explanation is that it's some sort of unknown event we have yet to discover but this would be an extremely neat and unlikely event given the changes exhibited in luminosity in such cycles instead Schafer concluded the most likely cause of this luminosity fluctuation is a single massive object experiencing ongoing change but walk at that object be at this point Jason writes alien theory was revisited could an alien civilization be building sub supermassive mega structure on or around the star in order to harness its energy well with so many other theories ruled out even world famous scientific minds like Michio Kaku have explored the theory when asked in a TV interview if he believed it was caused by an alien civilization building something he was quoted as saying we have ruled out all of the other possibilities and that however crazy there is simply no other explanation but the question that remains is if this is an alien mega-structure what is it and what is it being used for once again we must discard our willingness to dismiss theories like this and think in terms of this being true if this is an alien civilization around kic 846 what are they doing to the star well the most likely use of this mega structure would be to harness the star's energy and this isn't entirely unlikely there is a scale known as the Kardashev scale proposed by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev and it measures how much power a civilization has access to ranking them into three types astronomer Carl Sagan performed an equation to measure a civilizations Kardashev rating via its energy use and our rating is about 0.72 this means we do not fall into the type one civilization which is known as a planetary system that can control all of its energy it receives from its host star in our case the son Michio Kaku says he believes we will become a type one civilization in the next 100 to 250 years when we truly manage to harness solar power and the solar energy being emitted to us by our hosts why is this important well it is the next rank up that might explain what the civilization around kic 846 is doing a type su civilization is known as a stellar civilization and this is defined as being able to control all of the energy emitted by its host star not just the energy that reaches its home planet but a type two civilization could encapsulate every single watt of energy from the host star and distribute it around the solar system as pleased and what is the proposed theoretical method we believe a type two civilization would need to use you guessed it a massive mega structure being built around a star this kind of theoretical machine is also known as a Dyson structure named after its proposer Freeman Dyson it will basically be an extremely large hollow structure that will be built around the star in question and these structures have been a thing of science fiction although this is the only real way we know how to harness such a large volume of energy this is why Jason Wright was actually much more correct than you may have first thought when he said that this is what you'd expect an alien civilization to build the Kardashev scale holds in its second classification for an advanced civilization that they would build something like a Dyson structure to harness its home stars energy of course if the phenomenon causing the dimming of KIC 8:46 is such a structure then it's very early days they've been working on this for at the very least our last century and it's going to take them a hell of a long time to finish don't forget their star is bigger than our Sun and just building a mega structure around the Sun is almost an inconceivable task for us when you realize how much bigger the Sun is than our planet but just think perhaps this massive object experienced in regular change Schaefer proposed is a civilizations own Dyson structure there is a type 3 civilization which applies this solar consumption to every star in this galaxy but I'm going to save that for another episode I have planned this is for the potential science behind the theory that an alien civilization could be building a mega structure around KIC 8:46 and with all other known natural phenomena ruled out and following scientifically the accepted evolution of a civilization to get off their planet and around their solar system it does make you wonder if Kardashev did predict what we are seeing right now one thing obstructing our investigation of the star further is numerous technical and scientific difficulties in 2012 three years after the launch in 2009 the Kepler telescope that observed kic 846 and so many other amazing new discoveries began having technical problems with its third wheel and in 2013 the malfunction was declared a replicable now the Kepler telescope has been let go and is no longer observing anything despite the four year intended mission being cut short by one year its journey was declared an overwhelming success unfortunately it is men that we cannot continue to study the discoveries in as much depth but excited by the prospect of potential life in this region SETI the search for extraterrestrial life and intelligence has begun searching from radio waves and faint signals in the vicinity attempting to pick up evidence that intelligent life was operating in this location this came to no avail unfortunately but we're still looking for signals today this doesn't inherently mean there's nothing now as we cannot rule out a species that would communicate differently say telepathically though this is a very far-fetched theory a more likely theory for this absence and the puts a lot of inaccuracy on our study of the region is the light delay KIC 846 is 1,400 light-years away meaning light fluctuations we are currently seeing a 1400 years old almost a millennia and a half on who knows what fluctuations could be occurring now whatever the actual explanation is likely a long winded process meaning none of us in our lifetimes will probably ever witness any significant change that being said in the future we will probably be able to do it more clearly in recent years the European Southern Observatory has proposed plans for an 100 metre telescope known as the overwhelmingly large telescope or owl for sure creating such a mirror is currently unfeasible to scientists but they have plans for smaller ones using more advanced techniques in telescopic architecture which could contribute to our know-how in constructing such a telescope if this comes to fruition it will most likely happen in our lifetimes and the prospect of this telescope has scientists buzzing with the massive leap in quality our Universal captures with experience if this telescope is built you can be sure that one day we will point it at kic 846 and maybe we will get a better understanding of what is causing the dimming of the star so perfectly Harmonist comet showers supermassive dust clouds a planetary collision a previously unknown event or indeed a super massive duds instructor being built by an alien civilization well the true nature of the dimming is up for debate but with so much technical data to rule out natural occurrences the possibility that is being caused by extraterrestrial life is a very plausible argument for now though it seems we will all bit left to wonder thank you very much watching and I hope you enjoyed the episode if you did don't forget to like the video and be sure to subscribe for more videos at an astronomical level tune in next time when we'll be discussing the great void the largest object in the universe that we have absolutely no idea how the hell it can possibly exist until then don't forget to reach for the stars see you later",12:05

I dunno.  ⁀⊙﹏☉⁀ I-I have heard that there's very much like a pacifist, or a, like a homicidal maniac kinda thing, so you can go like you can go the route of sparing things or fighting things. And I don't know how much that applies to everything, because like, games like ""Metal Gear Solid"" that I've played before, you could do that as well, like any of the bosses you fought or any of the enemies you fought, you could spare them all Like ""Metal Gear Solid 3"" I remember playin' that I could spare everyone if I wanted to, so I don't know if I can actually spare everyone or if I some of the bosses I HAVE to fight, like ""Deux Ex Human Revolution,"" it was like: you can spare everybody but if you have all the pacifist stuff in the boss rooms, you're FUCKED! 'cause they're really hard. Heh. Can I go through you? No. Okay. Damn it! AH no! I fell down a hooooooole! OH this is showing me the path! Oh, I get it!

Oh, I should've been okay, I can go all the way across to the wall. Okay, I don't think I actually have to care about the leaves here, do I? *laughs* (the sign said you do but whatever) Okay, got it. I wish you would show me the path that I actually have done! ""Moldsmal blocked the way."" 'Kay so...I HAVE to fight?! Oooooh nooooo! I just clicked into ""Fight"" by mistake"" (tell that to that poor froggit from earlier) I'm gonna spare you. I don't know if I'm supposed to be doin' that. Hopefully I can find out sooner or later.

So you can't just spare them straight away- [Reading in a southern accent] Is the rock talkin' to me?! [Reading] [More reading] No! Back down! [What's this? Reading? Ahh!] Thank you, Mr. Rock.

Okay, NOW I can spare him! OH! GOD! I got four gold for that. Shit! I'm really low on health. And I don't have any more monster candies. Should I go down and talk to this dude? Aaaaaaaaw man! There's another vegetoid up in the top left. And there's something else in the bottom left and I don't know what it is. [Ghostily] Bye! He he! What was that all about? Okay, so I have to go into this one. I can't afford to fight people anymore! There's a vegetoid in the top left. Did I do it? Yeah...I kinda wanna search around though...but I don't...maybe I can come back. *tsk* Aw shite! What do I do? [Reading] Okay. Well, I gotta go pee! I'll be back in a sec. *laughs* Sorry!

I didn't pick on you, so don't pick on me! ""Loox is staring RIGHT through you."" Okay, I can mercy him. (oh, thank God) Okay, so there seems to be different tactics for what you can do. I CAN fight all of them, but I wanna spare them all, I wanna be a nice person. I don't know what I just did.  (・_・？) Oooookay...? So do I have to-t- ooooookay...? So the blue guy isn't here, but the red and the green is. Shite! >:( Be another loox. Yes! ""Don't pick on."" ""Finally, someone gets it"" 'Kay, avoid all his SHIT. 'Kay, his stuff isn't THAT hard to avoid. Can avoid it better than a fuckin' vegetoid He was an ASS! There we go. I got 5 gold. I have a lot of gold now.

""Nothing happened"" Did it? Did nothing happen? Shite! Okay. Oh no! OH NO! (fuck) Where am I now? Oh I'm-I'm b- I'm back out here. Okay, so what does this say? [Don't forget this time] So... *annoyed sigh* ""A rotation in perspective,"" so do I press this guy? ""It's a switch. Press it?"" Yes. ""Nothing happened."" What happens if I press YOU? FACK! Aw no! I think I can- I can spare the moldsmal already. ""Bein' me is the best"" He's just gonna dance out and chill out Sweet, that was easy, okay. Thank God. ""It's a switch. Press it?"" Yes. ""Nothing happened."" Fuck! Oookay, do you- SHITE! I don- I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do. It should be- it's probably very simple [For a third time] 'Kay, so you are like: green, blue, red... maybe it's all changed around when I go in here. [FINALLY!] ""It's a switch. Press it?"" Yes. ""You hear a clicking sound."" Yaaaaay! I did it! I don't know why...or how. Okay, what do you say? [Instructions] Am I supposed to trust you? Mmmkay, that's good.

Just keep on runnin'. Keep on runnin' little Sam! 'Kay, so, left pillar then. Ah, it's gonna give me a battle. ""It's a switch. Press it?"" Yeeeeeeeah! It's a pity I didn't see what switch it was when you're there lookin' at it. Fuck! Spare the moldsmal. Oh! You're just gonna be you. Sweet. Just dance around, bro! Good ol' Migosp There we go. I still have to figure that out. You guys are gonna have to tell me in the comments if I'm doin' something good....or something bad. Am I free? I don't know if I should be walkin' on RED leaves. A tree! [Reading] ""I would""- ""than I thought it would."" Toriel! Hi! Are you ringing me?

I'm gonna eat that up! I'm gonna- I'm gonna have a nice time eating that. Um, let's just go find Toriel, let's see what's up. ""This is it."" Aw, I l- I like the way she grabs your hand. ""A room of your own. I hope you like it."" Aawww (◠﹏◠✿) [Reading] Heh heh! I don't know if I should trust Toriel...yet. This game was- this game immediately was like: ""Aww, I'll be nice to you....DIE!"" So I don't know if Toriel's gonna be like, ""Here, have a butterscotch pie!"" And then SHIV you in your sleep. I hope not. I like Toriel. Is this MY room? Aawww. ""An empty photo frame. It's really dusty."" ""A box of kid's shoe in a dis- in dis- a disparity in sizes."" I don't know what I'm sayin'.

Was that what it was called? She reminds me of a character from that. [Reading] Okay, so I fell from the heavens, from the glorious above world of humans, down below, where people are afraid of human attacks, but they just accepted me... It was like, y-y-you fought a war WITH humans, but I just came down, you were like ""Hey! Come on home, have some pie."" ""You did want something?"" Or ""did you want something?"" Why do I always find it hard to read stuff when I'm doin' voices. Sorry. Um, ""When can I go home?"" Aww. [Reading] Suuuure. Let's hear all about the snails. Mmyeeeeaah Is that true? That snails flip their digestive systems? I don't even know what that means... Ah, the pie has one slice gone out of it. [Reading] *laughs* Can I talk to you again? ""What is it?""

Let's go to the basement. *sniffs* *Uneasy silence* See what I mean?! Stuff just changed dramatically. I knew you'd be down here. [Reading] See what I mean?! I'm not trustin' this shit! Toriel? Hi. [Reading] This got scary all of a sudden. No, I'm- I am the chosen one. I will fix it. [Reading] *sniffs* Yo! What's up? Imma follow you. Maybe I should have saved. [Reading] NO!

I'm proving that you- *Confused Jackaboy* None of the stuff is after me. Ooooooh! Maybe none of the stuff comes after me because she doesn't want to kill me. 'Cause my health is really low.

I have to give him a good voice. What does his stuff sound like? He sounds like Patrick Star from like ""Spongebob."" *really bad Patrick laugh* [like patrick] Well, ya found one. Yeah, he did. *laughs* No he didn't! There's a- it looks like there's a bar- oh no, there's not. I thought there was a bar missin', but it's the stump of the other tree behind it. Sweet! That was easy. *laughs* [reading] God, it is. It's exactly my shape, hair and all. ""sup, bro?"" Okay, what kinda voice do we give THIS guy? Uuum... I can't remember what his stuff sounds like, it's kinda higher-pitched. It a- he looks like a troll face! Or like, [like Skeletor] ""He he! What's up guys? He he!"" [A bad Skeletor impression] Is he like a stereotypical villian, like ""Hyaw, nuts! I coulda got away with it if it wasn't for those pesky kids!"" [READING] [laughing] ""Boondoggle?"" (strap yourselves in for all the bad puns) Go- good joke, bro... *buh dum tss* *laughing* Nice! *laughs* That's something I'd do in editing normally myself. ""SANS!!!"" Oh! Like comic sans? Oooh. If that is, then that's- that's clever. Oh, and he's papyrus. Like parchment, like paper to write on, he's comic sans. I get it...wait, Toriel wasn't anything... ( -_- *John Cena face* Are you sure about that?) [reading] I- I, oh! Ah, I was gonna say ""to the bone."" *buh dum tss* *laughs* ""What up? What up?"" It's like [As Jimmy] ""Wow, wh-wh-what a terrific audience."" [READING] *chuckles* Oh, these fuckin' guys!  :) ""HEH!"" [laughing] What?! Oh, I love them! ""okay, you can come out now."" Oh, I can move. Okay. Thanks. [reading] (God dammit) *giggles* [Oh, this lamp...] What about testicle rocks over here? They don't do anything. *tsk* Aw, this is your station thing. [Reading] Do you sell hot dogs? No, okay. [reading] Okay, I'm not sure about that voice for him. Cause his stuff is like [sounds kinda like Patrick's laugh], it's kinda in that range. Okay, I'll try and find the perfect voices for all these characters. I wanna go back and see if I can find him again. Actually, no, I don't, I don't care THAT much. *laughs* You have to go way, WAY back. Okay *sighs* um, please be a checkpoint up close. Aw yeah! Save point! (dat lamp) Save! Yeah! Okay! Well I'm gonna leave this episode here then. This game is AWESOME! I REALLY REALLY like this, it's super cool! The characters are really fun, I really like them, especially those last two guys! sans and Papyrus? Those are really cool guys, I like them a lot. Uuum, Toriel was really nice as well, and she's livin' all alone, back in the- in the underground area.  :( Except fuck that flower dude! I hate that guy. Um, and I like the little battle system, and I like- and I'm gonna try and save everyone as much as I possibly can And I'm really sorry if I can't, or if something goes wrong, or- *tsk* well, I guess unless I fight them, like over and over and over again, I can't kill them accidentally all that much, so I'll see what happens. We- we'll go along. I think this series has some incredible potential because this is a- it's a really cool game, I really like the charactes, the music is FUCKIN' AWESOME Though I know the art style is very crude lookin', like the character herself is very- she's not that easy on the eyes to look at, she looks like a Simpson or somethin'. But, I guess that's just the way it is. I really like it though. Um, it's- it's a- it's one of the cooler games I've played lately! Well, so far anyway, I haven't played all that much. Um, but I'm always really anxious when I start a new series like this because I like- I don't know how long the game will be, I don't know how many episodes there're gonna be. Um, I'm gonna try to keep it *clears throat* to an hour each 'cause I feel like the people who're gonna like this series will watch the hour long episodes anyway, and they'll prefer it that way because you'll REALLY get into it that way and you keep the atmosphere a lot more. The people who don't like it then, they don't have to go through as much because the hour long videos will mean that it's less episodes overall so I think it's more of a win-win kinda thing, so I- HOPEFULLY you guys like it. I-I never know if people are gonna like these things and it's a REALLY big commitment to get into a new series every time and that's why I've like, put off some other games here and there but, I think this one should be fun! A lot of people were askin' for it in the comments and I've seen some REALLY great praise for this game all over the place, and I ca- I'm startin' to see why as well. So far, I really like it. But for now THANK you guys so much for watchin' this video. If you liked it, PUNCH that like button in the face... LIKE A BOSS! and high fives all around *WHOO-PEESH* *WHOO-PEESH* but THANK you guys, and I will see all you dudes.... IN THE NEXT VIDEOOOOOOOOOOO! hey! how do astronauts organize a...uh party, in space? they ""planet"" *awkward laughter*",1:01:13
9tbxDgcv74c,Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell,Science,What If You Detonated a Nuclear Bomb In The Marianas Trench? (Science not Fantasy),1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tbxDgcv74c,3 years ago,29M views,Science,"What would happen if we detonated humanity's most powerful nuclear weapon at the deepest point of the ocean? For sure, tsunamis hundreds of meters high would destroy coastal cities, earthquakes would level countries, new volcanoes would bring us nuclear winter. Maybe even Earth could be ripped apart? Or thrown out of orbit? Well, almost. Currently, Earth's deepest known point is inside the Mariana Trench. The Mariana Trench is a very deep valley right at the edge of two tectonic plates that looks like an upside-down mountain. It reaches a depth of about 11 kilometers, almost three times deeper than
the dark grave of the Titanic. It's one of the last places on Earth for humans to explore. Pitch black and under a thousand atmospheres of pressure, it's a relatively pristine environment thanks to the absence of humans. A great place for our nuclear test. We'll use the most powerful nuclear bomb humans have ever exploded, the RDS-220 hydrogen bomb or Tsar Bomba. Its explosion was so massive that its shockwave traveled around the Earth three times, and its mushroom cloud stretched 56 kilometers into the sky. Its shockwave was strong enough to destroy everything in a thousand square kilometers, its fireball hot enough to burn the rubble. Bombs like this release such an enormous amount of energy at once, that they could boil away an entire lake. And if we set off a nuclear bomb in the Mariana Trench, that's exactly what happens. Let's pull the trigger. In the first few microseconds, the nuclear fuel undergoes its chain reaction and explodes with the power of 50 megatons of TNT. A blinding flash of light illuminates the darkness of the trench for the first time in history. The heat of the explosion produces a cavity, a flaming bubble of water vapor, radioactive nuclei, and the remains of very unlucky fish. The bubble grows quickly as it vaporizes the water around it. The pressure of the bubble is immense, plowing outwards as if there's nothing in the way. Sending off a shockwave that will be felt by seismic stations and whales around the world. And then, almost as fast as it emerges, it stops. On the surface of the Earth, this fireball bubble would grow to ten kilometers the second after it's detonated, as the atmosphere barely puts up a fight to hold it back. But the pressure at the bottom of
the Mariana Trench is enormous. With 11 kilometres of water overhead, being in the Mariana Trench is like being crushed by a hydraulic press from every direction. Here, a second after the detonation, our bubble is about a kilometer across, when oddly enough, it starts to shrink. The bubble overextends itself, losing pressure as it expands, until the water turns it back, recompressing it. The tug of war between the fiery death bubble and water goes back and forth a few times, the bubble shrinking and growing, until eventually the bubble loses for good. The pressure around it is too great, and turbulent water begins to chop it up. It becomes something like the underwater equivalent of a mushroom cloud as it disintegrates into many smaller, hot and radioactive bubbles drifting upwards. And as our mighty destructive blast rises to the surface, it does basically nothing. Just a small wave, and a bubbling plume of radioactive warm water in the Pacific. No tsunami will wash away Japan or California, although boats and whales in the area might have a bad time. The radioactive fallout will be diluted into the Pacific after a few days, although a fair amount of radioactive water and salt makes it to the atmosphere where it collects and then rains down again. Even if the wind blows the fallout directly towards the Philippines, the worst of it probably happens over the oceans. But clearly, the real danger comes from our explosion-triggering earthquakes and volcanoes, right? Even if we detonated the bomb right in the trench at the exact point where tectonic plates touch, probably not. The explosion would vaporize a part of the seafloor, and turn a lot of sand into glass, but most of the energy goes into the water, not seismic waves. Earthquakes are already quite common at tectonic plate boundaries. And earthquakes with as much seismic energy as our bomb happen a few times a year without triggering any sort of apocalypse. But maybe it will affect the Earth's orbit. Since no mass is taken away or added to the Earth, our orbit is completely unaffected. Also, there have been well over a thousand nuclear tests in the last 70 years and that didn't change our orbit, so why would this time be different? The strongest forces humanity can unleash are laughable compared to the forces of nature. The planet is too big. It doesn't care.

nYHDj2sB-rc,Sam O'Nella Academy,Informative,"Tarrare, the Hungriest Man in History",0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYHDj2sB-rc,3 years ago,13M views,Informative,[Music] hey kids I think we can all agree that there are a few pastimes more grotesque than competitive-eating the concept of a bunch of guys pushing their Anatomy to its limits just for sport leaves a bad taste in my mouth in more ways than one but imagine if these men didn't adopt this habit just for fun imagine if some gross biological error forced them to eat like this for their entire life introducing tari tari was born in France around 1772 to a poor farming family it said that his appetite was so voracious that by his teens Tarara could eat an entire quarter of a cow carcass in a single day you think he'd be like mega obese but no he only weighed a hundred pounds by age 17 however there was still a few things that stood out about Tarara appearance-wise for one he had a huge stretched out mouth with horribly stained teeth he could reportedly fit 12 eggs in his cheeks at once much like a chipmunk keeping its chipmunk eggs warm additionally when terraria was full he'd get a crazy Octomom gut going and any other time he'd have a huge flap of stretched out skin hanging around his waist he also stank to high hell even by 18th century French peasant standards he was described as reeking quote to such a degree that he could not be endured within the distance of 20 paces so between all this and is horrendous outhouse flooding dumps his family had had enough all right you're eating us out of house and home here you gotta go man you heard me cake bricks froggy wow he just called a French person a frog that's so racist no it's not they're all French the guy just looks like a frog is all well well too late I'm already offended that's fair dislike after leaving home terraria was forced to beg and steal just to satisfy his gargantuan appetite inevitably people began to take notice of him and eventually he landed a job as a street performer in Paris people would hand Terraria entire baskets of apples eggs and even wine corks and watch in delight as he horked him down without the slightest hesitation normally this went off without a hitch except for one time when he suffered a severe intestinal blockage fortunately the crowd was kind enough to carry him to the hospital where he was treated with the strongest laxatives the 18th century had to offer I would draw what happened next but it would probably get my channel deleted so let's just picture it for a few moments moving on cut to the Year 1795 the War of the first coalition ever heard of it me neither who was in it [ __ ] everyone anyway terraria decided to enlist in the war after all maybe that profound emptiness he was feeling was just a lack of purpose in life turns out no he really was just psychotically hungry even after being granted quadruple rations terraria would still be digging through the trash pile whenever he got the chance after suffering extreme exhaustion he was sent off to the military hospital in Utah the staff they were so dumbfounded by the man's abilities that they decided to keep him there to run a few experiments the first of which involve putting two Rory in a room with a meal prepared for 15 people naturally he ate the entire thing and immediately fell asleep next they presented him with a raw eel in response Tarara crushed the eels skull between his teeth before slurping down the entire creature in one go now this is hair crunching Lee horrifying for a couple of reasons firstly he put a whole freakin eel in his stomach but secondly there had to be some point during digestion where the meat was gone but the bone still remained now for those of you who don't know an eel skeleton looks like this that means Terraria had all of those needle sized ribs stabbing into the walls of a stomach at once and he was fine he also ripped a live cat apart with his bare hands drank its blood and ate everything but its bones and then later gagged up the fur and skin like an owl but you know that's neither here nor there after reviewing our data I've come to the scientific conclusion that uh yeah we got a goddamn demon on our hands but as we all know with great devourer comes great responsibility since terraria was still technically enlisted the military decided to utilize his abilities for the greater good hates our RA it's me the general listen could you eat this box with a note in it for me if you do it will give you a wheelbarrow full of bull organs oh lo and behold two days later he passed the container in mint condition and was given his reward as promised with this proof-of-concept they made him an official spy and sent him into Prussia with a document in his belly to be delivered to an imprisoned French colonel unfortunately there are a couple things Tariq couldn't do that are generally important when sneaking into another country hey he couldn't speak German and be it's pretty hard to maintain a low profile when you're running around like a madman wolfing down garbage and mutilating small animals so he ended up being captured by the enemy initially he kept his mouth shut for once but after a whipping in a day in jail Tarara gave in after confessing that he did in fact have vital intelligence snaking its way through his GI tract the Prussians chained him to a latrine until lebackes emerged 30 hours later the note wasn't actually anything important so they just mock executed him give him a severe beating and sent him on his way after all that terraria returned to life at the hospital desperate for a cure for his condition but nothing they ever tried worked meanwhile the man's endless hunger continued to get him into all sorts of trouble he'd often sneaked out of the hospital to eat the scraps behind the local butcher and fight stray dogs in the alley for their precious garbage he'd also seek out patients undergoing bloodletting in order to take all their life juice for himself on several occasions he was even caught attempting to eat bodies in the mortuary by this point my research I was so desensitized to this guy that I didn't even bat an eye when I first read that I was just like all right I guess he must have been hungry anyway the hospital staff begrudging Lee tolerated Tiwari's buffoonery until one day when he went too far welter RA you've only had three mess-hall raids for miscellaneous trash related mishaps and one cadaver defiling so I'd say so far this week's been pretty good doctor we should probably inform you that a 14 month old child has gone missing from their room Tarara look at me did you eat a [ __ ] baby kirari was promptly kicked out of the hospital and spent four years out and about doing you know whatever horrific [ __ ] you can imagine when he came back he was suffering from advanced tuberculosis and died shortly after arrival during his autopsy the surgeons found that when they looked into his mouth they could see all the way down his throat and into his stomach cavity as you can imagine his whole abdominal region was profoundly deformed basically if this is a normal human this is what they found inside to our RA just like the man's mind we can see that around 90% is devoted towards food and 10% towards everything else so moral of the story here is that now you know what not even I can find anything resembling a moral here not all stories have a point to them sometimes they're just sad and disgusting from beginning to end and now a word from our sponsor

a_TSR_v07m0,Mark Rober,Science,Glitter Bomb 2.0 vs Porch Pirates,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_TSR_v07m0,2 years ago,62M views,Science,this guy stole my package and he's about to open it in his house but what he doesn't know is that this is a new and improved custom-built bait package that is recording him on four different cameras that just released a pound of the world's finest glitter along with some other nasty surprises but to understand how we got to this point we need to go back one and a half years because that's when someone stole a package from my porch and the police wouldn't do anything about it even with the video footage which made me sad and so drawing inspiration from one of my childhood heroes I decided to make a bait package to lure would-be thieves and the Internet seem to like it but despite my best efforts 1.7 million packages are either stolen or go missing every day hello Macaulay Culkin I'm sorry it's just that home alone was the entire inspiration for the glitter bomb no no that's cool I love that just I do other things with my life like run my website bunny ears calm but seriously though your design was good but actually I think I even get a little bit better and so if we call yourself my friend Shawn and I have literally spent the last 10 months designing building and testing a new and improved design for 2019 so today I'm gonna walk you through all the upgrades and then show you what happens when you unleash ten of these bait packages on random suburban porches all across America we started with a complete redesign of the box to make it more streamlined and secure for contrast last year's design was a bit of a rat's nest the fundamentals are still the same or you have a battery-powered custom printed circuit board on the bottom that has a built-in accelerometer so it can sense when it's been jostled and then it tells these four phones to start recording and these are wide-angle lenses so as you can see you'll be able to record the thief no matter which side they open it from and then right here we have some fart spray but we added a second bottle this year so as both these motors spin cams around not only does it spray twice as much but we changed the formula this time around and it is wretched dude oh it's in my mouth man I feel like hitches a turd never done that to be clear and just to prove how much worse it was I sprayed last year's formula labeled a and then this year's formula labeled B for 10 different people without telling them which was which alton independently agreed this year's was much worse and then we keep spraying it every 30 seconds to ensure they get rid of the package out of their house before they realize there's four phones inside this increases our chances of recovering it since we already know the package location at all times due to the GPS tracking on all the phones but even if we somehow don't recover it all these phones have LTE data plans so they'll upload their footage to the cloud right away so then we can see what happened and then we have the main course which is the spinning cup powered by a motor underneath here which we fill with the finest glitter we could find which is actually biodegradable this year as a nod to our good friend Mother Earth we also added sound effects this year so after both the glitter and the fart spray have successfully deployed we start counting down five four three nothing actually happens at the end but they won't know that and then finally after that we added some fake police scanner chatter just because it seemed like the right thing to do so as you can see once you slip this cover over it becomes nearly impossible to access the phones now without special tools and so finally we've got the lid which has these two holes here which we cover with one-way film so we can record the outside world even when the lid is on and you'll notice that this is a total custom print these are the fictitious Buzz 700s named of course after Kevin's older brother and the thieves took just two seconds to actually inspect the package they would see all the words on the side are just slightly modified quotes from home alone in addition to this amazing testimonial and so then we just slapped on a fake shipping label and used a random barcode sticker to cover up the nightly charging port and we were good to go so the idea is the bad guy comes sneaking by and then steals it off the porch and then when they eventually remove the lid a magnet taped inside triggers this Hall effect sensor which tells a circuit board brain it's go time and everything is set in motion and as far as I'm concerned relatively harmless karmic justice has never looked so beautiful [Music] and so now all that was left was to find porches for all the boxes so I sent out a call to all my followers on social media and we received over 400 applicants who have all dealt with repeated package thefts in the past and then from that we narrowed the list down to just a handful and soon we had packages out all over the country we also set up a website so I could sit in my Batcave here and monitor all the boxes to see their current locations record states battery phone levels and even check the camera feed on any box at any time and things started out a bit rocky when we got a notification that the first box was stolen and then we noticed it was intermittently moving all throughout the city so while we were trying to locate it we checked the feed and realized a UPS driver was so convinced the package was real he scanned it and picked it up and it was riding around in his truck next when someone else picked up the box we didn't have the lid seal fully worked out yet so as they were walking around glitter started to spill out there's glare coming out of it yo Nick which is as they say it's totally a scam when you open it it's gonna explode with glitter this lady took it off a porch put open it upside down as soon as she heard the countdown timer though she rushed it back to the porch he stole it from just in a time for nothing to happen but then the thefts began to pile up and we started hitting our stride my god hurry sequence initiated [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] operation super nasty fat initiated 1514 [Music] [Music] after we tracked down this package and recovered it by the dumpster we walked by the store and they were sweeping and spring Febreze which felt amazing [Music] deltad initiated and in the middle of all this something happened that I still can't wrap my head around one of the volunteers we sent a package to who obviously knows my channel and follows me on social media who I even interviewed to make sure he seemed legit decided it would be a good idea to steal my package from me and never had any intention of either putting it out on his porch or sending it back to us after a week of us being really nice and trying to work with him he effectively admitted as such and then blocked and ghosted me and it's just like bro if you're gonna steal from someone don't pick the dude who just spent a year and a half of his life avenging theft of a $5 Amazon package if I'm willing to get that petty over something I could easily reorder what do you think I'm gonna do to the guy who steals the outcome of that year and a half of work I quit my job at NASA to make youtube videos and I only make 12 of them a year so I have plenty of time and I love to obsess over these little details well that's even though this is more of a science channel than a prank Channel I love coming up with these ideas like when I took this Freddy Krueger action figure and taped it to the back of my wife's car right in front of the backup camera [Applause] and so after a little detective work I discovered he gave us his real name and phone number but he shipped it to his buddy's address so I found his real address and then did two relatively harmless things the first is I've heard once the Scientologists have your contact info and know you're even remotely interested they will follow you the rest of your life and so since I had all his contact info hypothetically I might have gone on their website and said I was very interested in learning more and then I ordered $300 worth of their starting course material so they know he's a very high-value contact worth keeping track of and the second thing was I'd assigned over 10 custom postcards just for him for example he's from Texas so I thought a thank you note for his $500 donation to Texans for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign would be nice or this registration confirmation for the upcoming furry convention but the trick is while I addressed it in his name I went on Google Maps and looked like his neighbor's addresses and hypothetically I might have accidentally sent them to a random assortment of houses around him a lot of these are great because it's the exact type of thing where the more you deny it the more guilty you look so some of these will inevitably be hand-delivered to his mailbox by his neighbors who spot the air and he'll always be second guessing just how many more there were and who's silently judging him at the neighborhood potluck now I want to mention we encountered good people out in the world too who are trying to actually keep our boxes from being stolen for example this woman did that but even still the package was stolen just thirty minutes later by a professional porch pirate who knew exactly how to cover up her face but then we said a holdup roll that tape back unbelievably she has the same body type and owns the exact same shoes and pants as that Good Samaritan so we turned the footage over to the police to see if they too could appreciate the coincidence and it just goes to show you that your conception of who a porch pirate is might be totally off I'm just kidding this was a super nice lady who took the package in for her neighbor but it got us thinking and instead of just always punishing the bad guys we wanted to try and reward the good guys so in some cases we left it by an apartment mailbox and we change the label to a real name and left tons of contact information like phone number and email all over the label and quite a few people took the package back to their house but instead of opening they called to tell us they had our package because they were worried someone else would take it and so instead of glitter and fart spray I gave them four hundred dollars because that was the opportunity cost for them when they made the right choice thank you for being one of the good ones then others however didn't make the call [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] sound is one of my favorite physics topics to discuss because it becomes so much easier to understand if you just have the right mental model the key is to understand that the air all around us is a fluid like water just way less dense for example you could see the loud sound waves coming from the revolver Destin is shooting here my friends opposed supported this video so I created a simple demo to show the fundamentals of how they're able to achieve the insane amounts of noise cancellation in their headphones I'll first turn on this speaker that is playing a tone of 500 Hertz you could hear it in this mic then if I turn on a second speaker playing the same tone the waves will combine just like two waves crossing in the water and it will be twice as loud but if I reverse the polarity on one of the speakers it will flip the wave upside down and now instead of combining the waves will cancel each other out and the sound is much quieter than if only one of the speaker's was on this is the principle behind how they achieve noise canceling like in the headphone 700s here they measure and then playback a flipped pressure wave of the jet engine which is why it goes so quiet and it's really hard to demonstrate this without trying it on yourself but this should give you an idea of what their engineers are capable of this leafblower this is what my voice sounds like on the camera mic but if you were to come this is exactly what my voice would sound like these things are just the best especially when traveling they've got a battery life of up to 20 hours which has always been way more than enough for me but even if the battery somehow dies you could still use them as passive wired headphones they have a touch sensitive side to control your music without pulling out your phone or you could use voice commands with Alexa Google assistant or Siri and perhaps the coolest feature is conversation mode which uses six mics to pass in all the sound around you to give you superpower hearing so you can actually talk to people without needing to take your headphones off and of course in addition to add phones Bose has speakers such as the s1 here or they're smart portable home speaker both of which are cultura portable after charging I really do love these things and I use them all the time so thanks to votes for making the coolest possible gifts you can give some of this holiday season and thanks to you for watching [Music],18:15

behind the scenes content. Okay, Mrs. Bonaparte, this is it, one last push and we're done. Congratulations! It's a general. Oh, and here comes the
rest of the army now. Did you just say the rest of the army? (fanfare music) History is full of great conquerors many with very impressive origin stories. For example, Alexander The
Great was the son of a king. Julius Caesar came from
an aristocratic family that descended from a goddess. Great conquerors don't usually come from relatively
insignificant families living on impoverished islands,
but as it just so happens that is where our story begins. In the early 18th century, The Island of Corsica was a part of the Republic of Genoa until
one day Corsica said, Hey we're declaring independence
and it's probably not worth your time to try and stop us. So Genoa said, you're right,
it isn't worth our time. Hey France, you want to buy this island? And France said, sure thing. And thus Corsica became
France just in time for Napoleon to be born French. Many Corsicans didn't appreciate
their new conquers however. And from an early age,
Napoleon developed some fairly anti French sentiments. Napoleon's dad, however, quickly embraced his new French overlords which created some tension
between dad and son. Ooh. Look at me. I'm dad. I wear powdered wigs and
silver buckled shoes. And I'm a trader to the Corsican people. Go to your room Napoleon. No, you go to your room, dad. Okay. On the other hand,
Napoleon adored his mother who was definitely the
disciplinarian of the family. And even though she would
punish Napoleon severely, he kind of respected that. But Napoleon's parents wanted
the best for their family. And since they were a very minor nobility they were able to have Napoleon sent off to the shining lights and rat-infested sewage
puddles of the big city. Napoleon went to military
school in France. Okay. Napoleon, why don't
you introduce yourself to your new classmates? Well, I'm Napoleon, and I hate all of you. Your farts smell like cheese. You can't pronounce the letter R. All you do is go on strike. And you call eggs ""oeufs"" like a bunch of big dumb idiot dingleberries. Okay, thanks Napoleon. I hope you like being bullied. And bullied he was. They picked on him for
his Corsican accent, his family's lack of wealth, and it probably didn't help
that he also had a bit of a chip on his shoulder, but
he could hold his own. And on an average day,
might be found dishing out ratatouille sandwiches for breakfast. He spent much of his time
alone, and he loved reading about the great conquerors of history. He learned about Julius
Caesar, and he wondered if one day he too might
have a pizza franchise named after him, (funky music) He excelled at math and geography, and when he graduated at the age of 16, he was made second Lieutenant
in an artillery regiment. Now, Second Lieutenant might
sound pretty sweet to a screw up like you, but
Napoleon had a little something called ambition, stonks of it. And he wasn't content being
just some junior officer. He wanted to rise the ranks. Unfortunately for him, that
would be a little difficult. Well, Napoleon I've
reviewed your application, it's clear you're very skilled and would be a perfect
fit for the promotion. And Simeon, you're just about the
biggest idiot I've ever seen. Your test results suggest
you have the mental aptitude of a senile earthworm. And in the part of the form
where you list your experience, you seem to have drawn
a picture of a gerbil giving birth to a shoe, but your dad is the
Marquis de la Foofayette, so, you get the job. (Simeon screams) French society was just too closed off. Positions were handed out
based on nobility, not talent. And the young Napoleon
probably felt stuck. Wouldn't it be nice if, say,
a revolution came along, and changed all of that? Well, what are the chances? The French revolution is here. Bastille toppling, head
chopping, king popping, the revolution promised to do away with the old social hierarchy and make everyone a little more equal. Napoleon may not have cared
much for the violent mobs, but if it meant he could
rise the ranks, he was in. He began fighting to
defend the revolution. He put down a British
sponsored counter-revolution into Toulon and got promoted. He put down a royalist uprising
in Paris and got promoted. And as his military prowess
became more recognized he was even given his very own army. It was astonishing progress for such a young man of humble origins and Napoleon's wildest
dreams were coming true. But Napoleon also
believed he could increase his social status if he
married an older rich lady. And so around this time,
Napoleon went on the prowl. However, if some sources
are to be believed, he was a verified creep. He reportedly had terrible luck with woman and most wanted nothing to do with him. Fortunately, he eventually met Josephine an aging single mother
who was deeply in debt, and needed stability. So she agreed to marry him, despite finding him intensely disgusting. Napoleon you dirty dog, you've done it. Unbeknownst to Napoleon however, Josephine had a bit of a
promiscuous reputation. Hey Napoleon, I hear
you're marrying Josephine. Boy, she sure is a great kisser. That's right. Hey, wait, what do you
mean she's a great kisser? Hey Hugo! You hear Napoleon's
marrying Josephine? Wow. She sure is a great kisser. Now hang on just a minute. Hey everyone! Napoleon's
marrying Josephine! (crowd talks over each other) Oh for goodness sake, is there anyone here who
hasn't kissed my wife? Yeah, you. (crowd laughs) As Napoleon fell madly in
love with his new wife. She fell madly in love
with a man named Hippolyte. It wouldn't be long however, before Napoleon would
leave home and go to war because while France was
having its revolution, tensions in Europe were rising. Hey Austria, you'll never
guess what we just did. What's that France? I got two words for you, Revo, Lution. We totally just socked it to our monarchy! What, dude, the rest of us are monarchies. You've just totally threatened the balance of power in Europe. Now we have to worry
about our stinky peasants rising up against us. I mean, holy hell your Queen is Okay, France. This is pretty awkward. And the rest of Europe
is probably itching to give you a wedgie, but you're
not ready for a war yet. So you gotta be cool man. It's absolutely crucial that you say something to diffuse
the situation, right now. Preposterous! I declare war. Sacrébleu! So France ended up at war with
basically the rest of Europe, and the war of the first coalition began. At first France struggled, but then they started
to do surprisingly well. And in many conquered territories they began to establish sister republics, exporting their revolutionary
ideas across Europe. In 1796, they planned a
three-pronged attack to take Vienna and knock Austria out of the
war with two magnificent armies in the north to kick ass,
and Napoleon in the south, as a bit of a diversion. For the first time, Napoleon
would lead a military campaign. This was his chance to prove
himself, to be somebody, and what a general, he proved to be. The army he was given were demoralized, lacking equipment, and underpaid, but Napoleon galvanized them
with inspirational speeches. And he took them into Italy. He was outnumbered and
his campaign was partially meant to be a sideshow, but
he made it the main show. While the two Northern
armies were being held back, Napoleon made staggering progress. In a signature Napoleon move, he masterfully split his enemies into two and took them on separately, knocking Sardinia out of the war, and putting the Austrians on the run. At the famous Battle of Lodi, he was in the fray,
aiming the canons himself, getting covered in mud, and earning the total respect of his men. They respected him so much, that when he ordered an
almost suicidal assault on the only bridge in town,
his men threw themselves at it and took it despite fierce
Austrian resistance. For Napoleon, it was
all he needed to confirm that he was the greatest
human who had ever existed. Wow Napoleon, you're pretty
great at this military stuff. Just be careful, your
head doesn't get too big. What did you just say
to me you little prick? And as Napoleon swept
through Northern Italy, the Italians cheered his arrival. Yes! I'm here to liberate you from your cruel Austrian oppressors. And replace them with French ones. Napoleon plundered as he
went, sending riches back to France to help its economy, but also paying his men the first real
money that's seen in years. The Pope had been
supporting the Austrians, so Napoleon briefly went
to go give him a slap. And as he began to approach Vienna, the exhausted Austrians
were forced to make peace, with Napoleon overseeing
negotiations himself. He had just single-handedly
knocked Austria out of the war. And by the way, he was only 28. So maybe it's about time you
moved out of your dad's attic. In the Italian territories
he had conquered, Napoleon established new
French sister republics, even writing constitutions and organizing governments himself. Not something a general generally does. When he got back to France,
he was hailed as a hero and the extremely unpopular
government were concerned he might get some power hungry ideas. So they agreed he should go
far away from France, to Egypt, where he could maybe undermine
British access to India. Napoleon was eager to win more glory. So he brought with him a team of scholars, and he was like, whoa
it's a freaky man cat. Whoa, it's a big stick. Whoa, It's an ugly horse. Whoa, it's a stumpy little manlet. Hey, I'm actually average
height for the time. But then British Admiral Nelson came down and wrecked his fleet. And an Anglo-Ottoman force
defeated him at Acre. So Napoleon abandoned his
men and went back to France. His campaign in Egypt hadn't
gone quite as planned. But one thing you should
know about Napoleon was that he was a skilled propagandist. He published his own
newspapers that sometimes exaggerated his achievements
and even commissioned paintings that generally made him look cool. So when he returned to
Paris, he was yet again, hailed as a hero, and he began to get
some power hungry ideas. First however, he had a bit
of a problem to deal with. See, he had learned something
shocking about his dear wife. Really Josephine, this guy? I'm just as tall as him. I'm sorry. I swear, now that you're becoming famous, I'll never do it again. Make sure you don't. I've never stooped so
low as to cheat on you. Now, if you'll excuse
me, I'll be in this room, consulting my generals
for the next 30 minutes. And by consulting, I mean boinking, by my generals, I mean this woman and by 30 minutes, well
I mean two seconds. Having dealt with his wife,
Napoleon was then approached by a very influential politician,
who said he had an idea. He wanted to stage a
coup against the deeply unpopular government and needed the extremely
popular Napoleon's help. And Napoleon thought that was
just the darn tootin'est idea. The plan was to trap the government and convince them to
voluntarily give up their power. And here's how they did it. Hey guys, oh my gosh, quick! There's a dangerous Jacobin
plot to overthrow you which we definitely aren't just making up. Better get inside this
cage so we can protect you. Okay. Gentlemen, we got them. (cheers) In this case, the cage
was an isolated palace outside of Paris, with no
one around but Napoleon and his army. With the government inside,
Napoleon then entered and a pretty chaotic event ensued. During which, the government
didn't seem entirely sure what was going on, Napoleon's
men didn't seem entirely sure what was going on, and Napoleon himself didn't seem entirely
sure what was going on. But thankfully Napoleon's brother Lucien, President of the Lower House,
managed to regain control and the remaining
councilmen were intimidated into creating a new constitution. And thus, a new government was formed. This time with three Consuls in charge. But after Napoleon did some rewriting, in the end there was really
only one man in charge, the first Consul, him. And over the next few years, he worked to consolidate even more power and essentially became a dictator in total control of France,
who, by the way, he was only 30. So maybe it's about time you washed your disgusting bedsheets. France was now ruled by
possibly the greatest military leader of the time. Possibly the greatest? Or definitely? Well now is his chance to prove it. See, back when Napoleon
was still in Egypt, being Indiana Jones, back
home France was in France, being France. They had conquered even more
territory and they were like hey Piedmont, you get
revolutionary ideals. Hey Switzerland, you get
revolutionary ideals. And Rome, you get revolutionary ideals. Everybody gets revolutionary. Oh, Hey guys, nice sledgehammers, and Naples, very cool nail gun. You guys here to get some
revolutionary ideals? (screams) Sacre bleu! As France was still
spreading the revolution, And with Napoleon busy in Egypt, the European powers felt the
time was right for round two. And the War of the
Second Coalition, began. And this time they're
big, bad boy buddy Russia was here to bang some French
boys back to Bordeaux. And bang them, they did. France, got blasted. But then Russia pulled out
after stalling in Switzerland. And now that Napoleon was
in charge of the country he was ready to start blasting right back. He took command of The Army of the Reserve and he brought the fight to the Austrians. Now, there are many
traits that made Napoleon a great military leader. I already mentioned one of them,
how he was one of the boys, and commanded the total
loyalty of his men. But now we see a second reason,
the element of surprise. In 1800, Napoleon moved to Geneva and it looked like he was
probably going to take on the Austrian forces in Germany. There's no way he'd be crazy enough to move his entire army
south through the Alps as a surprise attack on the
Austrians besieging Genoa. Oh, Napoleon's moving
his entire army south through the Alps as a surprise attack on the Austrians besieging Genoa. Napoleon's crossing of
the Alps, is legendary. And you may have seen one
of the most famous paintings of the general popping a
sick wheelie on his majestic stallion, surrounded by
dangerous mountain terrain. Of course, in real life,
he made the crossing on a depressed mule,
but that's not as cool. When he emerged in Italy,
the Austrians expected him to come break their siege. But Napoleon went for their
supply line near Milan, forcing the Austrians
to meet Napoleon head-on at the famous battle of Marengo. The Austrians initially clobbered
the out-numbered French. And they were like, hooray, we won. But then a few hours later,
Napoleon showed up again with an even bigger army and
he clobbered them right back. Holy cow this tiny little
fun sized French guy is running rings around us. Hey! I'm average height
for the time, you jerk! Then, after General Moreau's
victory at Hohenlinden, Vienna was exposed and the
Austrians again, sued for peace. Just like the war of The First Coalition, the Second Coalition ended
in another French victory. But in many ways they both felt more
like Napoleon victories. Only the UK remained at
war with Napoleon and they were using their powerful
Navy to blockade French ports and were even seizing the
cargoes of neutral ships. Obviously everyone else got pretty pissed off that the British were
interfering with their trade. So in response, they formed a league and they
embargoed the UK right back. Neutral countries protecting
their own interests? That's offensive. So Britain went to Copenhagen
and blew a bunch of stuff up. And the league disbanded. But because UK's economy was pretty bust they decided to sign a
treaty with France in 1802. For the first time in a long
time, Europe was at peace. Congratulations, Sire,
you've achieved peace. Yes, Pierre, but not for long. I still don't trust those dirty Brits. Did you hear they've been

defeating the Austrians, and Europe at peace. What a meteoric rise it had
been for the young Corsican. He had just taken charge of
a nation that appeared to be losing a war and turned it all around, securing French gains in Europe. But there was now a big
question, you see, throughout the chaotic French
revolution, French governments had struggled to keep the economy afloat. They often didn't have
a whole lot of support and they frequently came and went. Would Napoleon finally be the
man who could stick around? Military victories were one thing, but could the general also govern? Spoiler alert, yes. The economy's crumbling? Well then why don't you have
yourself a new national bank, currency reform, and improve
taxation and welfare systems. The legal system is an incoherent mess? Well then why don't we nicely
wrap all those civil laws up into one new centralized legal code? Corrupt government officials?
throw them in the trash. Bad infrastructure? Throw it in the trash. Women's rights? Throw them in the trash. Wait, really? Well, Yeah. Unfortunately,
while Napoleon was building on the equality of the revolution, he also largely scaled back
rights for certain groups and husbands had full legal
control over their wives. But come on ladies, maybe let men have a slice
of the pie for once, okay? Napoleon further reformed education, ensuring a system based
on individual ability. Meaning now, Simeon had to
compete with everyone else and Napoleon could get
the cream of the crop to help him run the Republic. But he wasn't just building on
the ideas of the revolution. The revolution had led to a lot of chaos and Napoleon needed stability. So he rolled back a couple of things. Most notably with religion,
the revolution had pretty much kicked the
Catholic church to the curb, but Napoleon understood
that since many French citizens still considered
themselves Catholic, that could be a problem. So he came to an agreement with the Pope and brought back the church. Only this time with some
pretty hefty power limitations. He also ensured freedom
for other religions and is often noted for
his positive treatment of Jewish people at a time
of widespread antisemitism. But while all of this
may make Napoleon sound like a pretty standup
dude, it's good to note that he believed in religious freedom because he thought it was a
powerful tool to keep the poor from eating the rich,
or something like that. Overall, Napoleon's aim was to end the chaos of the revolution and finally create a stable
and prospering French Republic. And in that aim, he seemed
to be largely successful and generally popular
with the people of France. He officially declared that the revolution is over,
adding I am the revolution. Napoleon's head could be seen for miles. Of course, not everyone was
happy with Napoleon's reforms. Conservatives felt he was too radical. Radicals felt he was too conservative. But since Napoleon was a dictator, opposition could usually be stamped out with some good old fashioned iron fisting. In 1804, Napoleon took
one last major step. After some failed attempts
were made to assassinate him. He wanted to strengthen his position and ensure his dynasty
could live on after him. And so he decided being
First Consul for Life simply wasn't quite enough. He decided he should become Emperor. He held a vote asking the
French people if they were cool with the idea and they
returned to definitely not rigged, 99.9% in favor. The balls on this man. And so in the 2nd of December, 1804, in an elaborate ceremony at Notre-dame, Napoleon was made Emperor. The Pope was even invited to attend and normally he would
crown an Emperor, but to make sure everyone knew this
wasn't some Charlemagne style circular power division,
Napoleon lifted the crown and placed it on his own head. Like I said, the balls on this man. He was now Emperor of the French. Well Napoleon, you were a General, then you became First Consul for Life, And now you're an Emperor. Is it enough yet? Is your ambition finally satisfied? I don't know Pierre,
what comes after Emperor? I would say, God sire. You want to be a God? Yes. I'll put it down under maybe. Okay everyone. What the hell is going on? This Corsican guy showed up out of nowhere and he's kicking our ass! He's exporting the ideas
of the French revolution wherever he goes. And he just declared himself
King of Italy and Emperor. He can't do that, I'm the emperor! Oh, hey fellow monarchs. I see you're having a monarch party. My invite must've got lost in the mail. I'll just set up a spot right here. Wow. You don't belong here, Napoleon. We're coming to take you down. I'd like to see you try. I'm so scared, I just pooed my pants. Hey everyone, I just pooed my pants! (crowd laughing) No, but I did just poo my pants. Before Napoleon had even
declared himself Emperor, the British had already
re-declared war on France, because both sides had been
violating their previous treaty. Napoleon immediately occupied Hanover and then began making plans
for a great British invasion. Partially paid for by
selling a huge chunk of land to the United States. Napoleon gathered his army
along the English channel. But here was the problem, while Napoleon's powerful
army would almost certainly obliterate the British on land, there was very little
chance he'd actually make it across the channel because
Britannia ruled the waves. This power dynamic would keep
the two traditional enemies from engaging in much real direct combat throughout the Napoleonic wars. However, the British had
something else up their sleeves, copious amounts of money. They were willing to throw cash at anyone who would go to war against Napoleon. And there were plenty of
takers, Austria, Russia, Naples and Sweden, hoping to put
Napoleon's France back in its place, formed The Third
Coalition against France. The coalition forces probably thought that this time they stood a chance. They weren't prepared
for the total humiliation they were about to suffer. The War of the Third Coalition
was Napoleon at his best. We've already learned two ways in which Napoleon was a
great military commander but here comes one of the
biggest reasons, speed. He had reorganized his army into corps, which were themselves,
basically small armies. Each had their own infantry,
cavalry and artillery. And as a result was able
to act more independently. They spread out through the
countryside and by living off the land, rather than
relying on heavy supply trains they were able to move extremely quickly. Napoleon would traverse massive distances, outmaneuver his enemies,
isolate them and then move in for the kill before they
even knew what was going on. Lightening warfare, leading
to total destruction. Would you like to see him do it? Here we go. Part of the Coalition's plan
was for the Russians to meet up with the Austrians and
take on Napoleon together. Combined, they could turn
the tide against him. So Napoleon needed to stop
them from ever meeting, but he's all the way over in Bouillon. No problem. In a matter of weeks,
Napoleon marched 200,000 men, in secret, encircling
Austrian general Mack, and capturing his entire army. A devastating blow. Napoleon later remarked, I have destroyed the Austrian
army by simply marching. Next, he turned to face
the approaching Russians. Okay. It looks like the
French are coming for us, but check this out. I've got an amazing idea. When they approach, We run away, Sir, you're a genius. The Russians began to retreat
with Napoleon giving chase. And since his tactics
relied on quick victories, this could be a problem. Especially because the
longer the war went on, the more likely it looked other countries may join
the coalition against him. But Napoleon knew the Russians are Alexander The First, who
was young and seeking glory. So he came up with an idea to lure him in. He sent him a message. What does it say? It says, hello. I'm
just a little baby boy, and I'm very scared. Are you talking like that, or is he? He is, sir. Why's he doing that? I don't know, but it's very
cute, helpless, and vulnerable. A little baby boy. Very scared. Cute? Boris, get my crossbow,
we're going hunting. The Allied forces turned to face Napoleon, who they now believed was
in a vulnerable position. He was set up at Austerlitz and to make it look
like he was retreating, he had even evacuated the high ground. A thick fog set in,
obscuring Napoleon's center, as the Allies took the bait
and set up on the heights. From there, they spotted Napoleon's very
weak looking right flank. And they descended the
Heights to go get it. Little did they know, it was exactly what Napoleon
was hoping they'd do. The next thing they knew, a
large French force was emerging from the fog, launching a huge
central assault up the hill. They swung around crushing the allies. And as men attempted to flee
across the frozen lakes, Napoleon ordered his
artillery to fire on the ice, causing an unknown number to drown. But he told me he was just a
little baby boy, what happened? He tricked you, sir. You mean I was the little
baby boy all along? It was Napoleon's masterpiece. And Austria were once again forced to make peace with France. Then, with the French
conquest of Naples in 1806, The War of the Third Coalition ended as yet another Napoleon victory. This was the third time
Napoleon had had to give Austrian Emperor
Francis a good spanking. And so with the peace treaty in 1805, Napoleon was determined to punish him. He was forced to give up territory, hand over significant compensation, and promised never to
fight Napoleon again. For now Russia, Sweden, and the UK remained at war with France but none were able to
offer much of a threat. And so Napoleon got to work strengthening his grip over Europe. He gave out rule of captured territories to his family and friends. And most notably, he
established a new Confederation in Germany with himself as its protector. Seeing his influence in
Germany being wiped away, Emperor Francis acknowledged reality, and officially dissolved
the holy Roman empire. An entity that had existed
for over a thousand years. But it wasn't all good news for Napoleon. For one thing, Spain had earlier
allied with France in 1804, because the British just
couldn't help themselves from blowing up Spanish ships. And Napoleon hoped the
combined French-Spanish fleet would eventually be
able to invade England. Unfortunately, he received word
that British Admiral Nelson had engaged his fleet at Trafalgar. Normally Naval battles looked
like this, but in this case, Nelson did this? Was it because he was an idiot? No, it's because he was a genius. He successfully punched through
the Franco-Spanish line, and unleashed hell. His victory ensured British
control of the sea and his death during the battle made him a legend. Napoleon's hopes for a future
British invasion, were gone. But not just that, Napoleon
was also hoping to secure peace on the continent, but
that wasn't looking likely because the Prussian king was
under pressure from his wife. Frederick, he's established
a Confederation in our turf, and he told us he'd give us Hanover but then offered it to the British. You have to declare war on him. What is it with you and war? What is it with you and being a cupcake? Go to war. Okay. In October 1806, Prussia, with its famed military
tradition joined the Coalition, and declared war beginning the
War of the Fourth Coalition. Unfortunately, Prussian King
Frederick William the Third, Wasn't the smartest tool in the shed. Look at him over there. Being all French, makes me sick! Boys, will get him this time. But here's the thing, this
time we have to stick together. Do not, under any circumstances,
face Napoleon by yourself. You all saw what happened to Austria. Hey, where'd Fred go? Hey you jerk, think you're
some kind of big shot, huh? Want to tango with Fred? You don't got the cajones. We're screwed. Without consulting its allies, Prussia had gone ahead and
sent Napoleon an ultimatum, Demanding he move all his
forces out of Germany. Now some of you watching this video, probably can't even wipe
your own bum bum yet, but even you know, you don't just send Napoleon an ultimatum. Obviously, Napoleon went in for the kill. Prussia's army was quite outdated. So when they met Napoleon
at the twin battles of Jena and Auerstedt,
it wasn't even close. Even Marshall Davout's heavily
outnumbered corp at Auerstedt sent the Prussians running
and Napoleon carried out a ruthless pursuit of his
fleeing enemy, taking Berlin. And within a single month,
decimating the Prussian forces. Frederick William, and
the remnants of his army, moved to the east. At this point, Napoleon's
forces were pretty tired. Winter had come and
conditions were miserable. He anticipated both sides would
settle into winter quarters, but Russia decided to try their hand at an unexpected winter attack. A series of brutal battles
followed that took a heavy toll on both sides, including
the vicious Battle of Eylau, fought in blizzard conditions. Men froze to death, and many deserted. The Russian artillery
tore the French to shreds, and Napoleon himself was momentarily under risk of being captured. In the end, the French army was saved, thanks to a legendary cavalry charge by Napoleon's flamboyant
cavalry commander, Murat. After the horror inflicted on both sides, they decided it might
be a good idea not to do any more fighting until after winter. Then after winter came
and the fighting continued the Russians were pushed
back to Friedland, where Russian general Bennigsen
made a bit of a blunder by positioning himself with
the aloe river to his back. The French artillery were
able to pin the Russians between the river and
their concentrated gunfire. A major element in
Napoleon's fighting style and many Russians drowned
as they tried to escape. War of the Fourth Coalition,
victory, Napoleon. (dramatic music)",29:42

LHx63zUMLpM,About To Eat,Food,Using A $329 Toaster For 30 Days,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHx63zUMLpM,7 months ago,892K views,Food,hello everyone this is inca as some of you know i really love bread we're the right top for this occasion i eat bread basically every day but i do not own a toaster and i usually either eat my bread fresh or i would toast it over a pan on the stovetop which i feel like gives me a similar result but some time ago i heard about this very special toaster that apparently makes better toast in a way where you can actually taste the difference also it has a very very expensive price tag of 300 which is crazy that's a lot of money for a toaster but i really wanted to see for myself if that was true so i brought it home with me to spend some time with it get to know each other a little bit better to see if we're a good match i also want to say that this is not an ad it was not gifted i bought this toaster because i wanted to try it out and make a video about it it's been a little over a month now my relationship with this very special and expensive toaster before i go into how it's been so far i feel like i should at least try to explain a little bit of why it is so expensive so you know how usually when you use toasters it does crisp up the bread but it kind of dries it out a specific toaster avoids that by using the steam cooking method where you're going to pour water into like this little slot on top which then goes into the toaster oven the heat creates this steam that helps seal in the moisture and the flavor of the bread before crisping it up with additional heat so as a result you get this beautiful golden brown color on the outside and that like really soft fluffy texture on the inside so it's all very scientific even though i will say when i unboxed this what really caught my eye was just the design of it it just looked so cute it also comes with this tiny little cup which you use to pour in the water i was very worried i was going to lose it it also came with this manual which kind of goes through what each setting is but even if you lose this the instructions are actually on the oven itself also really love these little symbols around the dial here each one of them stand for a different kind of mode somebody who lives in new york and has a relatively tiny kitchen i did not have enough counter space so what i did was actually put it on top of my movable table here it does get kind of hot to touch so i made sure it had its own personal space you would think the first thing i make is a piece of toast right since that's what it's known for but no i think i just got over excited and i decided to make a croque monsieur makes absolutely no sense but i think i just had all the ingredients at home i just bought like a pumpernickel loaf from my favorite bakery so i just built that together a slice of bread some sauce some ham some cheese double that layer and i popped it in the oven on pizza mode because that's the mode you're supposed to use for toast with toppings i really also just love the sound the turn dial makes like the little clock ticking and then the little thing at the end when the bread is done [Music] i can also hear it from my room which is really nice so that i know when to come and get my bread and you know what it turned out pretty well the cheese was bubbling on top it was all melted and gooey the bread wasn't as crisp as i wanted it to be but i think that's also because i was very ambitious in terms of everything else i was pretty pleased it was really cool kind of being able to experiment right off the bat with a sort of like open face sandwich situation this is like the first of 30-something items i tested in the toaster of and so it is quite the uh it is going to be quite the journey after being super adventurous on my first try i decided to explore the sandwich bread mode a little bit more sandwich bread mode is basically the toast mode your average sliced bread the first couple slices of sandwich bread i toasted was actually frozen specifically a frozen sourdough loaf that's actually how i usually store fresh bread preheating these frozen slices of bread is actually part of my morning routine this is what i eat for breakfast it was very exciting to see the difference where when i toasted these in the toaster oven the bread did have that like fluffiness i missed from when i would toast it over the pan it was definitely more moist the texture was also chewy i did also experiment with more like a country bread style type of loaf which i toasted on the artisan bread mode which actually gives it an even crispier exterior so you see that like browning around the edges i think i actually burnt it a little bit in the beginning i think it just sat there for too long but less alert did not do that again but interestingly enough no matter how crisp the outsides will get the inside will always be just as soft and fluffy which i really appreciated and really i just enjoyed these first couple slices with the usual things avocado ricotta and honey or you know just butter crisp on the outside the mouth feel was just so good but i think what is the most fascinating is how the lights go on and off and on and off i think that's the sort of like precise heat control they're known for also the steam like how it just slowly spreads across the window and it was just like working its magic that was pretty cool that's like free entertainment right there for me i could just watch that i also did try testing two pieces of toast at the same time i don't think there was a big difference in toasting one slice at a time and toasting two slices so that was great because then from now on i could just make sandwiches and toast them both at the same time but then i also toasted some cheesecake danish and cheesecake babka both of which are very buttery type pastries and i should have used it on pastry mode but i actually ended up toasting these on just like sandwich bread mode which is why you'll see round around the edges but because of the moisture from the steam i have to say the babka was almost like you know when you get like a fresh like brioche bun buttery softness and i want to say the vodka had been sitting in my fridge for like maybe three to four days and it really just like resuscitated it i think the danish got a little bit burnt that's when i learned the hard way that using the right setting for the right type of bread really does matter because as i was trying to figure it out i toasted an old baguette and a chocolate croissant on sandwich bread mode instead of pastry mode r.i.p i don't know what i was thinking they both ended up being very burnt no i still ate them anyways after scraping off the top but yeah the right setting really does matter also if the bread or pastry is too tall it will get burnt because it's too close to the heat source i only saw afterwards that apparently can't be taller than 2.2 inches i did turn my burnt bagel into a burnt bagel sandwich though and it was very good even though the outside is crisp and burnt the inside is still chewy soft which i thought was just amazing i also tried toasting a waffle a frozen waffle i ended up toasting this waffle twice because i felt like there wasn't enough color but i actually think once was enough in the end it wasn't as soft as i normally like to enjoy these but yeah i think for toaster waffle the difference wasn't that big for me but before i move on though of course i eventually got milk bread and when i tell you that it was possibly the best piece of toast i've ever had there is no exaggeration it was really just perfection like i think this is what i think of when i think of the perfect toast because even though regular toasters do give bread that sort of like crispiness on the outside by giving it crispiness it takes away some of that moisture so the bread becomes a little more dried out whereas this toaster oven actually tries to preserve that sort of springiness so it really is that beautiful golden crispiness on the outside and then that soft fluffy slightly chewy springiness on the inside i added butter here for b-roll purposes but honestly for the ones i had afterwards the many pieces of bread i had afterwards i just ate it straight up i just i can't go back to toasting my bread on a pan so at this point on my journey too i've already experimented with a lot of things i wanted to just give the toaster oven a little bit of a cleaning because the crumbs were starting to collect one thing i dreaded about having a toaster was not knowing how to clean it properly it's actually a really simple thing there's a tray at the very bottom where the crumbs collect that you can just pull out brush the crumbs off give it a wipe and then just simply slide it back in the little parts inside some of them are also removable which makes it very easy for me to kind of go in with like a little damp cloth to wipe it down i'm glad i am able to keep it clean now that i've started getting a hang of like sandwich bread mode and artisan bread mode i decided to delve into hasty mode a little bit more since i've obviously been neglecting it when i should have been using it so i bought a very nice looking croissant from a french bakery i ate a little bit of it the day of but then i wanted to reheat it the next day this is probably one of the things i looked forward to the most because this toaster is most famous for reheating croissants in a way that makes it taste like it just came right out of the oven they were not bluffing you know how when it's a day owed it kind of firms up a little bit and when i took it out of the toaster oven it was so flaky and so buttery and it just smelled so good i think that was probably one of the most like eye-opening moments for me because i feel like we usually struggle with reheating croissants crisp on the outside and that like butteriness on the inside that to me was a moment where i was like okay i kind of get it now but part of me was also like how much of this is because of the croissant itself so i went ahead and got a normal croissant just like from my local supermarket and honestly the results were just as mind-blowing so i really do think it's not too much of a reach to say that this toaster oven has the ability to make even a regular croissant taste very expensive also i found out that pastry mode is the mode you're supposed to use to reheat baguettes of course i have to put that to the test because baguettes are my most favorite type of bread and the only reason i had leftover baguettes was because i bought two the day before and i finished one in a day what i really wanted to test out with the baguettes though was the three different types of methods they have specified each of these have a very different texture the one that's in a block cut it is crisp on the outside but it's much softer on the inside compared to the other two whereas for the crosswise they're very very crisp throughout still a little bit chewy on the inside the one slice lengthwise to me was the most interesting because it was crispy but almost also airy in a way it's not like a hard crunchy crisp and more of like a chewy crisp i don't know which one i prefer yet i think it depends on what i want to enjoy with different from the croissant the re-toasted baguette can't really compare to the one fresh out of the oven i have to clarify though that this baguette was two days old so it was a little stale and it is just hard as a rock so that difference alone i think is very impressive once i realized how amazing this pastry mode was i kind of just went a little crazy and started warming up everything a blueberry scone which was dry and hard when i put it in but it was soft and crumbly when i pulled it out oh my god it smells so good [Music] smells like a bakery i also warmed up a banana danish so good so flaky i also warmed up some cookies and that was i think one of the best decisions it came out so soft it's warm and when i broke it the chocolate was like ooey gooey melted with a slight chew you know that feeling you get when somebody mentions like warm cookies right out of the oven at grandma's home that was the feeling i got part of what makes pastry mode so great is it's almost comparable to a microwave oven in terms of like efficiency and how fast it can warm things up you don't have to preheat it and whereas microwave oven tends to dry out pastry mode combined with the steam technology it still retains that moisture warms up the bread and doesn't brown it but at the very end it actually does add a little bit of that crisp back into it this is the reason why i decided to use this 300 toaster oven to reheat my leftover deodo chicken nuggets because i was really craving chicken nuggets the night before and i bought the 20-piece box so i had some leftover the next day and i decided to just you know experiment a little bit these nuggets turned out like i had just bought them they were crispy on the outside the meat was tender on the inside wow it does make me want to experiment a lot more with deep fried foods so that is definitely on the agenda for the future the other mode that i was very excited about was the pizza mode i really wanted to see if this toaster could reheat leftover pizza better than the way we would usually do it so i bought a slice from joe's pizza which is one of my go-to's here the only problem is chose pizza slices are really big this toaster oven is not that big so i ended up having to cut it into a smaller slice and i was watching it through the window the entire time watching that cheese melt the sausage and the pepperoni kind of crisp up it really did feel like again i just pulled pizza fresh out of the oven and when i tried to fold the pizza a little bit you can actually hear how crisp the crust is and when i bit into it almost everything was perfect from the crust to the toppings to the cheese i really just don't think i've ever had leftover pizza that good i also reheated some bagels came out perfect a perfect golden brown made some open-faced sandwiches like this cheese and ham sandwich as well as this egg and cheese one with a little bit of peppers for decoration for both of these the bread was just still so fluffy and so tender underneath really just shocked at how good that balance was now that i've kind of dabbled into all of the four specific modes that this toaster has i wanted to experiment a little bit with the oven mode which honestly for me i was like oh i don't know if i'll use this as much because i do have my conventional oven but i wanted to kind of compare a little bit and see if there was a difference i baked and roasted a couple different things like roasted some cauliflower which is a pretty standard side vegetable for me it actually came out pretty decent i don't think there was a big difference i did kind of fill up the baking tray the amount is limited which is what happened when i tried to bake some scallops which again turned out pretty okay the only thing was i couldn't bake too many at the same time i also baked some ready-made pastry dough this was a frozen chocolate croissant i think it was a little more firm than i expected the inside was just as good so not bad but then because last week i was making some chocolate chip cookies to bring over to my friend's apartment i decided to do a little side-by-side comparison of baking the same dough first thing i will say though the toaster oven only has three heat settings for oven mode i needed to bake my cookies at a lower temperature at 325 so i ended up just baking them at 350. the cookies baked in the conventional oven has more of a spread whereas the toaster oven is almost like smaller and taller the cookies baked in the toaster oven is also crunchier crispier versus the soft chewiness of the conventional oven cookies again it may have to do with the difference in heat temperature i personally much prefer the texture the conventional oven gives me so i think this is the part where the toaster oven fell short a little bit so pretty much at this point i've played around with all the different kinds of modes so i decided to just go a little bit out there with experimentation and just try different things a lot of you asked if you could make a grilled cheese with this the answer is yes you can it's actually on the back of this instruction manual here i buttered up both sides of the bread and i shaved some truffle gouda because truffle gouda was on sale one side definitely turned out more brown than the other the side facing the top right you can see that it's like really crispy whereas the other side you don't see that much browning going on so i actually think the best way to make grilled cheese in this toaster oven specifically might be to flip it halfway through even though it is crisp to the point of being burnt on the outside the inside is still fluffy as ever it's just you can't go wrong all the way you will always be halfway right so i made some roast beef which is actually a recipe provided by the brand itself you cook this on pastry mode so after searing the beef on all sides i toasted it in the toaster oven for 10 minutes i don't even know if toasting is the right word but basically i'm warming it up and then after that's done i let it rest in the toaster oven for another 10 minutes without turning the heat on and i honestly was just so surprised at how it turned out when i sliced into it it was tender the color was beautiful so this is one of the unexpected findings i had i would have never known that i'd be able to make roast beef in this toaster oven on pastry mode no less i also made some pasta put some mozzarella cheese on top and decided to go with the pizza mode setting instead of the regular oven mode to melt the cheese because i remembered how pizza mode has that stronger heat source on the top almost like a boiler it melted it wonderfully i got that beautiful cheese pool and i was just so delighted at how it turned out that's what gave me the idea of boiling fish in the toaster oven boiling fish is actually one of my favorite ways to make fish currently put my fish in let it cook for around 10 minutes and i have to say this is one of those things that turned out even better than broiling it in a traditional oven i think the steam really helped the fish stay tender and as somebody who grew up eating steamed fish i just really enjoyed that texture because steam fish has this sort of bounce to it that you can't really replicate in a lot of other methods and i guess because of this combined function with the steam and the crisping going on i got the best of both worlds so yeah that's my 30 days with this wonderful toaster and again thinking back on you know just why it's so expensive the steaming function alone is something that i think really makes it stand out it does deliver on its promise and also just personally for me i really enjoyed the pastry mode function it really is able to do something that other alternatives cannot achieve you are limited in the amount you can make you can't bake like a batch of cookies and again it is a very high price but if you're like me and you love bread a lot good bread really does bring me a lot of joy then i think it could be a good fit i don't know if i need a 300 toaster in my life but this is something i want it has given me a lot of happiness this past month now that i have it you'll probably see it in a lot more videos from now on i hope this was helpful to some of you if you've been thinking about getting one but otherwise i will see you guys next time bye you,19:44

NQcwgZbgLj4,The Try Guys,"Entertainment,Blog",The Try Guys Cook Bagels Without A Recipe,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQcwgZbgLj4,2 years ago,12M views,"Entertainment,Blog","- I'm a baker! - This is maybe both illegal
and kind of unethical. - [Narrator] We're back in
the Try Guys Test Kitchen. - We have a whole season
of Without A Recipe. - The show where amateur bakers
try and make normal dishes without a recipe, without
ingredients, and without hope. I'm a master baker! - Can you make that joke every bit? - No, but it sounds fun. And it cuts well in the cold open. (dinging) (dramatic music) - [Narrator] Welcome
back to the Try Kitchen for another episode of Without a Recipe. - [Eugene] I'm definitely
losing this video. - [Narrator] This week, bagels! Will they bake a disaster, or will they make a hole in one? (yelling) - Shit, that looks like a bagel, y'all. - [Narrator] Each of the
guys will have two hours to bake a bagel of their choice and present it to our panel of judges. (sustained beeping) - [Eugene] Put your gloves on, Zach. - It was my forearm. - Welcome to Without a Recipe: Bagels. I'm Jamie, and I'm qualified to judge these boys on their bagels, because I eat bagels all the time. - I'm Jessica. I'm a restaurant consultant, marketing. I kind of do this professionally, judge. - I'm J.D. I'm the co-owner of Belle's Bagels. - I'm Nick. I'm the other owner and
chef at Belle's Bagels. Bagels are the ultimate comfort food. A bad bagel, to me, is something that resembles bread more than a bagel. I love a crisp, bubbly, dark crust. When you bite into a bagel, you wanna kind of be able to pull away. You want that pull. During college, I had worked
at a Jewish delicatessen. Kind of realized that there was a dearth of really high-quality
bagels in Los Angeles. So I started baking them. We make about 4,000 bagels a week. During the process of
fermentation, boiling, and baking, we weigh everything out to the nth degree. If you took my scale away from me, I'd be kinda lost. I'm really interested to see how people make a bagel without a recipe. - Bagels, I don't know what I'm doing. I think bagels, you have
to boil them, right? You have to boil them,
and then you bake them. - I'm not good at this. I've really made borderline
poison twice now. But bagels, if you don't know, it's the Jewish national food. It's our thing, man. I feel like this is my birthright. It's not going to Israel. It's making a bagel. - Over the last year, I've started developing a hobby of making bread. I've never made bagels. That's, like, a different type of bread? Maybe this can be my thing. Maybe I'll be the bagel
king of Los Angeles. - I'm gonna boil my bagels
in a shit ton of beer. When I did bread, I used
beer instead of water, and it turned out pretty great. - The judges were wrong. He shouldn't have won that episode. - Maybe it'll enhance the flavor, or maybe it'll taste disgusting. I don't know. But I hope we got enough
beer to fill an entire pot. - I'm very excited. Bagels are one of my favorite foods. - This is very culturally
significant for you. - This is like if we
were doing kimchi, right? - I have a question. What's in this bowl that says, ""Keith""? - Our producer, Rachel,
also made us starters. - Oh, this is a starter. - [Ned] Yeah that we can use. - Oh, yeah, it smells yeasty. - [Nick] All right, bakers. 3, 2, 1. Try to bake! - Oh, it's just starting now? - Oh, oh, it's starting, okay. Today, I'm making sesame bagels. They're my favorite type of bagels. And in my opinion, the best type of bagel. - I'm pretty sure that bread is two parts flour, one part water. I'm looking at Ned. He wasn't totally freaked
out by those stats, so I'm gonna go with it. Bagels are awesome. Poppy seed, everything, garlic. But you know what the best bagel is? Cinnamon raisin bagels. You know why? Cause I'm lactose intolerant, and cinnamon raisin bagels
already have enough flavor where I don't need anything on them. - For me, and without a recipe, I'm always about expanding the horizons of what we know about cooking. So I'm gonna put everything that I usually put into
like my own stir-fries and put it in the bagel
and see what happens. I've never seen a bagel like that. - The bagels are better
in New York for one reason and one reason only. Water. Tap water from New York. The finest water in all the world. - Where did you get that from? - My sister brought it when she visited. - You made your sister fly you tap water? - Yeah.
- From like her sink? - He brought water from New York? Are you for real? - I'm gonna be making an
everything bagel today. I don't care about most things. But today, this matters to me. - [Narrator] First, the
bakers will have half an hour to make their dough. - Okay, okay. I don't know what I'm doing. - You wanna start with your pre-ferment. It's a mixture of flour, water, and yeast. - Rachel, our producer, made us this. I'm not using it. We made bread once, and my
mistake was overcomplicating it. I don't know what this is. I'm not touching it. - This starter that Rachel
made seems so legit. So we're just gonna add
some of this in there. Oh, yeah, look at that. Now we just gotta add a
fuck ton of flour, right? - So right now, we're
gonna make the dough, which involves high-gluten flour, salt, sugar, yeast,
malt powder, and water. - Salt! And sugar. Okay, I'm gonna do a
half teaspoon of yeast. Maybe you need oil too. - So if you're gonna
incorporate your flavors into your dough, you would do that during the mixing phase. - My dad eats Raisin Bran every day. He's the most regular man on the planet. - What's going on? - I'm shaving my ginger. - [Zach] Is that ginger? - Yeah. - I'm gonna get my bread flour, as well as some whole wheat flour. I might've already made several mistakes, cause I'm just making bread. - Do you think it'd be a mistake to add some Korean chili to my dough? - Almost definitely, but go for it, dude. - Drunk Asian. This is definitely a
mistake, but I'm doing it. - There's something about
bagels that they like taste, eh, they taste like a
bagel, you know what I mean? - You're right. I'm gonna put baking soda in mine. - [Zach] I'm just making a bunch
of different types of dough at different intensities
to see which one works. - [Eugene] Molasses,
that was probably wrong. (singing) Needs more beer. - Oh my god. You're being a real Zach over there. - Bagels are a low-hydration bread, so you really don't
wanna add too much water. - I think mine's too wet. It's so wet. - Oh, this already feels very wrong. - Mine's a little salty. - [Nick] What you're really looking for is something that isn't too sticky. You want something that is just overall smooth and consistent. - We've been kneading forever. I need to (bleeped out)
not lose video, Eugene. - That feels just like an ass. - Okay, I'm not, yeah,
see, I didn't wanna say it, but, like, it really does. Like, it's a really good butt. - Once the dough has been kneaded fully, we're gonna let the dough
proof, or ferment, for an hour. - One hour of proofing. Let's cut to a cute animal. There's always a cute
animal in our videos. - Oh, what animal should
we choose this time? - For bagels? - Yeah. Let's cut to some Jewish
children playing in a field. (both laughing) - Do you think they have
stock images of that? (exciting music) - [Narrator] After an hour of proofing, it's time for the bakers
to check their dough and roll their bagels. - Uh, yeah, let's check it out. This is the moment of proof. - [Zach] Okay, I have three
shots to get this right. - [Eugene] Oh, Jesus,
you have so many bowls. - Wow. - I think mine grew, yeah? - Let's see. - I don't know. Yours looks bigger. - Mine's grew a little bit. Yeah, grew a little bit. - I don't know, I don't think mine grew. - Whoa, Eugene! Yours really rose! Oh, shit, dude! - Oh, no, what did I do? It's so big! - Is that bad? - It's bad, I think. - It looks great! - It's so big! - Wow, it really, that was one hour. It's gonna keep growing. - Mine's so porous. Oh, there it comes. - [Zach] Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god! - Just, uh... (both laughing) (dough plopping) - It's alive! - [Zach] Wow. - So there are a couple different ways to shape a bagel. - Since I am a bread maker, I'm shaping them all like
little loaves of bread. See? And now to bagelify it. Ha! - [Nick] You can roll it into
a ball, punch your finger through the middle, and roll it out. - There you go, bagel. - [Nick] Or you can roll
it into a long snake and connect the two ends. - This is just like I'm handling flesh, like human flesh. - There's no consistency to my technique. I'd argue there's no technique. - I'm just focused on trying to make these little dough bones into braided bagel shapes. - But the real way to do it is to roll it into an 11- to 12-inch log, wrap it around the back of your hand, seal it against the table with your hand, and there you go. That's a hand-rolled
bagel right there, baby. - [Narrator] Five minutes left, bakers. - Come on, Ned. You gotta (bleeped out) go. - Shoot! - Yours are cool looking. Honestly, I-- - [Eugene] Fat bagels. - I'm impressed and
surprised that both of ours are holding their shapes. - Look! This is a Panera bagel. You know what I'm talking about? I didn't grow up in New York. I grew up in places with Panera. - Final dough ball. - Yes, Ned! Ooh, Ned, you've got this! Whirling dervish, there it is. Yes, nice, Ned, okay. 3, 2, 1. I feel, you know, they look like bagels, and I also don't know what
the (bleeped out) I'm doing, so I'm pretty confident at
this point, I would say. - [Narrator] After leaving their creations to rest overnight, the bakers return to the test kitchen to boil and bake. - I kind of feel like I know
what to do from here on out. - This is your episode to lose. - They look, um. Mine look exactly the same. If I remember was what I wanted. - They're a little flat right now, but I think I can just
plump them up with my hands. - Wow, those are some meaty boys. - [Eugene] These are too big. Oh, those are even bigger! - Oh, they're wet. - [Eugene] They look highly unappetizing. - Okay, let's see what I've got. It doesn't seem like they rose so much. Fuuuuck. - Well, I guess. - [Zach] Oh, that's just dough. - [Eugene] Not much hole. Well there's some hole action. (extended beeping) - Oh, no, Eugene. Uh oh. - [Eugene] Do you remember
which ones were which? - [Zach] Doesn't matter. - [Eugene] These seem like they
have a similar consistency. - [Zach] Doesn't (bleeped out) matter. - [Eugene] Well, try those. Maybe there's some, remember you had three different batches. - (yelling) Oh, no! What can I do? I can't do anything with this. - Yeah, you can. - What are you talking about, Eugene? It's just dough! - This has the New York waters in it. - [Zach] (screaming) No! This is garbage. - [Eugene] You gotta make the hole-- - What the (bleeped out)
am I gonna do with this? Are they supposed to be so doughy? Was everyone else's so doughy? - Putting a little bit
of butter on the top, just so they have a nice shine. - It's gonna be really, like, an artisanal, natural bagel. - I admire how uniform yours are. - Ooh, Ariel wants to FaceTime me. Hey, hon. (screaming) (screaming echoing) (bleeped out) - I just, are they
supposed to be so gooey? I thought that they would've
solidified a little bit. - If it helps, mine feel very gooey. What's your game plan? - I don't have one anymore. I think, I don't think
that I can do anything. - It's your (bleeped out) water, man. - [Nick] The most obvious difference between a bagel and other bread is that bagels are boiled. - Maybe that's what gives
it the special flavor. - We're gonna get our water boiling, and you can use beer, honey,
malt syrup, baking soda. - [Eugene] I'm gonna fill
up the whole pot with beer. - Oh, wow. - Depending on which two you put into your water at one time, you can create some pretty gross flavors. - Iodized sea salt, baking
soda, and just some raisins. - Ariel told me to put vinegar in there. - Vinegar? - When you put them in, you wanna make sure that
they float right away. That means that they've proofed enough. If they sink to the bottom, that means they're underproofed. - You all ready, you ready? You ready to watch this? - I'm gonna watch yours, I guess. (both yelling) - [Zach] I don't know
if that was good or bad! It's floating, it's like a little boat. - How long do I keep these in here? My beer almost smells like soy sauce. - We got a rolling boil, let's go! - And we're gonna boil our bagels for around a minute and a half per side. - I'm boiling it for 120 seconds. It looks horrible. - Think I'll boil mine until it floats. I'll do like pasta style. - Your boiling time directly correlates with the thickness of
the crust on your bagel. If it's a longer boiling time, you get a much thicker crust. - It looks like a wrinkly old dick. Sorry, it looks like an old dick. - You know, how old
dicks turn into circles. - Out of the boil, that's when
you can add your toppings. - I'm trying to do a gochugaru, furikake, sesame oil, onion blend. I'm putting eggs on mine because
this is like my fried rice, and I'm just gonna put eggs on it. I'm gonna put some more spice on it. Have you ever had an Asian bagel? - Not this one. - I'm brushing sesame oil on top. That'll just add to
everything that's going on. - I just got this melted butter over here, and I'm like, ""Wish we had some lobster."" God, I love lobster. - Now it's time for the sesame seeds. Yes, sesame seeds. Season at a distance! Oh, sassy. It's snowing sesames today. Think I need even more sesame seeds. - There's so many sesame
seeds on there, Ned. - [Ned] (bleeped out) that. It's not enough sesame seeds. - [Narrator] While three of the bakers finish their final seasonings, Zach still waits for
his first bagel to boil. - I've been able to
re-establish some holes. - [Eugene] That looks nice. - Thanks, man. I'm gonna let this one go for a minute, and then check in and see how it goes. My plan from there is
to immediately dip it in the toppings, and then I'm done. And I'm hoping that that's enough for the ingredients to stick. This is stressful. I'm stressed out. I don't enjoy this show. Like everything is riding
on this decision, right? Cause if that's not
how the things stay on, and it just falls off, then I have a nothing bagel. Then I have plain bagels. - [Eugene] Ooh! - [Zach] Yes. - [Eugene] Oh, you do both sides. - Yes, and I'm gonna just-- - [Eugene] That looks, you can't even tell the shape it weird. - Dude, dude!
- I think you did it. - Dude! - You just gotta cover everything. - That's a thing! - [Eugene] Your parents are
gonna be so proud of you. - Ow, (bleeped out). - [Eugene] What are all the ingredients on your everything bagel? - I've got poppy seeds, minced
onion, garlic, sesame seeds. I don't personally like
too much sesame, you know? I think too much sesame
really overpowers the flavor, so sparingly. ♪ It's snowing ♪ ♪ It's snowing ♪ ♪ All the sesame seeds ♪ ♪ It's snowing ♪ ♪ It's snowing sesame seeds ♪ - But if you did it lower, they probably wouldn't bounce, right? - No, they still bounce. - [Eugene] All right, bagel time. - [Zach] Bagel time. - Once you've topped
them with your toppings you can put them into a 500-degree oven for about 18 minutes. - My impulse would be that you do this for about 20 minutes. - How much are you thinking? - I'm thinking 12. - Wow, yours, something's
going on with yours. Ow, fuck. - Zach. - Once I see any black on any of them, they're all coming out. - Oh, yeah, I got oil all over them. They're definitely
cooking and frying right. - [Zach] They're gonna have
like a nice, crisp bottom. - Or burnt. - You wanna pull them out of the oven when they're golden-brown all around. - How dark are bagels? I can't remember. (sizzling) (extended bleeping) - [Eugene] Put your gloves on, Zach. - [Zach] It was my forearm! This is a fool me once, shame on me thing. - Eight minutes. I think I wanna take mine out. - Okay, I'm gonna pull mine out. - Okay, and then while this is open, I'm gonna do a toothpick test on mine. Ah, shit. - [Eugene] Oh, my god, Zach. - [Zach] Ah shit, ah shit. - Wow, wow, I'm a baker! They look like bagels! Oh, my god! - My bagels have been
cooking for 12 minutes. I'm doing it. I'm pulling them out. - It's perfect, it's perfect. - (together) We made bagels! We made bagels! (yelling and cheering) - Oh, my god, they look so cute! - [Eugene] All right, I think we did it. High-five. - Oh, my god. The toothpicks, I slipped on them. Dude, we might've just made bagels. - Our criteria for judging these bagels are going to be taste, presentation, creativity, and is it a bagel? - The first thing I look for in a bagel is a solid crust, good chew to
it, seed coverage, you know. But I think what we're looking for today is something that is mostly edible. - [Jessica] Any sweet bagels? Can bagels be sweet? - Uh, no, but muffins can. In my mind, cinnamon raisin
bagels aren't actually bagels. - I'm excited to see if
we can call it a bagel. - Baking is like the most precise
thing in the entire world, so I fully expect this to
be entirely disastrous. (coos) - Okay, first up, you have Zach's everything bagel. I have been eating bagels all my life. They are one of my favorite foods. I'm a New York Jew, and
this means a lot to me. So it is with great
pride and great pleasure that I present to you my Poppy Thang bagel. I do hope you enjoy. - That was good, that was really good. - Thank you, thank you. - [Jessica] It's really dark. - [Zach] Yes, that's the poppy. - Great seed coverage. It does smell like an everything bagel. - [Jessica] Yeah. - [Nick] You have that. - That's huge. - [Nick] This is called the crumb shot. - Crumb shot?
- I know, right? (all exclaiming) - Oh, shit! Oh, shit. I mean, oh, darn. - It does look like a bagel. Your yeast was active. It's mostly baked. Shall we see how it tastes? - Wet, salty. - Very salty. - Really salty.
- Really salty. - Salty and wet. - Really like, not just salt-like flavor. - Wow. - It's very salty. - It's salty and garlicky.
- It's salty. - Like the garlic comes
out stronger from the salt. - I think I oversalted. - Your dough is extremely salty. - Yeah.
- Just try it. - [Jessica] Yeah. - So, okay. Boy, oh, boy. I will say that compared to previous reactions to my cooking, this is a wild improvement. - It's not terrible. - Oh, my god. - That's huge, that's huge. That's incredible, wow. It's not terrible? - [Nick] No. - Zach, I would give
this three stars on Yelp. - Oh, my god. - I mean, I'm probably just
not eating good bagels. - [Nick] To get seeds to stick,
the easiest way to do that is to toss them in whatever
seed mixture you have right when they're hot. - That's exactly what you did. - A flawless technique. - Creativity, like, authenticity maybe? You kind of nailed the
traditional everything spice. - (whispering) Nailed? - I think maybe I'm
being a little too nice. - Nailed it? I knocked it out of the park! I had my sister ship
over some New York water to help with the bagel. Do you think I made New
York proud with this? - No. They're doing just fine. (everyone laughing) - I think we have a great rebuttal for when people say it's the water. (everyone laughing) - I guess, most importantly, is it a bagel? - It's a bagel! - It's a bagel. - Unfortunately, it's a bagel. - Catch me, I'm falling. - Yes, this is a bagel. - You did it! - That was his first-ever he made it. That was the first time. - You made it! - You made a bagel! - Judges, thank you so much. - Zach, this really is, I
think, your competition to lose. - Wow. - My father loves cinnamon and raisins. Every morning he eats
Raisin Bran for breakfast. And I wanted to honor my
father, Donald Habersberger, by creating the best bagel, cinnamon raisin bagels. Or as I like to call them, Daddy's Favorite. (everyone laughing) - [Eugene] Oh, god, no, Keith. - [Zach] Shout out to Don Habersberger! - [Jessica] They look like muffins. That looks like a muffin. - They are so heavy. This is so heavy. - Look at Jamie, what's going on? - Um, well, I was expecting to
be able to pick them easily. (everyone laughing) - This probably weighs
four to five pounds. (everyone laughing) - I can't really, like, tear. - Well, you got there. - [Jessica] They don't
look like bagels to me. - [Keith] They look
exactly like Panera bagels. - What do you think it looks like? - Like a muffin. - Are you crazy? Have you seen a muffin
in the last century? They don't look a thing like that! - There's just things coming out of it. - What are you talking about, raisins. Oh, it cuts like butter. - So it's very underbaked inside. - [Zach] Can you show us? - [Nick] Yeah, right here is usually, when you can kinda like-- - [Keith] Well, it's between the raisins. - I don't wanna eat this. - Give it a try. - Am I gonna get salmonella? - You'll never get salmon-ella, because it's sal-monella. - Oh. (everybody laughing) - Keith, Keith. - Gotcha. - Here you go. - Tough today. - I'm fighting back today. I'm not taking it lying down. - Um, definitely underbaked. - Uh huh. - [Nick] It's hard to tell whether there's still raw flour in this or you just put an insane
amount of cinnamon in it. - My father always said, ""Approach
life with a lot of grit."" - Good balance of flavor, though. It's not too sweet. - It tastes like raisins and bread, which is essentially a
cinnamon raisin bagel. So good job. But I don't really like it. (everybody laughs) - [Keith] Um, judges, do
you think it's a bagel? - In my mind, cinnamon raisin bagels aren't actually bagels. - You don't think the type of bagel I made even could be a bagel. - Exactly. If I had to, and I think I have to, it's a bagel. - It's so undercooked to the point that I can barely call it a bagel. - But can you barely call it a bagel? - I can barely call it a bagel. - That's plus one to the positive. - I don't think it's a bagel. I think we think it's a bagel, cause there's a hole in the middle. - I would agree with the other analysts. I think that you should pursue other means of honoring your father. - But do you not think it's a bagel? - I don't think it's a bagel. I think it's a bad cake with a hole in it. - So agree to disagree, but my dad's not gonna like that. - Judges, I wanted to
create an original bagel based off of my personality, so this has an infusion of
Korean flavors and beer. I call it the K-Ragel, yes. - [Nick] Ooh, I like the way this looks. - [Eugene] Yeah? - I mean, they are ugly, for sure. - They're very monstrous. - Jamie, what's going on? - My eyes are watering up. - Uh huh. There's a lot of gochugaru on it. - I'm gonna try and eat this. - I think we need a-- - [Eugene] Taste test first. - Well, he said beer. - I did put beer instead of water, and I also boiled it in a pot of beer. Have someone taste it before you taste it. - Okay. - [Nick] Ooh, kind of reddish. - Oh, I put gochugaru in the dough. - Yeah, it's fully baked. - Can I eat it? - We don't know yet. We gotta see. - You're not gonna be able to taste beer, because you can only taste the red-- - Gochugaru. - Yeah.
- Yeah. - Yeah. - So can? - Your mom's not, we gotta ask your mom. - Can I eat it? Okay. This is great. Oh, you were a chemist, so you would know. Can I eat it? - I don't know, we'd
have to run some tests. (everybody laughing) - [Jessica] Right, it
just goes in your, like. - I like to be challenged by food. A little too spicy, Jamie? - It was so spicy that I
couldn't taste anything. It like numbed my taste buds
in the worst possible way. - I like spicy food. I didn't think it was that spicy. - What about a spicy bagel, though? - I like it. - When you're expecting a bagel, and you eat it, and it tastes
like a Flaming Hot Cheeto. - It really-- - It does some stuff to your brain. - Oh, I'm rocking his world. - I think it's like food
trends a lot, you know. And this is a fusion that people will be super excited about. - There's a lot going on, but it is surprisingly bland. (sighs in disappointment) You've got everything on your side, except there's not a lot
of salt in there, dude. - The biggest thing for me is the grease. I can't, it's all over, uh. It's all over us. - I like this a lot. We finally have something creative. It almost tastes like a
Korean focaccia bread. - If you just eat the
crust, it is so good. - Yeah. - If you get any part of the inside, it is so bad. - It's not even that,
it's just like nothing. - Nothing, but in contrast
to like all that flavor that's in this bite, it kind of works. - I see what you mean. The top of my mouth is very happy. - Yeah, exactly. - [Eugene] But the bottom
just felt like it was filler. Is it a bagel? - [Jessica] I think it's a bagel. - I'm gonna go ahead and
say that that is a bagel. - This is exactly a bagel. - [Jamie] No. (everybody laughing) - Jamie, Jamie. Come on, rank it, Jamie. - I'm sorry. - Oh, man, I made the worst one for Jamie. Jamie hates it. - You hurt him. - I know. - Judges, I present to you my half-dozen sesame bagels. I love baking with my son, Wes, so I'm calling these my Wesame Bagels. (everybody awws) - [Keith] That is cute. - That's cute. - Daddy's favorite. (everybody laughs) - This one looks really perfect. - Yeah. - Yeah, these are the best
holes we've seen all day. - That's true. - Thank you. I poked it with a spoon,
kind of spun it around. Should taste a little
bit like country love. That's kind of my favorite
type of bread to make. - We're talking in baker's
percentages right now. This dude bakes right here. - Yeah, I've never made bagels before, but I do like baking bread, so. - [Jessica] Oh! - Okay, bubbles. - Bubbles? - [Jessica] It smells sweet. - [Nick] It does smell sweet. This is a problem. - Uh huh, that's the bottom. - [Nick] No, no, that's the top. - Oh, wow. - [Nick] All the sesame seeds fell off. - Oh, man, I guess the sesame
oil was not a good idea. - [Nick] That's very disrespectful. - So these are now plain bagels. - Yeah. - (all groaning) Oh, no. - [Jessica] Is that raw? - [Nick] It's definitely doughy. - (all groaning) Oh, no. - Oh, man. - (all groaning) Oh, no! - I brushed the sesame oil on before I put the sesame seeds on. - It is creative. - Thank you. - You think it's creative
that he added sesame oil? - Well and that it's kind of
like you start with a sesame, you end with a plain. (everybody laughs) - [Keith] It's like a transformer. - It has a mild tinge
of like sourness to it. It's well salted. I'd eat it. - Wow. - I'll go the total other way. I think this tastes like a breadstick that someone made on
their last day of work. - Okay. Thank you, thank you, chef. - I like it. I'm eating it. A lot of it. - [Jamie] Is it a bagel? - I think this is a B. S. O. I think it's a bagel-shaped object. - Yeah, I don't think this is a bagel. - Bro, bro, you looking at this? You're telling me this is not a bagel? - It's a sesame breadstick. - [Jessica] Do we think
it's creative though? - I think intention plays a role in the creative process
and so for that reason, I would say that this
is in no way creative. (everybody laughing) - In no way, shape, form. It's just not creative. Sorry. - Thank you, chefs. It's been a pleasure. We will let you deliberate and then return for your final judgment. (dramatic music) - [Nick] Walking in today,
you have these four guys making bagels without a recipe, which in and of itself
is just such a challenge. Most of these are bagels. - I really liked Keith's taste the best, and I could like eat it
all and not feel sick. - [Nick] It's shockingly good. Eugene's is obviously
quite a bit more creative. - [Jessica] This is my favorite for taste. - [Nick] But there was
something classic about Ned's. - Yeah, I didn't really
like either of those. For Eugene's, it just hurt me. It like physically hurt me. Zach's, um, salty food is good. - [Jessica] Definitely
better than I expected. - It's almost like when you
get like a salted pretzel. - I mean, I like that better than sweet. I don't, I'm not a sweet person. I didn't mind this. - I would put it at like number one. And then there's three number fours. - We've made out decision. Let's bring back the guys. (dramatic music) - We've made our decision. It wasn't unanimous. - [Eugene] Wow. - We haven't even started, Jamie just whispered, ""I'm sorry,"" to me. - Jamie, no. (everybody laughing) - He looked at me. - Overall, we were very impressed with the work that you guys put in. - We've been outside, and
we are all insanely nervous. - Three of you should be. - Okay. - Oh wow.
- Okay. - So in fourth place, of course (dramatic music) is Zach's bagel. - What?
- What? - Are you (bleeped out) kidding me? Are you out of your goddamn mind? Cover those ears. What? You all, 1, 2, 3, 4, said that was a bagel. That was the only one that you all said was a bagel. I flew water over the country for you. - Sorry you had to do that. - I think that there was a toxic energy surrounding my judging, and I was not given a fair shot. I started first. Y'all came in salty. Admittedly, so did my bagel. I am, I am (inhales). I am crushed. - I can't believe this. - Yeah, this was the
challenge you wanted to win. - I can't believe this. - Please, please explain. - It's salty. - Yeah, dude, it was
really really salty, dude. - We don't have anything else. It was really salty. (all laughing) - [Nick] Inedibly salty. - Inedible. - Um, to all the Jews out there, I am sorry. - Do we accept? - We accept. - This one hurts. This one stings. - Like when you put some
salt on a wound, right? (Ned laughing) In third place was (dramatic music) Keith. - That doughy bullshit? (everybody laughing) So it's between you two. - [Eugene] Okay, well, good luck, man. - Yeah, you too. - Okay, so I get to announce the winner. Eugene! - Are you serious? - I mean, come on, we loved yours. I mean-- - Are you serious, even Jamie? Everyone but Jamie? Wow, that's so unexpected. - It's pepper spray on a bagel! - Thank-- (everybody laughing) - Eugene's was just so
unique and flavorful that we really couldn't pass it up. - We would sell this at Belle's Bagels. I think we would even do
reasonably well with it. - Well, congratulations to Eugene and Ned. Sorry to Zach, and ""Hi, Dad"" from me. This has been Without a Recipe. We'll see you next week! What are we gonna try next? Bye! - Ice cream! - Oh, yeah. - It's ice cream. - Ice cream. - See you there, Jamie. - [Narrator] Next week
on Without a Recipe. - I have to win one of the episodes. (all singing loudly) - You knew that an 11-year-old was going to be judging this episode, and yet, you continue to put
heavy amounts of alcohol. (all singing loudly) - Guess what, y'all. My winning Korean bagels were so good that Belle's Bagels
decided to make their own. You can check out the Crazy Rich Bagel and Crazy Rich Sandwich
on the Try Guys IGTV. - Okay, since I disagreed with all of our other judges-- - Are you gonna close ranks? - I'm closing ranks. In fourth place, Eugene. In third place, Ned. - Okay. - First place, Keith. - Wow. - Wow, this is so great. - I'll take it, I'll take it.",33:05
rhwY04UAPmk,FoodTribe,Food,Can James May reintroduce the 'sugar sandwich' to 2020?,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhwY04UAPmk,,943K views,Food,careful not to inhale the powder you heard it here first folks be careful not to inhale the powder kids just say no hello brothers and sisters like comment subscribe and welcome back after a long absence to the bug out bunker kitchen for sandwiches of the 70s like comment subscribe this is an interesting one and you may not believe it if you're below a certain age but the filling is sugar now back when i were a lad as indeed tom on the camera the sugar sandwich was a thing i don't really know why but it was and we have since found evidence that it goes back a lot longer than we thought because we've discovered an evacuee from world war ii who was sent off to live in a farmhouse in the countryside from london because of the fear of him being annihilated by german bombs was given a sugar sandwich as a welcome treat when he arrived after which he was probably buried in the garden the process begins as ever with some hospital bread and we're going to make actually should we make an entire sugar sandwich crew oh sorry i forgot to say we also have in the baguette bunker lucy brown of food tribe and drive tribe and she has never even heard of a sugar sandwich and she's certainly never had one she was born in 2018 or something so we have the perfect guinea pig for trying it out we start with some lurpak spreadable butter invented in 1903 i think but it's a while back so i may have that wrong plenty of it flooding the cowling one side only for reasons of economy as tom pointed out earlier when we used to make these as children we were usually unsupervised that's how we got away with it and we were discussing how much sugar did we actually put in and it was almost certainly too much because at the age of eight you would put too much sugar in something i reckon we'll see a heaped teaspoon will probably do it what do we think some of that has missed the sandwich entirely are you ready for this lucy brown not really yes you are would you like that lucy cut in half diagonally or rectangularly rectangularly correct you want it diagonally don't you but you know that that will be denied i'm going to give this i made a terrible job with that i mean it makes it i can remember that very evocative the slight crunching as the knife goes through it because of the granules of sugar that i was briefly eight years old then lucy brown if you'd like to step forward and try sugar sandwich tom i think you should also try the sugar sandwich but actually i should i cut this half in half again and then we can all enjoy the sugar sandwich can i have a half no those are for me and tom and you have to eat it all remember if this was 1940 this would be the best thing you'd ever had and it would be the best thing you could hope for for the next four years don't like it okay the butter and the sugar don't go together well they go together in a cake you can't leave it children are starving there are bombs falling you can't leave it tom yes excuse fingers not quite enough sugar hmm how's that the texture of a sandy beach picnic yeah yeah it does it tastes like sandwiches or it feels like sandwiches taste on beach holidays back in the day because they always had sand in everything had sand in sandwiches drinks your pants dad's car i would say a little more sugar but back in the 70s you had white sugar i think a couple of posh people might have had brown sugar to put in coffee but white sugar was used for sorry for speaking with an ethyl pretty much everything but what if we repeat that process and we use dark brown soft natural unrefined cane sugar this is the stuff it's not like demerara sugar this is the stuff that's slightly sticky this has been in the bug-out bunker for some time um but it's sugar so i mean it can't go off can it really unless you get sugar weevil in it and i don't even know if sugar weevil is a thing is sugar weevil a thing you see you get weeblem flour don't you like comment subscribe put on lurpax spreadable butter invented i think in 1903 if it's not invented in 1903 you can tell me in the comments whilst you're in the comments you can also like and subscribe brown sugar ah then this is gonna be interesting this might have to be spread a bit now that really is like sand tom you could make a small castle out of that now that is interesting because it has a it has a slight taste of either cognac no armagnac i think i mean it has a richness and a slight woodiness i think this is going to be a much better sugar sandwich experience but we should bear in mind that nobody having been evacuated to norfolk or wherever in world war ii would have ever come near anything like this because brown sugar hadn't yet been invented lucy brown would you like this diagonal rectangular like comment subscribe rectangular and tommy are you interested in trying again oh yeah i quite enjoyed the first one i i liked it it sort of it reassured me as i've said before it's a bit like seeing a kid with mums lucy brown would you like to try the executive version of the sugar sandwich it looks better no it's got too much sugar in it takes all the moisture out of your mouth okay nobody would have said that in 1940 the idea of too much sugar would have blown people's minds it wasn't possible tom do you mind if i pass it over so this is unrefined brown sugar sugar in its possibly its most natural form it tastes too posh he's not trying hard enough no it's just like a very sweet sandwich right yeah the normal sugar sandwich tastes like a high point in a world of austerity which is undoubtedly what it was this tastes like this is a bit like somebody trying to make posh fish finger sandwiches it's overdone it's actually not very nice no that's exactly right it's not very nice i wouldn't bother with that we also have in my magic drawer icing sugar and sugar lumps how about a sugar lump sandwich because it occurs to me that in a normal sugar sandwich the sugar is a consistent flavor throughout the whole thing or it is if you've made it expertly as i have just done here but with sugar lumps the sugar will be occasional sometimes you will get a bite of bread and lurpak invented in 1903 like comment subscribe sometimes you will get the added bonus of sugar but you won't know when it's going to happen and that makes a sandwich exciting like comment subscribe lear pack one side only and we have to consider here it's very important the distribution of the sugar cubes or sugar lumps as i would still call them and the frequency thereof ah ah oh look it's like a cafe okay so let's say it's a bit like arranging your battleships um look away lucy brown so you don't know where the sugar lumps are so what we'll do what lucy's not listening is leave a whole corner of the sandwich with no sugar in it that's the disappointment corner that corner is rich lucy brown that was a bit of a giveaway here is your half of the sugar cube sandwich i'm sure this is going to be really hard to chew you may have to let it dissolve in your mouth a bit like all good food don't cheat by looking at it and working out where the sugar lamp is much worse is it right tom who i'm i'm right on him i was right on a sugar limb there fingers okay no i'm wrong oh it makes the butter suddenly become really rancid yes it does and it isn't rounded this is a new pot of lurpak's petable spreadable butter invented in 1903 like comment subscribe for the health conscious amongst you i thought we should try in fact i'm going to make this a smaller sandwich because i'm conscious that we're wasting bread and we've got some fantastic experiments to do with sandwiches later on what if we try low calorie sweetener as used by people who eat far too much of everything but think they will slim if they simply put that in a cup of coffee instead of half a spoonful of sugar let's find out i'm not very hopeful about this i've never ever used a sweetener in my life so it smells like polystyrene granules lucy brown are you ready to try the sweetener sandwich have you ever used sweetener in tea or coffee or have you had low calorie drinks yes i think it's they're made with something similar please come around enjoy i won't enjoy you don't know that have an open mind i bet you didn't like you still don't like cheese do you do you drink wine no how did you live in france if you don't drink wine and you don't eat cheese it was tough i bet it was i bet the french had a high opinion of you didn't they the hospital doesn't drink wine is it poor that was a bit cruel i should have done that myself first since this is an unknown tom it's only small what does that even taste of it's haunted this reminds me some kind of like a medicine being delivered via a lump of bread to make the medicine go down more easily it's kind of strange and otherworldly isn't it yes when we were lads i don't know if this all happens but was it the polio vaccine that was put in a sugar lump it wasn't it was injected into the middle of a sugar lamp and then you went to see the nurse at school and she gave you sugar lump and you chewed it and then you were free from the threat of polio i think that sort of brings us to the end of sugar sandwiches and if that actually makes it onto our website we all know we were really desperate but the conclusion what about that do you actually want to try icing sugar okay yes we must be rigorous in the interest of the scientific method you know how this bit goes like comment subscribe subscribe like comment comment subscribe like the pack not too much of it interferes with the rather delicate flavor of the sugar it's in a bag as well did you see that that was a remarkable effect it's like dry ice so what is this is i what is icing sugar is it is it a different type of sugar or is it just a different level of refinement no idea you know what this is have we got something like a tea strainer because we should really do this like you would do it on a cake lucy do you know if you've got a sieve we don't have a sieve okay so it's going to be i really think you only want the dusting of this because when you make a victoria sponge which i have now done in my forthcoming cooking show on amazon plug who also do streaming music next day delivery and more come on get off you put a tiny amount on the top of the cake and that is enough you will notice it so that is plenty of icing sugar flood the cowling lucy brown in the next episode we've got rachel hogg here eating pickles bet you can't wait careful not to inhale the powder you heard it here first folks be careful not to inhale the powder kids just say no what do you think not a huge fan have you ever liked anything yeah i liked your jam sandwich you liked what did you have the other day salmon carpaccio you liked that didn't you he's just too posh tom oh sorry should i cut that in half otherwise i'm neglecting my duty as one of the researchers in this would you like the crusty bit or the middle bed i'll take the middle bit that's a very elegant little sandwich that's almost like something you get as an embassy well i'm sorry to say normal sugar is best that one makes just the rancid thing with the butter again doesn't it yeah not good so that lad back in 1940 in his farmhouse where he was evacuated had the correct sugar sandwich made with sugar pretty much that sugar which is unchanged for centuries and that's how it should be progress is great i like things to move on but i'm afraid the sugar sandwich hasn't thank you for watching like comment subscribe goodbye you,15:41
j5gy6QLq8wg,Abroad in Japan,Blog,6 Must Try Japanese Foods | Iwate,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5gy6QLq8wg,5 years ago,2.4M views,Blog,"Americans are so polite. All of us! I do think Americans are more polite than
British people sometimes. Yeah. And friendlier. Definitely friendlier. A lot of British people aren’t very friendly
though are they? No we’re horrible. Absolutely horrible. Japan is home to arguably the finest cuisine
in the world. Prepared with the freshest ingredients At the hands of some of the the world’s most disciplined chefs. Now all we have to do now is get out there
and eat it all - which is a sacrifice, I’m willing to make. I recently won a competition called Tohoku 365 To travel around the entire northern region of Tohoku, through 6 different prefectures In search of the very best local food. In the last episode we explored Miyagi prefecture,
eating our way through 6 delicious must try local dishes. 6 prefectures. 6 dishes. There seems to be a worrying pattern emerging
around the number 6. This week we’re continuing our journey around
to Iwate prefecture, Japan’s second biggest prefecture Where I’ll be catching up with
Natsuki and trying one of my favourite Japanese dishes And meeting a local expat from America, who’ll be showing us around one of Iwate’s biggest street markets. But like all good trips, we start off with
a bucket of Genghis Khan… Like the Mongolian dictator? What. I won’t lie, I was pretty excited when I
heard of a local dish in Iwate, called Genghis Khan. I was even more excited to discover the dish
involves barbequed lamb A meat which is pretty rare to find in Japan. Despite the name Genghis Khan is a Japanese dish It got its name as Japanese people commonly associated Mongolia with sheep. And naturally it made sense to name the dish
after a historic dictator from the same country. My only criticism was the dish didn’t come
with a side of Chairman Mao. It’s the only time that I’ve had lamb
in Japan. Lamb is actually my favourite meat, but I’ve
done without it since living in Japan. It’s nice to finally get hold of some - and
cook it on a bucket. The best place in Iwate to enjoy Genghis Kan,
is the countryside town of Tono. It turns out people in Tono like to wander
off into the countryside for bbq’s And the bucket is their answer to a portable bbq. What I like about this is you put the lamb
on top and the fat on top And then the juices run down into the vegetables on the side to give them a meaty flavour. And you’ve got this sauce here which is
soy sauce mixed with ginger That goes really well with the lamb. Very good. The future is buckets. With a population of 300,000 Morioka might
not be a large city by Japanese standards, but it’s certainly bustling with character. And as luck would luck would have it, I’ve
managed to find myself a tour guide; a local American expatriate called Quinlan, who I’ve
met through Airbnb. It’s worked out pretty well as he’s kindly offered to show us around the Morioka’s bustling street market. Glorious American hospitality. I’d recommend getting some of these. You’re hungry right? I’ll get five of these. One of the most popular stands in the market
is a stall selling smoked goods. Mr Toyama sells a variety of food that’s
he professionally smoked himself Ranging from fish to vegetables and even cheese. And it's not long before I’ve snapped
up a plateful of smoked camembert. He’s got a lot of smoked internal organs
if you’re feeling adventurous. Smoked internal organs? Yeah. That sounds appealing… I think I’ll stick with the cheese. Yeah I’m with you. It’s funny I always talk about how there’s
no cheese in Japan and yet we’ve found cheese in Miyagi prefecture and now cheese in Iwate
prefecture as well. Clearly I’m wrong. I haven’t been looking hard enough for the
last 4 years. I could take you to see cows tomorrow? If you’re still entranced What an offer! There’s some
dairy farms around here. I could take you to see some cows tomorrow. That’d be a great chat up line! How would you like to see some cows? I can take you tomorrow. With that dashing accent, definitely. Americans are so polite. All of us! 100% of the time. I do think Americans are more polite than
British people sometimes. Yeah. And friendlier. Definitely friendlier. A lot of British people aren’t very friendly
though are they? No we’re horrible. Absolutely horrible. So what’s this Quinlan? That is a Tofu Dengaku. What does Dengaku mean? Lightening study. No, it means smeared with Miso and then fried
or grilled. I like the sound of lightening study. So Tofu with miso smeared on it, cooked over
charcoal. Like a Tofu lollipop. It’s very salty. Tofu is flavourless, so it’s nice to have
a bit of flavour on it. It’s coming off. Quite healthy? Yeah Tofu’s healthy. This is a Vegans dream - a tofu lollipop,
and it’s slowly going down the stick. Not the easiest thing to eat. Being a Vegan isn’t easy. Being a Vegan isn’t easy! Having officially lived a difficult life as
a vegan - for 90 seconds I’m going in search of Morioka’s most famous food. Morioka might not be huge, but it still has
quite the culinary identity The city is well known for it’s three famous noodle dishes; each of them surprisingly different. You might already know the first noodle dish,
Wankosoba. Wankosoba is less of a dish, more of a hardcore challenge Whereby you're given an unlimited amount of buckwheat soba noodles served in tiny bowls And have to basically shot them continuously until you either give up or are physically sick. It's said that a real man should be able to
eat 100 bowls Which I was able to do when I challenged my friend Ryotaro on a trip last year. For more details on Wankosoba, and to see
who won the challenge, be sure to check out our video. The second type of noodle was named after
your favourite Star Wars character. That's right, Jajamen, and no I'm not making
that name up. Jajamen is a dish comprised of thick noodles,
similar to udon, covered with a meaty miso sauce and cucumber. My first impression upon trying it was 
""It's the closest thing I've had in Japan to spaghetti bolognese"". But as well as being named after your favourite
Star Wars character, it's also a 2 in 1 dish. Once you finished 2/3 of the bowl, hand it
over to shop staff who will add the hot water used to cook the noodles, and convert the
dish into a soup called Chi Tantan. It's honestly one of the most unique and delicious
dishes I've had in Japan so far. The last of the 3 famous noodles is Reimen,
a cold noodle dish originally from Korea. The noodles are rubbery in texture and somewhat
translucent, with the cold soup served typically with beef, kimchi, cucumber, and a piece of
fresh fruit. In my case, watermelon. Yay, watermelon. The soup is a little bit spicy, hence the
fresh fruit to soothe your mouth. But for me, the best of the 3 great noodle
dishes of Morioka has to be Jajamen Not just because it brought back nostalgic memories
of my favourite Star Wars character But because it's like nothing I've had in Japan before
with the thick meaty miso sauce Being the perfect combination with the thick noodles. There's no better way to end your day with
a bowl of Jajamen, and a bucket of Genghis Khan. Food with names. I've been looking forward to this all week:
visiting restaurant Wakana, one of Morioka's top Teppanyaki restaurants. There are 2 ways of preparing beef in Japan. First is through a hotpot called Sukiyaki. The second is Teppanyaki, which literally
translates as iron plate grill. And in my opinion, Teppanyaki is the best
way to enjoy wagyu beef. Oh, it's really cool we got our own little
dining area. Our own little walled off dining area. Like a garden or something, with a big brick
wall. The highlight of Teppanyaki is the sense of
theatre. We'd have our own personal chef cooking us
a succulent cut of Maesawa beef Iwate's most famous beef, and amongst the top 5 cuts of
beef in all Japan. Maesawa beef, you know? Maesawa beef, it's art, and the world. I say theatre, it can also feel a bit like
torture. Watching the juicy cut of steak being prepared
in front of you for 20 minutes. Finally, the steak is sliced into bite sized chunks And served with a spicy chili miso sauce. Eating the steak is a sensation difficult to put into words But fortunately we’ve got Natsuki on hand to deliver his premium verdict. Before I try it, I want to see how Natsuki
reacts. 1 to 10? Maybe 10. 10? 10! In one word - one English word - how would
you describe it? Justice delicious! That’s two words Justice delicious! That doesn’t make sense! Justice delicious Oh number one! Tohoku number 1. Justice delicious. You heard it here first, Maesawa beef. Not justice! Trust me! Trust you. You could be a great food reviewer. Trust us. I feel like I’m eating something that’s
been sent from God. Like a river. Like a slowly river. Like a quiet lake. Like a quiet lake or a slow river. It’s art. It is art. It looks like art, it tastes like art. It’s so good, eating it feels like you’re
doing something terrible. I feel like I should just sit here and admire
it. 1 to 10 you know. It’s over 10 for the first time. That’s impossible! I can believe. In our next journey with Tohoku 365, we’ll
be visiting the prefecture of Aomori. Where Natsuki gets up close with Jaws. Nice dental. Nice dental? I create the ultimate bowl of sashimi at an
innovative all you can eat fish market And an entire city is brought to a standstill,
by a tortoise randomly walking down a street. It's the sort of exciting, surprising, bizarre
things you sometimes see everyday whilst walking around Japan. Many thanks for watching guys, we'll see you
next time. Maesawa beef, you know? Maesawa beef, it's art. And the world.",12:32

views,"Automobile,Comedy",here at drivetribe we wanted to grab the three founders for a quick update on how their 2021 was going and what plans they have for the rest of the year we've already posted an update from richard hammond if you haven't watched that yet the link to it is in the description below so next up is jeremy here is what he had to say jeremy thank you for having us and thank you for your time nice of you to be here you run out i thought we'd ask how your 2021 is going what you've been up to so far well i've um i've been south america um traveled extensively down through italy um oh wait no i haven't been anywhere that's what i meant to say no like absolutely everybody um i've been here on the farm um ever since it began and it's great it's great there's no pressure to think we should be going on holiday or we should be having friends over whatever you can just you know grow faster and do nothing i was going to say what has the decision been with the beard are you going to keep it it's a project no god no this is coming off on sunday um no it's a project it was something to do you know everybody some people learn how to make sourdough bread some people have been learning french i thought i'll grow a beard see what it's like to be a socialist i don't like it it's coming off so a bunch of last year was you filming your farm show is that all completely wrapped and how was that production that's the app fan show's done that's um i'm looking forward to people's reactions to that because it's it's like nothing i've done before it's it's um genteel it's quiet nobody falls over nobody catches fire nobody explodes um it's a quite genteel look at how farming is done and how i react to it it's it's a nice program i think i think people will go that's a that's a nice program and there's some amazing facts about farming in it which is cool i'm looking forward to it and obviously it's been in the news quite a lot recently the grand tour went to scotland and from what we've seen big bulky american saloon cars yeah is there anything you can tell us about that how did that production go i've just um i've seen the first cut of that um it's uh it's it's like unplugged is what i'd say it's lots and having to make unplugged so because we're not abroad because we're not dealing with extreme heat or extreme cold or extreme terrain really um it's like us three are doing what we did do years and years and years ago where we're sort of in england not england it's scotland but in britain and it's um it's a bit cold and it rains a lot and it's um it's kind of also there is an interesting point which is why didn't we ever buy american cars um so i i yeah it's there's some yeah hammond has an accident of course that's what you want to hear so hammond has an accident um may tries to be interesting which is hilarious um it's it's it's a fun program it's good it's it's i think a lot of people will like scotland and what have you got planned for the rest of the year more milly there or i'm doing who wants to be a millionaire next week i've got another show on itv which i'm recording in early april then and late april we go off and we do the next grand tour which again is going to be in the uk nothing we can do about that um and then we and then we'll have to start work on the grand tour after that when we will be allowed to go abroad but we don't know where abroad because uber does um so it's a very busy year it's been it's been busy so far and we we've got all the the seeds in this year was we didn't manage last year because of the weather but um so the farm is um it's keeping me busy and the shop keeps me busy um we might be doing another farming series who knows what's up up to amazon um yeah so there's a lot on a lot well i thought i'd finish with a bit of a random question i've asked richard this and we're going to ask james this later if you had a completely blank check and no executives to tick any boxes with and you could film any piece of content series or documentary about anything what would it be you might have already made it well i was about to say if you could choose any program to make i'd get a couple of mates and then travel around the world driving other people's cars into things okay falling over and having a laugh because i genuinely can't think of a program that you'd want to make more than why would anybody make a program that wasn't that if they could i mean you can get you can literally choose any country in the world let's go to chile let's go to vietnam let's go anywhere we want any way we want and buy any car we want and do anything we want with it you know okay so you know james is there but then that's amusing in itself you know i think it's rather interesting now is when he says something's about to be interesting you know it isn't going to be interesting but that in itself is is worth having along no i would definitely go around the world and um do what i have been doing for the last 30 years sounds good jeremy thanks for your time many thanks for coming thank you lucy thank you [Music] all in a big field and some huts all sort of furry and happy and i just go and talk to them [Music] you,6:01
sWy1qmMoToM,Captain Disillusion,Informative,The Undebunkable,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWy1qmMoToM,5 years ago,4.1M views,Informative,"Greetings children, it's me, Captain Disillusion. Thank you for all your excellent video suggestions. It's great how you and I are on the same wavelength. We get it, unlike the rest of society. Am I right? (sighs) People with their opinions and natural reactions to things. They think music is cool and jokes are funny and recipe videos are pleasant to watch. It's like everyone's in a cult. Remember the alligator golf course video from last month? Everyone was so amazed by the prehistoric creature strutting on the green, but no one had the brains to figure out right away that it's fake. Obviously it can't be real because 'alligator too big.' If you look at the pixels you begin to see that it looks all weird and stuff. The walking seems - like, totally animated in like a classic computer CGI graphics way and why is the guy not scared? I would be scared. I mean it did happen in Florida which is basically a pile of alligators shaped like a peninsula, and the people that golf there did say this gator is almost like a mascot of the place that everybody knows, but still. I just don't think it looks right and also this other angle taken from another phone is totally fake too. It's actually kind of obvious when you know what to look for. Let me illustrate with another one of your requests. Ah, here's a goodie - the Flyboard Air. A company that makes water jetpacks suddenly came out with a personal flying machine? Ha, as if. Are we supposed to believe that Technologies now exist that make an invention like this possible even though just a few years ago they did not? I don't think so. Just ask yourself, ""have I ever seen jet turbines lift something that proportionally heavy? And where's the fuel supposed to be? The backpack? Oh. Well, what kind of fuel is it? Well, how come the video has fake-looking edits during the landing? And I don't hear about how there are a bunch of other videos of uninterrupted takes showing an entire flight or an official Guinness World Records breaking flight in front of a huge crowd. When even a ufologist claims that the whole thing is an elaborate hoax, you know it's gotta be fake. Debunked. What else you got? Talk to me Facebook. Hm, let's see. ""When you get a chance, you know, not right away, may you debunk this?"" I sure may Zack. (a woman screams) Whatever this is, it's totally fake because just look at it. Graphics don't float on water. They go on paper or skin. I certainly wouldn't be able to figure out how to do this and Occam's razor dictates that therefore no one could. So even if we type the word thats under the video into the internet and find a detailed article about this printing technique. We can be sure that it's wrong Wikipedia? Please. It's run by a cabal of critical-thinking extremists obsessed with perpetual refinement of factual information through rigorous citation of credible sources. You can't trust that (explicative). (device starts malfunctioning) But I don't have to tell you that. You're a proper skeptic you know you can't trust anything you see on the internet or hear on the news anymore period. End of thought process. [Captain D]: No! What's more likely? That flimsy explanations about exposure ratios, movement in a vacuum, or how Hollywood movie props aren't labeled with letters prove that we actually went to the freaking moon like some sci-fi fairy tale? Or that maybe it was filmed on a soundstage as part of a global conspiracy by the old powerful and extremely well-funded government Organization, NASA. [Captain D]: (banging on the glass) No! Stop! Come on. Humans getting into spaceships and risking their lives to prove that the Earth, our home is just another rock and an endless void of rocks and dust. I'm not ready to accept that yet. I'm not ready to accept that Paul McCartney isn't a look-alike who was secretly enlisted into the Beatles after the real Paul died in a car crash in 1966. Look it up. The evidence is everywhere. And I'm not ready to accept that a group of deeply misguided individuals could put about as much effort as it takes to create one of my videos into destroying two of the tallest buildings in the most iconic city in the western hemisphere and killing three thousand people. Those people must have been actors. They didn't die. The whole thing is a carefully orchestrated hoax by powerful people more capable than any of us They do it all the time. When a natural disaster a bombing or a shooting causes innocent people to die, it's probably not real. And someone, even if they didn't have our best interest in mind, was in control. Because if no one was in control that would be terrifying. (an explosion) [Captain D]: Enough! It is terrifying, but the terror wears off, and if you're willing to endure feeling disillusioned for a while, you get to see the world through new eyes. A world where rationality and critical thinking lead to empathy and social growth. [Imposter D]: Don't tell me about social growth. [Captain D]: Who are you? [Imposter D]: I'm Zeitgeist, the spirit of the age. And they're with me. [Captain D]: If you're so popular, what's with the chameleon routine? [Imposter D]: The Zeitgeist tends to change. [Captain D]: Well, I tend to kick the ass of anyone who kidnaps me and messes with the minds of my viewers. So let's settle this. [Imposter D]: Not tonight, honey. I have a headache. [Captain D]: Listen to me: the power to tell real from fake doesn't come from being a world expert or Mistrusting every single thing you see. It comes from an honest willingness to change your opinions and beliefs based on new facts. So learn to enjoy being wrong. The world might start making more sense. You won't feel quite as out of step with the rest of humanity, your words won't cause needless pain to people who suffered real tragedies, and the words of others won't sway you into believing myths over truth. You'll be able to love with your heart, but use your head for everything else.",7:07
06w3-l1AzFk,ElectroBOOM,Science,How Safe Is the SHOWER HEAD OF DOOM?!,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06w3-l1AzFk,2 years ago,4.7M views,Science,"Hi!, in my previous video about
getting electrocuted in a bathtub, I briefly mentioned suicide showers. Which is what people call them
because you have to bring live wires with you in the
bathroom to heat the water. But then, there were tons of comments,
mostly from my beloved Brazilian viewers that were shocked by my comments. *chuckles* shocked! Saying that millions of people's there
use this showerhead with no problems. There was this outpour of people in the
streets demanding my exile. Just kidding. But seriously, it seems like a majority of
people there, as well as some other countries like Mexico use these shower
heads and people seem to be okay. I didn't want to make this video because
bigclive and DiodeGoneWIld have already made good videos
on the topic, and me being a bigger channel, my video would probably pop first pushing their videos down getting more views. Ok, let's do it, but I'll pick a different title so that our videos won't
show in the same search. So I bought one of these from
Amazon to try and see if I survive. Since you can buy these in Canada, you
would assume that it's tested and safe. I'm starting to doubt our system... Let's see what's inside the suicide
shower and if it is truly suicidal. Okay, so here we have two bare heating
elements for two heat settings that are completely exposed to the
running water without isolation. There is a diaphragm back here that when
there is pressure from running water, it switches the contacts on
to make sure the elements are only powered when there
is running water. Otherwise, the whole thing would melt and burn in fire. The damn thing draws 50 amps max. The ground wire goes in the middle of the diaphragm
to ground the water at the output and also goes straight into the input water to ground the input as well. Now the question is, would this be
enough to ensure the water pouring on your head is not
equivalent to live wire and electrocute your brain cells.
The structure of this shower is kind of smart, I don't know if it's the same
case for all of them, but, the entire water passing over
the live wires must go through this hole first before getting out where the
ground wire is sitting at the middle. So it might be possible for the ground wire to remove all the charges from the water before getting out. Now, I'm not saying it's impossible to have a safe water heater with you in the shower. It's actually simple to make. See if the heating element is isolated from live wires like these oven elements, then there is no problem. If I
turn it on and touch the element, there is no electricity on the surface, just heat. These run on 240 volt AC and are safe to touch. Can't remove it. If I turn it on, I read 204 volts? Oh, right because at my home the voltage,
is made from the difference between 220 volt AC phases 120 degrees apart. Now if I change the volume, the voltage should change. Oh, maybe it's doing some special
way for modulation like PWM or a light dimmer and my
meter is not detecting it well. So I brought my scope here to check
the actual waveform using my differential probe because I don't want to
accidentally short the program to 200 volt AC Oh wait. I just remembered something. CircuitSpecialists sent me a new tool
that could be pretty helpful here. There. Then sent me a handheld oscilloscope. This is a 70MHz-2-channel oscilloscope
with its own 25MHz function generator and a complete digital multimeter. I mean if it works  well, it will make life much easier for some measurements. It runs on battery or isolated USB power
so it would be completely isolated from live wires and it's much more portable. I'll
continue using it throughout the video to check its performance. I mean
for around 200V AC, I mean $200, it's pretty affordable and I'll giveaway 10 of them at the end of
the video. Checking the voltage first... Yep, the screen is pretty
adequate for a multimeter. But voltage still doesn't change by the
volume. It comes with one probe... But  fortunately, I have more.
Okay, let's check the voltage. There you go! Well, the display is a bit small for a scope, but I mean it's a handheld scope and it is still pretty clear. But the voltage... Still doesn't change by the volume. Well, maybe I have to load it with the elements
so the proper waveform shows up. I tied some wires to the element
terminal so I can probe them. Now if I turn on the voltage-
[Plug pops] SH***T Let me use some electric tape. Damnit! Now the oven doesn't turn off! Have to figure out what's going on. Maybe it's a stuck relay. There is not much going on here. Maybe these switches stuck or something. Okay, so this contact was welded to the one below, but they are disconnected now. You know, probing stuff, you have to be more careful. Well, I did find some leads in... garbage thrown back here. Hey! Back in business. Hopefully nothing gets shorted again. Just note that there is no ground between these two wires. Each one is one phase. Both dangerous! There we go. The hell?! The voltage still doesn't change!
How does it adjust the temperat- Oo, turned off? Oh s*** Such an idiot! Yep. I'm an idiot! You work with fancy PWM control systems
to drive loads and motors so much you forget stupid stuff like
this oven work in simple ways! This thing is just one minute on, one minute
off, one minute on, one minute off and the on/off duration is
controlled by this... knob Was it calling it a volume all this time?
I'm not recording all that s*** again. The point is, this showerhead could also be made of such an isolated heating element with proper electronics to more precisely control the heat Let's go install it. I don't have a power outlet right here, unlike what it shows in the
installation sheet, which is good. I mean, you don't want to live
wire with you in the bathtub, but I guess it's okay in some countries.
Survival of the fittest. But this length of wire is
not enough anyway. Okay, so I wired everything up and
plugged in my power into the GFCI outlet to prevent me
from death. Let's turn it on [Water sprinkling] Well, I was expecting the GFCI to pop So I connected my amp meter in series with the
ground wire to see how much current is going through the ground and it's a little bit less than point 8 milliamps - which is not a lot. It is still good enough to give
you a little bit of shock but it's much less than the
5 milliamp limit that the GFCI trips at. This amount of current depends
on the quality of water and the voltage. So if you're in a country with 240 volt AC and more impure water, this current might be too much
that will trip (the) GFCI. For example, the tap hot water is more
conductive and if I make it more, you see that the ground wire current is
rising. I've heard in some countries, they disconnect the ground wire to make this work
and that makes *this* much more dangerous. Sh**, the room breaker popped. How much current is it drawing? I set it to minimum and the breaker still
popped. Let's measure the current. Another tool from circuit specialists. It's 19 amps! So if you want to fully use this, not only
you have to make sure you have at least a 50 amp breaker, you have
to make sure the house wiring is rated for 50 amps. Otherwise, you'll
set the whole thing on fire. Now I'm going to measure the
AC voltage between the water, which I'll probe with a spoon,
to the faucet which is my ground. And if I probe from far, you see that there is no AC voltage because the water droplets are disconnected. But if I get close, I read as high as 7V AC. [SNIFFING] I can smell wires burning now. So the voltage is not high enough to give you a shock over your skin. But if it goes into your eyes or mouth, it
could really hurt. Okay, let's try it I put one foot on the drain as ground and
bring my tongue as close as possible. Yeah, I feel nothing! Okay, so although there is voltage, there
might be a very high resistance series with it so that when you get in the way,
that voltage drops to zero. Okay, let's measure the AC voltage again but this time, I'll put my body
parallel to it to see what happens to the voltage. See? From
around 5 volts when I touch it, It drops to like, 0.7 volts So this confirms that, in my
setup, this water cannot supply high voltage or current to
shock you. So, I hate to say it, But beside these loose
wires and the fact that it may set your house on fire, It
seems pretty safe. But I mean, this is left to
people to install and you know people they may not
connect the ground properly. Let's see what happens in that case. Now, it is connected the ground
wire and if I probe the water, I get Close to 45 volts! Now if I touch the spoon,
the voltage drops to around 2 volts. Still hurt if it gets into your mouth. Still nothing. Which is good I guess... So if this is installed absolutely correctly
by a professional and it never fails considering its questionable quality, Then you might be safe. Knowing that there is a little bit of current constantly running through you when you are taking a shower. That tiny current draw would be
double or more in countries with 240 volt AC which might still
be safe on the other hand, the current draw from the
power lines would be half. So it's safer that way. Maybe
it won't give you a shock, maybe you won't accidentally
touch the hanging loose wires, or set your home on fire
or get cancer over time. All I know is that, this
thing actually proved itself to be quite useful and I'll give
away 10 of these. ♪ GIVEAWAY TIME!!! ♪ Well, I already said it. Thanks to

0SnTzvCH6lc,LevelCapGaming,VideoGames,Insurgency - A True Tactical Shooter,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SnTzvCH6lc,7 years ago,1.3M views,VideoGames,hey guys level-cap here today I want to talk to you about a game that I have been really surprised by somebody recommended to check out insurgency on Steam it's for the PC and Mac currently I think it's about 15 dollars and I wasn't really expecting a lot from it I checked out a few screenshots wasn't too impressed with the graphics it's running on the source engine which is definitely capable but you know small teams have limited production time and resources so like just spending tons of time on graphics really isn't economical especially for a small indie game like this but you'll notice that the screen itself is very limited for the heads-up display you'll notice a few little markers on the screen showing control points in the bottom right it'll show me what fire mode my gonna set to and how many magazines I have you don't save bullets when you reload the damage model is insane one-shot headshot with any gun you're down from any range pretty much and as far as body shots go it's one to two body shots that seems like to take people out they're going for a realistic damage model here so when you're playing for the counter insurgents essentially the US team and you have an m16 a 4 on burst fire mode that 3 shot burst fire is capable of taking down 2 people essentially so rather than having to try and recreate real guns that take you know multiple shots to take down one person with a 30-round magazine and trying to balance that out the guns perform in a way that is very very realistic to the way that they would in real life the damage model means that one magazine can seriously deal with a lot of enemy threats you don't have to worry about reloading until you're really up against the wall and you've been in a sustained firefight for some time you'll see here that when i zoom in with this optic the surrounding area around the scope is not magnified only the scope itself is magnified which makes a lot of sense and I've been wanting for more games to take this approach there are other shooters out there that do this but I've never seen it done quite like they have in insurgency and it looks really cool and very realistic too you'll notice that when i zoom in I can even bring the scope larger on screen there that's actually focusing so when you hold shift like sniping in battlefield 4 the scope will get steadier and you will look in a little bit closer you can do this with any optic on any gun and it's very useful for trying to be precise and hit long-range targets and it really does create that sort of realistic situation where you might be scanning around looking down sights and then you see a target with a gun in real life and you sort of take a breath maybe focus a little bit more things become clearer that you're looking at and then you take the shot and they've replicated that really well in insurgency the game supports third-party map design and this map that I'm playing here isn't one of the better-looking Maps you'll see later in this gameplay that there's actually going to be some really good-looking levels it is the source engine and if you guys remember you know titanfall is being made on the source engine so the engine is very capable of making some great looking games and here's one of the the maps that actually does look really good and makes the game look a bit more impressive I'm just liking the starkness of it though this is definitely a hardcore shooter it's not a slow-paced as I've experienced with some of the other hardcore shooters out there like ARMA or America's army back in the day you had some shooters that were very very slow placed where somebody would just go prone and just sit in a corner all game long that does happen a little bit in insurgency but there's time limits and there's capture points which really force people to get out of their comfortable hiding zones and engage the enemies one of the boldest things that insurgency has done is to get rid of any sort of kill feed so when I kill players in here I don't have any way of knowing if I got the kill although I did notice you can bring up a menu and it'll tell you how many kills you have in that round and that is a way of doing it but since a lot of walls are not bulletproof in this and you end up shooting through them to try and hit your target not only are you not going to get hitmarker so you have no idea if you got a hit on the guy but you won't know if you killed them either so you basically fire through a wall if you don't hear moving you sort of move around quietly investigate and confirm the kill on your own it's very realistic in that way and it's really awesome it totally takes you out of the element that you're playing a game all of a sudden you feel like you are soldier moving around in this really hostile you'll see I'm getting a lot of long range kills here with just one three round burst that's all it takes because the game revolves around smaller tactical engagements there isn't a ton of background noise every now and then you hear you'll hear a helicopter fly overhead or maybe some long-distance explosion or something like that but it's not excessive so you can hear what's going around you with great clarity and you can hear footsteps people sneaking up and that's become a huge part of the game so when you're sneaking around you can absolutely anticipate running into people or moving into people there's no mini-map there's no way to bring up a map yeah there's basically this is it your heads-up display so you got to learn the maps and that's the learning curve of this game I would say if you're familiar with shooters it's not going to be too hard getting into it obviously the damage model is probably going to be new for most people but learning the map is the most important part of getting back into this game and getting good with it you'll notice that every time I fire the weapon there's a really cool smoke trail that comes off of the muzzle which is just all these cool little details that a lot of other games don't seem to have in them despite a lot of other games having huge production teams and massive attention to detail it's funny how insurgency captures some small things that nobody would really think about but ending up meaning a lot in the long run now without a doubt insurgency is rough around the edges especially if you're used to playing big triple-a titles the animation isn't the greatest for the characters the player models could definitely be better the map design could always look a little bit better but for a small game a small indie game they've really captured an element of gameplay that I haven't found in any other shooter even some of the shooters that try really hard to be a realistic insurgency does a great job of allowing you to get into the game quickly get into some combat not worry about just like stagnant gameplay and play with a realistic weapon model a realistic damage model engagements that seem to make more sense tactically than you would get from any other shooter it's sort of like ARMA meets counter-strike where you take the fast-paced nest of counter-strike the realistic gunplay of ARMA and then you kind of mix in some of the quickness of the menu and just getting started of counter-strike you don't have to worry about learning like five different stances before you can start playing the controls are very simple very straightforward you do also have leaning which is a nice touch you'll notice that there's no hipfire crosshair on the screen you can actually attach a laser sight to your weapon if you would like to try and simulate that hipfire accuracy if that's something that you would like to play with for the most part I found it to really not be a problem because I was aiming down sights for 95% of my kills anyway the game ships with 12 maps and it has several different game modes that are all kind of basic at first but they have really cool little twists on them that actually make a big difference one of them is wave respawning so the the conquest style game mode works very interestingly where you'll spawn and say your team's five guys those five guys can go and try and capture a point but if they all died then you lose the game now four of those five guys die and the last one captures the point your whole everybody who's dead on your team responds in as a wave so you're not responding in one at a time getting picked off you push out as a wave and sort of reinforce the map and I really like the wave respawning and just some of the cool little twists that they put on the game modes the player customization is very basic but it also makes a lot of sense you don't have a huge plethora of weapons to pick from you've got like an assault rifle a shorter carbine then you got like a sniper rifle and then some interesting little pdws but that's it you just kind of have one for each category for each team and it makes sense it makes you feel like you know this is the Arsenal that was available to this army you're not running around with all these kind of weird weapons you can also choose between having body armor but it's going to slow you down if you start wearing something that can potentially save you from a straight shot it can that make you survive one lucky hit and keep on fighting but if you want to move faster then you can certainly forego that you can also load out your soldier with different things you know more gear more equipments gonna weigh you down running with a machine gun will make you slower and in fact running around and jumping around makes your soldier tired not only will he breathe loudly which people can hear but your scope will sway so say you run to an objective as fast as possible crouch down and then try and scan the area you'll notice your scope is going to sway a lot around a lot more because you're breathing heavily and it's just the cool little details like this that really makes an insurgency a lot of fun to play it's just got core mechanics it sticks to them if anything you've seen here sounds like it would be fun to you then you're probably going to enjoy the game so check it out it's brand new let's try and get this indie title off the ground because I really think it has a lot to offer the FPS community as always guys thanks for watching and I'll see you next time this is level-cap signing

RKm160Qcnqs,Top Gear,"Automobile,Comedy",Nissan GTR Vs a Woman | Top Gear Festival Sydney,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKm160Qcnqs,7 years ago,19M views,"Automobile,Comedy","Now it's time for the big one,
the most important question in motoring. Which is faster, a Nissan GTR or a woman? Everywhere I go in the world
I'm asked this question. Well, today we're going
to find the answer, okay? So, first of all we need the car.
Let's bring it out. Nissan GTR, here it comes, purring along, 485 horsepower, four-wheel drive and in a 16-metre drag race,
the fastest road car in the world. I know, I've tested that. Unbelievable launch control and the only car that when
it accelerates, it actually hurts. Now, we're going to need a woman.
Now, don't worry. We haven't cheated We're not going to get some massive
dump truck in leggings to come along. Would you please put your hands together
for Michelle Jenneke... whose very sportingly wearing a bikini. Right, Michelle, you're a hurdelist. -Yes, I am a hurdler.
-A hurdler -Let me tell you how it goes.
-Okay. It's a 100-metre sprint. Now, how fast could you do
a 100 metres normally? -My best is 12:05.
-12:05. This is a little bit different.
We're going to start here on the line. We're going to race
to the 50-metre board there, which is by the 200-metre board
just to make it complicated. At the 50-metre board,
you will turn round and run back, -The start line is also the finish line.
-Got it. I will drive down, sitting down,
obviously, because I'm very, very lazy, to the 50-metre board, engage reverse,
not easy actually in a GTR, and then reverse and the winner is the one -who is the least run over.
-Okay Now, you have actually got a fairly
well-known to internet... boys routine for getting ready for a race. -Yes I do.
-You do your routine. I'm going to get in the GTR and do mine,
which is setting the launch control. -Okay
-All right, you do that. I know that a gentleman wouldn't use
launch control at a time like this, but I'm not a gentleman, so, I shall be. Okay, right. That's the warm-up routine.
You can see it on the internet. I'll just sit here
and just watch this, actually. Or should we have a race? Right. I'm in drive. I've got the three central buttons down.
I got to pull both paddles together. Left foot on the brake. Okay. Oh, yes I am in the lead! Past the 50-metre board, into reverse. Oh, she's back in the lead! Come on, car! Yes! Sorry about that. Loser! Ladies and gentlemen,
give her a massive round of applause for being a great sport. The question is, did Jeremy
organise that rather pointless race just so he could see
Michelle's warm-up routine? We'll never know",3:24
tCtal_f8nJI,TheWarOwl,VideoGames,Sidestep Shooting CSGO Tutorial,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCtal_f8nJI,9 years ago,2.1M views,VideoGames,greetings I the wore-out greets you and welcome to Counter Strike global Offensive 101 a series of tutorials aim to help gamers learn the basics of how to play Counter Strike global Offensive this time we'll be covering sidestep shooting it is a motion technique used to allow the player to have both evasive mobility as well as accuracy in shooting in Counter Strike global Offensive the hitboxes are actually smaller than the player models and the player models are a bit tiny compared to the maps as well this combined with the speed and acceleration that a player can strafe back and forth makes it difficult to get an accurate headshot in CS geo compared to other counter-strike titles and some other shooters it is important to take advantage of this strafing is when a player presses the a or D keys and walks side to side making them more difficult targets to hit and allowing them a full range of motion while aiming where they want first you should make your crosshair a dynamic crosshair this means that the size of the crosshair has a direct relationship to the current accuracy of the shot a number of different factors affect the accuracy of your shot and CS geo such as movement walking ducking and shooting all kinds of stuff it's important to have your crosshair on dynamic when learning this technique so that you have visual feedback on your accuracy the question is how do you shoot accurately while moving the key to sidestep shooting is to combine both the evasive power of strafing with the accuracy to shoot this is done by stopping first strafe back and forth we can times if we want to we're gonna leave y'all friends but sorry anyway notice that when you decide to turn around the actor is the indicator being how far apart the crosshair is goes down it is at this point when you are still that you are able to take a shot with the right accuracy this allows you to shoot accurately while also being evasive and is an important technique to learn when you decide to strafe in the other direction make sure to stop for less than a second so you're able to get one or two shots off act it takes some timing to get right as well as some practice in alternate technique to doing this is to use the shift key when you decide to stop the shift key makes you walk and when you're walking your accuracy is a little bit better than when you're running so you can straight back and forth and hit the shift key when you're ready to shoot I call this shift shooting and is something that I use personally good weapons to use this technique with or weapons that have a one hit kill head shot such as deagles in the ak-47 you should learn how to do it with both of these weapons a good question is if someone else is using this technique how do you counter it well if you're forced to engage them without you know head on without any deception you can either try to go for a head shot at the point where they stop to shoot you or you can spray your weapon and go for body shots and may be a lucky headshot if you're good enough to just shoot them no matter where they are and how they're moving such as following the targets or ambushing when they move past it then hey all the power to you my friends well I'm the war al and I still have no closer,3:18
Cln0J87vulU,OverSimplified,"Comedy,Informative",The War of the Bucket - OverSimplified,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cln0J87vulU,2 years ago,17M views,"Comedy,Informative","- [Narrator] Hey, you! Yeah, you! New merch available now, including a supremely uncool T-shirt and a glorious new character pin. Link in the description down below. (angelic harp music) ""All right, folks, gather round. I've got some good news
and some bad news."" ""Did you say good news and glad news?"" ""No. I said good news and
bad news, very bad news. Word on the street is there's
gonna be a horrible plague coming in from Central Asia
in the next couple decades that'll wipe out half of Europe."" ""What's the good news?
Do you have a cure?"" ""Please say you have a cure."" ""No. Even better. The good news is we've got a
new bucket for the city well."" (crickets chirping) (crowd cheering)
(joyful music) (loud boom) To understand the War of the Bucket, we first need to talk about this guy. He's the man with the plan,
the host with the most. He's holy, lowly, he eats ravioli with the white cassock,
matching pellegrina, and the most tasteful of fringed fascias. Come on. Y'all know who I'm talking about. It's the Pope, the head of the largest religious organization in the world. But what if I told you he wasn't always the big, bad boy powerhouse
he's often thought as today? That's right. Throughout history, the papacy
often found itself forced to wrestle against
adversity and opposition to retain its authority. The earliest popes, for example, suffered under the brutal
persecution of the Roman Empire, and many ended up martyred,
such as Pope Clement I, who was ostensibly thrown into the sea with an anchor around his neck. On the bright side, however, he's now the patron saint of fishermen. After persecution finally ended, the Pope still found himself
being heavily controlled by secular kings and nobility. For over two centuries
the Byzantine Emperor basically decided who could become Pope. Then came a real low point, during what has been cold in the Dark Age, a period where noblewomen
controlled the Pope through... How should I put this? Feminine charm. (whistles) It was around here that one infamous Pope, John XIII, took office. This bad boy would hold... How should I put this? Naughty no-clothes parties
in the Lateran Palace. And, apparently, this would even happen: ""C'mon Zeus! Give me a six! (dice rattling)
(gasps) Uh, did I say Zeus? I meant Thor. (gasps) Ra, the Egyptian sun god? (gasps) Dang it! Who is it we worship?"" ""Perhaps you should read
this, Your Holiness."" ""In the beginning, God created
the heavens and the earth? Wow! This is wild!"" Pope John XII eventually
died exactly how he lived: (door bangs) caught in the act by an irate husband who picked the pope up and
took him out the window. (explosion) The point I'm trying to make here is that often the Pope was a very weak and corruptible figure and was regularly used and
controlled by secular leaders as a tool to increase their
own power and influence. And there was certainly an
element of that in the year 800, when the Pope and the Kingdom
of the Franks were good BFFs. And king of the Franks,
Charlemagne, was like, ""Hey, man, being King of
the Franks is nice and all, but I want more legitimacy and also to become the
continuation of the Roman Empire. So what say in return for my protection you crown me emperor so
everyone will respect me more."" ""Sure thing pal. We'll
hold the ceremony tomorrow. Charlemagne, King of the Franks, I hereby crown you Emperor of the West."" ""Oh! Oh my goodness! I was not expecting this
at all. What a surprise! I simply cannot accept."" ""Oh. Okay then. I guess I'll just put
this back over here."" ""Give me that crown!"" Charlemagne's crowning as Emperor was certainly an historic moment, but it also created a bit
of an interesting problem: It set the precedent
that, from here on out, only the Pope could crown an emperor. But the Pope was also very
much under the influence and control of Charlemagne. So who really held the power
here? The Pope or the Emperor? I'm sure that this conflict
won't cause anyone... to die!
(dramatic music) ""Bishop of Freising, we want to thank you once again for visiting our wonderful city. It's been an honor."" ""The pleasure is all mine. And what a wonderful tour it's been. I've seen the city walls.
I've seen the towers. Nothing could top that."" ""Oh couldn't it? Because
we've saved the best for last! Tada!"" ""Oh. Yes, that's... very interesting."" ""Isn't it the greatest
thing you've ever seen?"" ""Well, I mean, it is just a bucket."" ""Get... him... outta here!"" (crowd jeering) (vegetables splatting) Over time, Charlemagne's
position as emperor and the Kingdom of the
Franks gradually evolved into the Holy Roman Empire. And by now, the Pope and the Emperor weren't such good friends anymore, since neither could agree
on who was the boss of who. To make matters worse,
the Emperor had taken to investing his own bishops and abbots. What does that mean? Well, allow me to explain. The problem for the Holy Roman Emperor was his empire wasn't really an empire, so much as a nightmarish federation made up of hundreds of counties, duchies, bishoprics and more. The princes in charge
of these local regions often didn't give the
Emperor their loyalty. The German nobility
spent a lot of their time rebelling against the Emperor, and the Emperor spent a lot of his time trying to put down those rebellions. ""Can we get rid of them?"" ""Who?"" ""All the nobility. Get rid of them in pick new
ones who are loyal to me."" ""You can't just remove noble
families from their territory."" ""Pwease."" ""Aw! Okay. How about this? Some of those territories are
ruled by bishops and abbots and as Holy Roman Emperor, considered by many to be the
deputy of Jesus Christ himself, perhaps you can choose who gets
to become bishop and abbot."" ""Yay!"" ""Now it's time to turn out
the lights and go to sleep."" ""Okay. I love you."" ""Um... okay. Goodnight."" ""Say it back!"" And so it was the Emperor
invested his own family and loyal followers into
powerful church positions and thereby was able to increase his own power and authority. Not only that, but the
Emperor and other nobility were also engaging in
something called simony. That's when someone
would come along and say, ""Hey, I want to become a bishop and get all the personal riches
that come with the position. Perhaps we could come to some kind of... (slam) arrangement."" That's right. Church positions were actually being sold to the highest bidder. And let me tell you, they
probably didn't come cheap. ""It's gonna cost you
a lot more than this."" ""I don't think so. I've got a promo code!"" And speaking of promo codes,

own authority and power!"" ""What about Jesus, Your Holiness?"" ""What?"" ""I thought the purpose of the church was to spread the good
message of Jesus Christ."" ""How drunk are you?"" ""Very!""
(cheering) ""All right, the results for the election of chief magistrate are in. Giovanni Kablami, 1%. Spaghetti Jeff, 2%. And the bucket, one trillion percent!"" (cheering)
(joyful music) Around the tear 1050, a series
reformist popes came along and they said enough was enough. They wanted to stop the
emperor from abusing the church and investing his own church officials. ""How are you gonna stop me so long as I have control
over who becomes pope? Remember the circular power division? If you try to stop me,
I'll just depose you and pick someone else. Oh no! I've contracted tuberculosis!"" (body thuds) And just like, the Emperor was dead. His six-year-old son, Henry IV, took over. And as we all know, child
emperors equal opportunity. The church had an opening to take back control of the papacy. ""Hey man, I hope you don't mind but we're changing the rules so that only the church of
cardinals can elect the pope and you no longer have
any say in the matter. Ya know, if that's cool with you."" ""I peed my pants."" ""Okay! Great talk!"" Then, with the position of
the pope a little more secure, he held a big meeting
where he drew up a big list of all the reforms and new
powers he was giving himself, and it included some pretty gnarly stuff. ""Okay, first, I have the
power to depose emperors. Everyone cool with that? Yeah? Um, let's see. Only I can depose or reinstate bishops. Yeah? All right. No one can judge me. Uh, all princes shall only kiss my feet. Only my name shall be
spoken in the churches. My name is the only name in the world!"" ""Okay. I think you're done."" These were all some pretty radical powers the Pope was giving himself. And with these reforms, the pope was basically telling the Emperor you no longer have the right to choose your own bishops and abbots. Only I can do that. When the emperor, now a full-grown man, heard the news, he was furious. ""What? This is madness! Who does this guy think he is? I'm the emperor for goodness sake! He can't tell me what to do! I'll invest my own bishops
and abbots if I want to, and this rapscallion can go right to heck! I peed my pants again!"" The whole conflict escalated
when Henry IV went to the pope and said, ""Hey, guess what, sucker. You're deposed."" ""Aw. Wait a minute! I'm the Pope! You can't depose me! You're deposed!"" ""Aw. Wait a minute! I'm the Emperor! You can't depose me! You're deposed!"" ""Aw. Wait a minute!"" Eventually, the German
princes took advantage of the situation, and they
all turned against Henry. Henry was forced to apologize to the pope, and the whole thing ended there. Except it didn't. The whole conflict, known today as the
Investiture Controversy, would continue on for centuries as popes and emperors
engaged in a power struggle over the emperor choosing
his own church officials. The overall result of this
conflict is very intricate and full of complexities. But in general, the pope was
able to increase his authority. ""Great news, Your Holiness. Your influence is on the rise
throughout civilized Europe. Except for this one
city in northern Italy."" ""Really? What's going on there?"" (men chanting) As for the Emperor, he found his realm thrown into further chaos and civil war, as the local princes continued
to increase their own power and independence. This was most notably the
case in northern Italy, separated from the rest
of the Holy Roman Empire by the Alps. The Emperor's influence
and control over Italy had often been questionable. In the current chaos,
these Italian city-states began operating almost
entirely independently. Their practical independence
was further solidified when Emperor Frederick
Barbarossa came down in 1176 to try to reassert his control. The cities formed an alliance and with the pope's support, they kicked the emperor
right back to Germany. ""Hooray,"" said the Italian
city-states. ""We did it! We're the best of friends!"" And then they immediately
began attacking each other. (swords clanging) Why? Well, this whole
pope-versus-emperor thing, in Italy at least, had infiltrated society to it's very core. Across Italy, families
and cities were torn between two opposing sides; on one side, the Guelphs, who
supported the pope's cause; on the other, the Ghibellines,
who supported the emperor. These two sides struggled for control as Guelph cities battled
against Ghibelline ones. As usual, personal interest
played a pretty big role as pro-pope Guelph cities tended
to be rich mercantile ones who didn't like the emperor's taxes. Emperor-supporting
Ghibellines, on the other hand, were often agricultural, where the expanding papal
states were a larger threat. These cities would
sometimes even switch sides, depending who was in charge and their ever-changing
personal interests. In some cities, brutal fighting
broke out in the streets as opposing families fought for control. At times, the conflict became so tribal that the differences between the two sides were just downright silly. ""My love, I can't bear
it. We must be together. But how can we? My Ghibelline family wears feathers on the left side of their caps, and your Guelph family
wears them on the right. My Ghibelline family
cuts fruit straight down, and your Guelph family
cuts fruit crosswise."" ""These are arbitrary differences. We shouldn't let them tear us apart. We can be together no matter
what our families think."" ""Wonderful news! Let's
make a toast to our love. I'll drink from my
Ghibelline smooth goblet."" ""And I shall drink from
my Guelph chased goblet."" (music cuts off) ""Get out of my sight you
dirty Pope-loving wench."" Two city-states in particular that got caught a long-standing rivalry was the emperor-supporting Modena and the pope-supporting,
bucket-loving Bologna. These two cities had
bad blood between them, as they had already
fought against each other on a number of occasions. In 1249, the two sides took
part in the Battle of Fossalta, after which the victorious Bolognese launched a live donkey into
Modena to humiliate them. For decades after that, the two sides would occasionally
take little day trips into each other's territory
and mess things about a bit. In the fateful year of 1325, the Bolognese went on one such trip and laid waste to some farmlands. The ruler of Modena,
Passerino dei Bonacolsi, was having none of it. The Bolognese had two major forts protecting their city in the southwest, so Passerino, in retaliation, decided to take an army down
and lay siege to one of them. ""Hey, you dirty Bolognese jerks! You think you can raid our farmlands? Come out here and face me like a man!"" ""Hey man, what's up? I've just come out to let you know that there's no need to siege us because- (smack) Whoa! Hey man! Chill out! I'm trying to tell you- (smack) Whoa! Stop doing that! I'm trying to tell you I'm
actually secretly sympathetic to the imperial cause, and I want to willingly
hand the fort over to you."" ""Oh. Cool. Okay.""
(smack) ""Dude! What was that for?"" ""For betraying your people. And this... is for joining mine. Mwah."" The Bolognese were pretty unhappy to lose one of their main defensive forts. But to make matters
worse, then this happened. ""Hey, wait a minute. Where's the bucket?"" ""Oh no! It's gone!"" ""Those Modenese must have taken it!"" ""We'll make them pay!
This is unacceptable! They may take our lives,
they may take our fort, but they will never take our bucket! Oh wait, here it is. I found it guys. It's right here. Phew. Could you imagine if we
started a war over that? That would have been really stupid, and there'd probably be
a billion videos about it on YouTube one day. Thank goodness it never
actually happened."" That's right. The famous story you may know
about the War of the Bucket, that the war started because
Modena stole Bologna's bucket, doesn't actually seem to be quite right. I was surprised to find that the bucket was likely not actually stolen
at the start of the war. And at this point, I want to
thank and give a big shout out to fellow history YouTuber M Laser. He's the one guy I found
who actually translated a fantastic original Italian source and then kindly allowed me to use his work in my own research. He does really well-researched
and in-depth videos and definitely deserves
way more subscribers. So please head on over and check him out. The real reason Bologna seems
to have declared war on Modena is simply that they both hated each other, supported opposing factions, the Pope had called on Guelph
cities to attack Passerino, and Bologna wanted its fort back. And they were gonna get it back. Bologna had a large force, much larger than what
Modena could muster up, so they felt pretty confident. They sent half they're force to lay siege and take back the fort, and the other half took
defensive positions to prevent the Modenese
from crossing the river. The smaller Modenese force were struggling to find a place to cross, so one night they were
like, ""Hey guys, look out. We're attacking way up here in the north. Better move your troops. Oh, would you look at.
That that was easy."" And just like that, the
Modenese were across the river. The Bolognese were probably
expecting the Modenese to come and break their siege. But instead, the Modenese
went for the second fort at Zappolino. Bologna couldn't afford to lose
both of its defensive forts, so the entire Bolognese force moved to take defensive
positions at Zappolino. When the Modenese arrived, it
was already late in the day, and there were about two
hours of sunlight left. In most medieval battles, at this point both sides would set up a
camp, rest for the night, and prepare for battle the next day. But the outnumbered Modenese decided the only way to win was to
deal a quick decisive blow while the Bolognese were still
unorganized and unprepared. And that's exactly what they did. They charged at the Bolognese line, and the two sides
engaged in fierce combat. (swords clanging) Then the sneaky Modenese pulled what must be the most predictable yet somehow consistently surprising move in medieval warfare. They sent the cavalry around the side and hit 'em from behind. Bing, bang, bong. The
Bolognese went on the run. With casualties in the thousands, Modena had won. (army cheering) And the Modenese cavalry
chased the Bolognese cavalry all the way back to the city. After Modena's victory,
they went on a tour of the Bolognese countryside, burning some stuff down along the way. When they reached the city itself, instead of laying siege,
they set up a camp and basically held a massive
party for three days. The defeated Bolognese could
only sit back and watch as the Modenese force began packing up and getting ready to leave. They noticed something. ""Oh my gosh. Hey! Check this out!"" ""No way! Are you kidding me? ""They're still using traditional wells!"" ""Hey you dumb Bolognese, ever
heard of an artesian well? You can't even get water out of the ground without using a stupid bucket."" ""It's not a stupid bucket.
It's a wonderful bucket!"" ""Yeah, whatever bucket boy. We're taking this with us."" (man screaming) So Modena stole Bologna's bucket and put it up on display
in their cathedral, eventually moving it to the city hall, where it remains on display to this day. The two cities came to a peace settlement a few months later. Bologna would have to pay
heavy war reparations, and in exchange, Modena would return all conquered territories. Modena kept the bucket. Despite being one of the bloodiest battles in medieval Italian history, it didn't really change anything, except now Modena had Bologna's bucket. As for the larger power struggle between the Pope and
the Holy Roman Emperor, that would continue on for some time and played a part in many major
events of medieval history, such as the Crusades, the
Protestant Reformation, eventually leading to
the general separation of church and state we
see in Europe today. So there you have it. We learnt about the Pope
and the Holy Roman Emperor, the Investiture Controversy, and finally the War of the Bucket. It's been a long day, and it's
time to turn out the lights, and go to sleep. ""Okay. I love you."" ""Um, okay. Goodnight."" ""Say it back!"" (upbeat R&B music)",18:40

fTgm36y884c,Epicurious,Food,How To Cut Every Cheese | Method Mastery | Epicurious,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgm36y884c,9 months ago,10M views,Food,[Music] hi i'm anne saxleby founder and co-owner of saxelby cheese mongers and i'm here today to show you how to serve every cheese we're going to talk about how to cut serve and store cheeses and what are the best accompaniments to serve each cheese with [Music] parmigiano-reggiano aka the king of cheese so this is probably the best known example of a cooked pressed cheese cooked pressed cheeses are cooked to higher temperatures they tend to be quite firm and are aged for a very long time to best serve parmigiano-reggiano you would likely want to use a small hard cheese knife like this one it's really great for getting at hard cheeses to either slice them or kind of chisel them off so to cut this parmigiano reggiano i'm just going to get right in there and chisel this cheese off along its natural fault lines this is one of the most fun cheeses to cut and serve because you don't have to worry about creating smooth even slices you can see these little white crystalline bits and these crystals are actually clusters of proteins or amino acids that recalcified during the aging process so the longer the parmigiano reggiano ages the more intense and kind of ubiquitous those protein clusters will be when serving parmigiano-reggiano or really any cheese you want to serve it at room temperature cheeses taken right out of the fridge can actually have flavors that seem a little muted or almost stunted and that's because the cold really kind of locks up the fat where the flavor lives so when you're serving a cheese at room temperature you're allowing the flavor to really fully express itself when you're planting a party or a cheese board a great general rule of thumb is two ounces of cheese per person both parmigiano-reggiano and balsamic vinegar come from the same region of italy if it grows together it goes together parmesan reggiano is a very rich aged cheese and it has buttery flavors toasty flavors brothy flavors it's wonderfully salty and so an aged balsamic it brings a little bit of acidity fruitiness of course and also just a touch of sweetness that really offsets everything wonderful about the cheese so you can literally just drizzle a bit on there and then dunk the cheese in another thing that you compare parmesan reggiano with is fresh fruit like fresh figs again because the figs are sweet but not too sweet and have kind of an earthy character as well it just makes a fantastic pairing with the cheese this is gruyere possibly switzerland's most famous cheese gruyere is also an alpine style cheese so alpine style refers to any cheeses that are made in the alps or made in the same style of cheese that are made in the alps alpine style cheeses like gruyere or raclette are fabulous melters so even though this is a very big slice you can get a nice little slice off even with a tiny knife like this so long as it's sharp if you need to balance your knife you can do so with the front finger as well as the back one the rind of gruyere is actually not so pleasant people always ask when do you eat the rind of different cheeses and the answer is basically this unless the rind is made from wax bark or cloth you can always eat it it's just up to you whether or not you like the taste i would cut the rind off in a slice like this to serve the gruyere with a cheese planer you literally take the wedge and you drag the cheese planer across and you get these wonderful thin papery slices an architect friend of mine once said that everything in life is about surface area and when you're talking about a cheese like this is a hundred percent true i would challenge anybody who's watching this video to slice this cheese both ways taste both and note the differences in a bigger chunk like this it's super rich but also very fudgy and very dense and very hearty conversely when you eat one of these little paper thin slices it literally melts on your tongue so good you can put it out on a cheese board with full grain mustard and cornichons and maybe also some bread on the side and it is delicious havarti denmark's most famous cheese here we have a havarti actually with some dill in it because it's made from whole cow's milk and because it has kind of a fresh creamy milky flavor pretty much anything you pair with it is going to be great havarti tends to be semi-firm very pliant almost a little bit buttery so it's not quite as cooked and not quite as pressed when serving a variety it's great to use just a simple sharp chef's knife and i cannot overstate how important it is to have at least one sharp knife in your house when you're slicing the havarti it's best to literally just start at the end and make some clean even slices there's really nothing fancy havarti is i think the world's ultimate snacking cheese we've chosen to pair it with crackers which is a very simple but effective pairing butter cracker and seeded cracker with avarti simple is best this is raclette this cheese isn't quite as firm as the other cooked pressed cheeses we've seen like parmigiano-reggiano or gruyere but it shares with gruyere its meltability raclette was really built to melt in fact the verb racclay in french means to scrape because the traditional way to serve this cheese is actually to melt it and scrape it on top of roasted potatoes or bread roclet is a raw cow's milk cheese meaning that it's made from milk that hasn't been pasteurized raw milk cheese when it's made from milk that is coming from healthy animals and being produced in sanitary facilities not only makes tastier cheeses but is arguably better for our bodies too i like to start by slicing a little bit off the front and then cut rectangular shaped wedges off the back the rind of rucklette is absolutely delicious put those onto these paddles here and put them under this reclip machine what we have here is a machine that has a little heat lamp essentially under this grill top and so the cheese is actually going to be broiled this is a cheese fork which would usually be used to pick up and spear little pieces of cheese on a cheese plate but for this instance while the raclette is cooking and bubbling here on these paddles i'm going to put boiled potatoes and the salami onto the top of the reclip machine so that gets nice and hot and it's tempting to pour the cheese off before it's fully cooked but it's really really worth waiting until you can actually see the cheese almost kind of jumping around the cheese is melted until it's almost translucent and these big undulating bubbles are forming so that tells me it's the right time so i'm going to put some of my potatoes on the plate here as well as this salami and this is the moment everyone waits for you pour the roclet onto the salami and potatoes in a nice buttery sheet and voila your perfect plate of raclette is ready this is tet de moan a raw cow's milk cheese from switzerland and the thing that makes tetuan different and distinctive is its shape and size so it has the signature nuttiness of the cooked pressed cheese family but it's also washed with brine which makes it a little bit more pungent and a little funky in french the word for rind is krute which means crust it's kind of like the crust of the bread but it's the crust of the cheese with cheeses like this that are more aged the rind can be pretty strong and pretty earthy it's not going to be the tastiest to eat so we're going to remove that part and i'm using my chef's knife and just rocking it back and forth slowly to try to get a nice even cut in french tetemuan means head of the monk the swiss when they invented this cheese it reminded them of seeing the top of a monk's head because monks would traditionally shave the top of their head and leave a little ring of hair around the outside there is a special way to serve tetanuan that deserves recognition this little contraption is called a gerol and it was invented solely to serve this cheese so now what we're going to do is i'm going to try to find the middle and then with gentle even pressure push the wheel down until it rests on the bottom this can't be done with just any cheese if you tried to stick a different cheese that was more acidic onto this blade it will crumble and fall apart so now what we're going to do is put the blade down here onto the pin and start twirling and as we twirl you can see these beautiful little florets of cheese starting to form a nice little flowery shape i'm going to make another one for good measure if you don't eat the whole wheel of cheese which is understandable because there's quite a lot of it you can always take the rest of the cheese and store it in your refrigerator since cheese is a delicate matrix of fat water and protein if you put it in the freezer it denatures that balance and it's going to change the texture so always store your cheese in the fridge either in foil or parchment paper we deliberately chose not to pair the tatam one with anything these delicate florets of cheese they just melt in your mouth and really express the flavor of this cheese it is just delicious that texture is absolutely unique this is swallowtail tome our first uncooked pressed cheese uncooked pressed cheeses are cooked to slightly lower temperatures during the cheese making process and they are consequently a little bit softer in texture and age a little bit faster so the swallowtail tome is also an example of a tome style cheese a category of cheese that is semi-firm a little bit sour in texture that are covered with this beautiful earthy rind and this is really just the ambient mold that grows in the cave where the cheese is aging it might look a little scary or a little crazy but the rinds of cheeses like the swallow tail tone add a very pleasant earthiness to the character of the cheese when you're slicing the swallow tail tone and really when you're slicing any cheese you should start from the center and kind of cut even slices that radiate out from the center all cheeses ripen from the outside in the molds and bacteria and fungi that are present on the rind actually break down the fat and the protein in the cheese and create flavor and ripen it over time the outside of the cheese is going to be the first part to ripen and the inside of the cheese is going to be the last part to ripen so when you cut an even slice that has an even distribution of outside and inside you're going to be tasting kind of the full spectrum of flavor i said i like to eat the rind but i don't like to eat all the rind again this is personal preference but what i would do is cut off this big chunk of rind here and leave a little bit on the back and though i wouldn't normally eat it like this if i was eating it myself i would start here and probably end up here just to demonstrate how delicious this rind is i'm going to start with the rind first [Music] the rind is absolutely delicious it's kind of like the crust of bread we've chosen to pair cherries with the swallow tail tone these cheeses tend to be kind of tart and yogurty so just as you can imagine eating fresh cherries with your yogurt it's a beautiful pairing with the cheese this is goat tone this is another example of an uncooked pressed cheese this goat tome has a beautiful earthy rind that's actually dappled with yellow molds as well when the cheese maker started making this cheese he didn't necessarily intend for this exact mold to be on the surface but when he built his cellar and put the young wheels of cheese down there this was the type of mold that grew on the surface and over the years has become kind of the signature molds of his farm and his cheeses we can take a nice thin slice and i'm going to again i'm going to cut the rind off of one side but i'm going to leave the rind on the back it's wonderful to have the interplay of different flavors that come from different fermented foods of course bread and salami are both examples of cured fermented foods and then to top it off we have some sweet cherry preserves which just add a touch of sweetness [Music] this is bismarck a cloth-bound sheep's milk cheddar that's made in vermont and aged in brooklyn bismarck is a cloth-bound sheep's milk cheddar and so it has the same characteristics that you would expect from a cheddar it's sharp it's tangy it's a little bit nutty sheep's milk has about twice the butter fat of cow or goat's milk in it it adds a roundness to the cheese and a fullness on the palate and it also adds for lack of a better word a slightly sheepy flavor to the overall cheese the tradition of binding cheddar in cloth is definitely one that dates back to the 1800s it allows the cheese to breathe which allows it to develop different distinctive flavors and it also protects it if any cheese is coated with wax cloth or bark you do not want to eat the rind so to make this cheese a little bit easier to slice we can actually just peel the cloth coating off of it and if i'm going to use my chef knife and try to make a long even cut i can slice it like this if i want to use the smaller knife it's going to be difficult to get kind of an even longer slice but you can also cut little chunks off the front that are going to be perfectly tasty cheddar is a wonderful cheese to serve with apples and dried raisiny grapes the sharpness and the tart qualities of the cheese are a perfect foil to kind of the crisp acidity and the juiciness of the apples this is shelburne cheddar a raw cow's milk cheddar from vermont cheddar cheeses can be bound in cloth and cave-aged or they can also be aged in cryovac aging the cheese in the cryovac bags means that it's aging without oxygen which results in a cheddar that has a very toothsome fudgy dense texture and a very potent sharp flavor to me that always leans a little bit more towards an oniony or allium sharpness when i slice the shelburne cheddar i always like to slice in thin slices and then cut into squares or into rectangles rather than cubes for me a big cube of cheddar can just be a little bit overwhelming cheddar cheese especially ones like this shelburne cheddar are so versatile in the kitchen you can cook with these as well as put them on a cheese board you can do things like grilled cheese mac and cheese nachos chili the world is your oyster i like to pair cheddar cheeses like this with dried fruits and fresh fruits like dried apricots and these fresh purple grapes [Music] this is manchego this is an example of a waxed cheese you can see that the rind is coated with a very thin paraffin wax and it's also got this distinctive basket pattern on the outside which is a signature element of manchego manchego is a pure sheep's milk cheese that's made in spain and it's a name protected cheese meaning it has to be made within a certain geographic region when you slice a block of manchego like this you can do it from top to bottom sometimes it can be intimidating to cut a big slice of cheese like this i'm going to show you how to do it just so you know and then i'm going to show you another way it's really important to line up the knife so that you have a good amount overhanging the front that you can press your fingers down onto this is going to give you the confidence you need to slice through this kind of firm tall wedge of cheese so you just use even pressure on the front and the back all the way down if that seems like it's too tall or too difficult or too crazy or whatever another way to slice this manchego would be to turn it on its side and cut the bottom rind off and cut the cheese into more triangular slices you could even slice them in half again to make them a little bit more narrow you could choose to leave this rind on the back or if you don't trust people not to eat it you could do them the service of cutting it off the most classic quintessential pairing for manchego is membrillo membrillo is actually a jelly that is made from the cooked pulp of the quince fruit the cheese is so dense it's buttery it's nutty it's a little sheepy and wooly for lack of a better word and then when you pair it with this intense sweetness of the quince it forms this incredible mouthful this is an aged gouda that has been aged between 12 and 18 months made from raw cow's milk gouda originates in holland and actually takes its name from the town of gouda which is actually pronounced hauda young gouda tends to be creamy and buttery and mild but the longer gouda ages the sweeter it gets this is a medium aged example i would say between 12 and 18 months but gouda can be aged as long as five or even seven years back in the day when the dutch were trading with everybody all over the world they were also the first to export their cheeses and their butter overseas they discovered coating the cheese in wax sealed in the moisture allowed the cheese to age for a longer time and protected it during the long and kind of arduous voyage the wax coating also makes the resulting cheese creamier because no oxygen can get in all of that moisture and creaminess is trapped inside the wheel as it's aging you could cut it like this off the front or you could also cut it like this from front to back if you're going to slice it with a cheese plainer you can drag the cheese slicer over it like this and serve the cheese this way and in extra aged goudas that sweetness can translate to an almost kind of butterscotchy dulce de leche or toffee kind of flavor so i've decided to pair the gouda with something equally sweet as almost kind of a dessert course so there's both dark chocolate and toffee the dark chocolate is an incredible match for this cheese because the tannic rich earthiness as well as the slight sweetness are a perfect foil to that dulce de leche caramelly sweetness in the cheese and the toffee also creates a really formidable pairing because of the toasted nuts and the caramelized sugars [Music] this is brie which is a part of the bloomy rhine or mold ripen cheese family when we talk about bloomy rind or mold ripened cheeses we're talking about any cheese that is covered with this kind of white fluffy mold or a white wrinkly mold which is actually beneficial totally safe to eat and very tasty the mold that grows on the outside of the cheese is literally breaking down the fat and the protein in the cheese and ripening it from the outside in so when we're serving a bloomy rind or mold ripened cheese the best tool to use is a sharp knife i have a boning knife which is a very narrow and sharp blade and then i have this soft cheese knife which has some holes in it as well as a fork at the top which you can use to spear the piece of cheese that you've just cut and serve it so when you're cutting into a cheese like this you can either start by cutting it in half and then taking kind of slices out of it almost like you would a cake or a pie or a pizza or you can start by taking sort of a pac-man type wedge out of the middle i'm going to start by doing that because that can make for a fun presentation on a cheese board you cut a little bit of the cheese but then you can allow your guests to see the interior of the cheese the center is still a little bit firmer and even has some little holes in it where the places that are closer to the exterior of the cheese are a little softer and gooier and have started to break down i recommend taking the cheese out about an hour before you're going to serve it if you forget and don't have an hour a quick cheat is to turn your oven on to like 300 or so and turn it off and then stick your cheese in there just for a few minutes and take it out and that will allow it to warm up a little bit you can pair brie with many different kinds of accompaniments but today i've chosen strawberry which adds a pop of really vibrant beautiful red color as well as sweetness which really goes well with the kind of buttery and creamy quality of the cheese as well as this honey mixed with toasted hazelnuts and pistachios the sweetness of the honey and the saltiness and crunch of the toasted nuts really offset the creamy buttery qualities of brie this is camembert camembert is known for its gooey buttery texture as well as for its oftentimes pungent flavor and aroma aromas of certain bloomy rind cheeses like this camembert have been described as being part of the brassica family so similar to broccoli or cauliflower or sometimes even cabbage which sounds crazy until you smell arita cheese like this and then you realize that there's actually some of those funky pungent earthy flavors there to show you the difference between how two similar bloomy rind cheeses ripen i wanted to show the brie that we just served as well as the camembert that you see here so this is my wheel of brie which you can see is a younger cheese and the reason you can see that is because the rind is very white very even very smooth and has a very mellow to non-existent aroma this camembert on the other hand is very ripe and you can see that the rind looks quite different there are some spots of white but also spots of brown and yellow and when you smell the rind it has a much more intense pungent flavor and that's how you can tell that this camembert is more ripe and is also going to taste stronger to serve this camembert i've chosen pecans and pears the pecans are of course going to add a little bit of crunch but also a little bit of a sweet toasty flavor and the pear is going to add a little bit of a crisp acidity along with a mild sweetness i'm going to cut it in half and you can see that this camembert is quite ripe the interior of the cheese is kind of uniformly gooey which means that the cheese is fully ripened from the outside in this is going to mean that the camembert has a really nice full intense flavor so you can smear a dollop of the camembert right on top of this pecan or you can also serve a little bit on top of a slice of pear this is kupole an example of a bloomy rind or mold ripen goat's milk cheese the rind of this koopal is completely edible goat's milk for lack of a better word has a musky or almost goaty flavor to it i happen to love goat cheese when serving soft bloomy rind or mulripen cheeses you can use a boning knife or a soft cheese knife or you can also pick up a kind of fancier tool like this this is called a harp wire it just makes you look like a pro you can literally just cut through the center of the cheese and look at that it's just like a beautiful perfect cut and from there you can slice and dice the cheese in many different ways and get very accurate and very beautiful slices bloomy rind goat's milk cheeses like koopal have kind of a lactic quality to them which for me kind of equates to a yogurty fresh taste and so when you're serving cheese like that it's nice to have some bright accompaniments i've chosen the marmalade which of course has very citrusy and zesty and bright flavors as well as fresh figs which are going to be juicier and a little bit sweeter and then these dried fruit and nutcrackers which also complement the goat's milk flavors i'm going to make a bite a perfect bite of the koopal goat cheese on the cracker and with a little dollop of marmalade on top [Music] this is gorgonzola the most famous italian blue cheese blue cheeses like gorgonzola are very recognizable because they are full of these beautiful blue veins contrary to what many people believe blue cheeses are not injected with this blue mold rather the cheese maker will pierce the cheese or poke holes in it and the oxygen that's entering the cheese allows the blue mold to grow so here we can actually see in this piece of gorgonzola there are different holes here and that is literally the cheese maker coming along with a stainless steel spike and spiking the cheese in order to let that blue grow the blue mold is delicious and edible this knife is a special italian blue cheese knife that i picked up on my travels to italy it allows you to slice through the cheese and then when you get to the bottom of the cheese it's not going to get stuck on the table forcing you to kind of wiggle it around is going to allow you to just create a beautiful cut and you'll see that when i've cut through the blue a little bit of cheese does get stuck to the surface of the knife but the thinness of the blade is designed to minimize that i chose to serve the gorgonzola with honeycomb which is of course a sweet pairing as well as toasted walnuts so i'm going to use my soft cheese knife and slice myself off a little wedge of blue this piece really doesn't have much blue veining i'm going to cheat and cut myself a piece that has a nice little vein of blue in it because i happen to really enjoy that earthy stronger flavor put that on the bread and then i'm going to use the soft cheese knife to slice into the honeycomb honeycomb tends to be a little expensive but it is totally worth it if you want to kind of go all out and create a really fun beautiful cheese board this is roquefort arguably the most famous blue cheese in the world roquefort is a french blue cheese made from raw sheep's milk and was one of the first cheeses to receive an aoc or dop name protection meaning that the cheese can only be made in a certain region from a certain breed of sheep and following certain specifications following how the cheese is made roquefort has an absolutely irresistible buttery texture the flavors imparted by the blue mold include kind of creamy fruity peppery and earthy flavors that just combine to make this cheese absolutely unique and incredible when you're cutting roquefort or other blue cheeses it can be tricky to do because they can crumble easily i'm going to cut the cheese with the harp wire and look how easily i can slice this cheese and it just creates a perfectly even wedge from there i'm going to cut slices like this oftentimes with blue cheeses you will see a slight rosy or pinkish color under the rhine it's just a natural result of the ripening process i've decided to serve the roquefort today with a classic combo a french baguette and butter blue cheese can be kind of contentious and many people think that all blue cheeses are going to be very strong very intense and that they don't like them but if you mellow out the blue cheese with a little bit of butter you are just going to be in heaven not going to be fancy about this literally going to rip the baguette open any butter will do but if you can find good butter at the supermarket it might be worth investing in slightly fancier butter than usual butter can be just as complex and delicious as cheese i'm not gonna go there all the way right now but the importance of good butter cannot be underestimated so i'm literally going to take my butter smear it on my bread and roquefort can be kind of sticky and a little stinky and kind of mess up your fingers so this is a great excuse to use the little fork on the end of your cheese knife you can literally pick up the wedge like this put it on your bread and dig in [Music] this is a plus a wash rind cow's milk cheese from france washed rind cheeses are the stinkers of the cheese family they are easily recognizable because they tend to have reddish or orangey rinds and of course when you smell them there's some pungency and some really aromatic things happening there wash rind cheeses can be washed with any number of things the most common thing is a saltwater brine but beer wine or any kind of spirits also work as well a plus happens to be washed with marked bregon which is a special spirit that is made from the pressed red grapes from burgundy wine so this special wash helps to develop a distinctive and rich flavor with wash rind cheeses like applause you definitely want to eat the rind the rind is a very important and integral part of the flavor the cheese becomes tremendously gooey and runny as it ages if you take it out of the box there's a chance that it's going to get stuck to the box and will be kind of awkward to get out and you don't even need to do that because to serve this you can simply dig in a cheese spreader scoop out a dollop and put it onto something like bread or in this case we've chosen potato chips an unconventional cheese pairing perhaps there's kind of a high-low thing happening here with the fancy cheese but it is so satisfying it plus tends to be creamy fruity and a little bit barnyardy and by barnyardy i mean you can kind of taste the cow but in a good way and so having that salty toasty potato chip to serve it on is a perfect match take your gooey dollop of applause put it on your potato chip and watch the fireworks happen in your brain when you eat it this is winemere a raw cow's milk wash rind cheese made in vermont the thing that makes it distinctive and special is the fact that it's wrapped in this spruce bark this is a tradition that originated in france and switzerland with cheeses like vacheron montour and forster caisa so windermere is a seasonal cheese it's only available each year from january through april because the farmers want to use that butter fat rich winter milk to make it the bark is actually from the cambium layer of the tree which is not the hard outer bark rather it is the soft inner bark just below the surface that actually is used for nutrients to travel up and down the soft inner bark is harvested from the trees cut into strips and then dried before it's put onto each wheel the cheese makers will sanitize it by boiling it and boiling it also makes it flexible again they then wrap the spruce bands around the cheese and put a little rubber band around them to keep them from falling off during the aging process the bark permeates the cheese and really creates a wonderful array of flavors from smoked meat to pine to juniper and sometimes even a mustardy flavor windermere is an example of a cheese where you do not want to eat the rind around the outside so to serve winemere or any bark wrap cheese the best way to do it is to cut the top rind off and i'm just using a sharp chef's knife to do this and then you literally can peel the top rind away and from there the interior of the cheese is almost like a custardy cheese pudding and i am literally going to unabashedly dig in with a spoon smear it on a baguette and chow down this cheese is so rich and complex and delicious that a simple sliced baguette is all it needs [Music] this is mozzarella mozzarella is a fresh cheese they're the simplest cheeses to make they take the least amount of time to age and they're the most simple in flavor in italy in order to call the cheese mozzarella it has to be made from the milk of the water buffalo if the mozzarella is made from cow's milk it's called fiora de latte so technically all of our american mozzarella is actually fiordi latte you can slice and serve mozzarella in a few different ways the simplest way of course is to use your chef's knife and you can simply slice it like this another way that you can cut the mozzarella if you don't want to slice it with a knife is using a box grater it's one of the best cheese tools you can have this side over here has these wider openings that are perfect for shredding mozzarella if you're going to be plating it the way that i am today making a little caprese salad you probably don't need to use this because it makes such thin slices but if you're going to be using the mozzarella to make dishes like lasagna or topping a pasta that you're going to bake in the oven this is a great tool to use because you're going to get nice feathery even light slices which are great for baking the thinner they are the quicker they're going to bake and they'll get kind of browned and bubbly on the top but for today i'm going to plate the mozzarella in a very simple way with fresh tomatoes and basil and finally you can dust it with a little bit of sea salt you drizzle a little bit of olive oil on top and voila this is ricotta ricotta is one of the world's most popular fresh cheeses the ricotta that i have here today is made from whole cow's milk but ricotta can be made from sheep's milk goat's milk water buffalo milk just about any milk you choose since ricotta is such a simple and versatile fresh cheese you can serve it with a lot of different things both sweet and savory but today i've decided to serve this ricotta with a little bit of buckwheat honey and lemon zest to turn it into a sweeter almost a breakfasty type of dish so we're going to start by drizzling the buckwheat honey onto the ricotta and then i'm going to zest a little bit of lemon on top of that just give it a little bit of acidity and added character and after i'm going to use a cheese spreader here smear it on a fresh baguette and enjoy this is fresh chev or fresh goat cheese fresh cheeses of this kind were probably among the first cheeses that humans ever made dates make a wonderful pairing for a chev take your cheese spreader or soft cheese knife dig in you can literally just scoop the fresh chev into the middle of the date the date provides all the sweetness you need and the cheese being so tangy and tart it makes a wonderful and contrasting pairing this is burrata arguably one of everyone's favorite cheeses but i'm gonna let you in on a little secret the reason people love burrata is actually because of what's inside the burrata burrata is mozzarella that is stretched and shaped into a purse and then filled with strachatella and what is stratchitella strings of mozzarella in salted heavy cream the problem was how do you get these strings of mozzarellas in salted heavy cream to the person who's going to be using it and someone came up with the genius idea of forming a pouch of mozzarella and literally stuffing it full of this delicious stuff so i'm going to cut into the paratha with a boning knife you'll notice that wonderful stratchitella coming out i love to serve burrata with prosciutto which is of course a classic italian cured ham and a little bit of bread so i'm literally going to take the bread cut a nice generous slice of burrata try to cup the cheese like this so that all of the good creamy inside of the cheese doesn't spill out everywhere and you can put that on top of your slice of bread dress it up with a few little bits of prosciutto sprinkle it with a little salt and pepper and finally you can drizzle a little olive oil on top and your perfect bite of burrata is ready to go this is provola provola is a fresh cheese that is part of the pasta filata family but the difference between provola and other pasta filata cheeses is that it is firmer and a little bit more aged provola and provolone are related the only difference is that provola is a smaller loaf like this and provolone tends to be very large format proviles when slicing provola or cheeses like this a chef's knife is the best tool to use because the cheese is actually quite firm and so you're going to want a larger knife to help you cut all the way through it i'm going to slice off kind of the end piece here you can actually eat this cheese outside and all but it's going to be a little bit dry for making a sandwich with i would take this cheese and grate it and turn it into a macaroni and cheese shaved over top of salad or shaved over pasta but so we're going to take our provolla make nice thin slices if possible layer it onto my bread here top with a little bit of salami or soprasada and make myself a little sandwich this is queso fresco a mild fresh cow's milk cheese from mexico that can be used in a wide variety of dishes the cheese can then be eaten very fresh or it can be salted and aged for more time in which case it's going to develop a stronger and saltier flavor today i'm going to serve queso fresco in a very simple way crumbled over fresh watermelon with a little bit of mint sometimes in the dead of summer eating a bunch of cheese doesn't sound like the best idea but a very fresh bright acidic cheese like queso fresco is a very refreshing and delicious summer dish you simply chunk off a little bit of the queso fresco and we're going to crumble it on top of the watermelon i'm going to dress my queso fresco salad with a bit of fresh mint simply by ripping the leaves and putting them on top and then all you need is a fork to dig in and enjoy this is feta a fresh cheese that was originally made in greece but is now made in many places across the world the thing that makes feta different from other fresh cheeses is the fact that it is packed and aged in a salt brine feta was one of the earliest cheeses made by humans and it was made in a climate that was warmer so packing the feta and aging it in salt brine meant that it could keep for a long period of time today i'm going to slice the feta with my chef's knife just into neat slices and then i'm going to plate it with the olives feta and olives are also a great combination because they're from the same part of the world and so these two foods have evolved over time and complement each other in a beautiful way crumble the feta and then finally we will drizzle with a little olive oil this type of dish is a perfect thing to bring to a picnic or also as an appetizer to start off dinner this is labna labnut is a very dense thick and creamy middle eastern style cheese that effectively blurs the line between yogurt and cheese it is very bright tart tangy almost lemony but because you start with whole milk it is irresistibly creamy lavender can be served with a variety of fresh herbs or dried herbs and i've decided today to serve it with a little bit of zatar which is a wonderful middle eastern spice blend that really complements that creamy tangy quality of the cheese gently sprinkle it on top and then drizzle with olive oil this is farmer cheese typically a very fresh white cheese that is not pressed or aged it has a very fluffy texture and a very creamy but subtle flavor so it's a great blank canvas for a wide range of flavors today we're going to serve it with a little bit of dill and salt and pepper and essentially create our own little party dip i'm going to start by chopping up this fresh dill put a little bit of the dill on the top as well as a little bit of sea salt and then some crushed black pepper to finish it off and mix the herbs in you can enjoy the farmer cheese all on its own or with a crispy bread like pretzels crackers or a toasted baguette this is mascarpone pronounced mascarpone in italian this is a double or triple creme cheese that originated in the lombardy region of italy the terms double cream and triple cream and cheese refer to the overall percentage of butter fat in the cheese a double cream cheese has anywhere from 60 to 74 butter fat and a triple cream cheese has 75 butter fat or more meaning these cheeses are luscious and creamy and silky and decadent so today i'm going to top the muscarpone with assorted fresh berries raspberries blackberries and blueberries and crumble some of the thyme on top and we're going to dip in some crusty flatbread yum this is halloumi traditional halloumi is a semi-firm fresh cheese that's made from a blend of goat and sheep's milk and sometimes cow's milk from the island of cyprus in order to be called halloumi the cheese has to come from cyprus and being made according to these traditions the thing that makes halloumi distinctive and different from other fresh cheeses is the fact that it has a very low acidity and high melting point so you can fry it or grill it and it won't lose its shape or texture here i have some grilled halloumi so you can see the difference between what the fresh uncooked halloumi looks like and the grilled halloumi you'll see that it browns and caramelizes in a beautiful way and it oozes a little bit but it definitely doesn't run and it holds its shape you're going to taste the milky and sweet flavors associated with fresh cheeses but because the cheese really browns and caramelizes in the pan you're also going to get some of those more sweet caramely and roasty toasty notes and squeeze a little lemon juice on top drizzle it with a touch of olive oil and if it needs a little bit more salt or a little bit more of a punch you can drizzle some fresh sea salt and black pepper on top as well this is cotija cotija takes its name from the town of kotiha which is located in the michoacan province of mexico cotija is a very salty fresh cheese that's used to enhance flavor in many different dishes we're going to serve the cotija crumbled over corn with a little bit of cilantro as kind of a nod to a lotte which is a very traditional mexican dish you literally can just break off the cotija and crumble it over top of the corn and then we are going to just simply tear the cilantro leaves as a garnish on top there are thousands of different kinds of cheese i wasn't able to show you every kind of cheese but the information that i presented will allow you to share and enjoy an incredibly wide variety of cheese with your friends and family,42:03

d_k0f8VGxtw,Car Throttle,Automobile,What Your Exhaust Smoke Is Trying To Tell You,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_k0f8VGxtw,5 years ago,3.2M views,Automobile,what your exhaust smoke is trying to tell you we've all been there you catch a glimpse of smoke circling in your rear-view mirror and you instantly panic but not all exhaust smoke is bad so let's take a look at the combinations of visible emissions from your exhaust and what they mean black smoke the darker smoke emitted from the exhaust is generally nothing to worry about and is linked with the balance of combustion controlled by the ECU a darker visible exhaust gas is due to an overly rich fuel mixture created when the air fuel ratio descends below the optimum ratio the spark @ ignition can only combust a certain amount of fuel in a cycle so unburned fuel is pushed out into the exhaust system and it's combusted downstream of its intended combustion chamber these conditions can be caused by a leaking fuel injector a blocked fuel return pipe a broken oxygen or air flow sensor or a fuel pressure regulator stuck closed a dirty air filter will also prohibit clean air from making it through to the combustion chamber not only will this constrict the volume of air entering the cylinders it will also make for less efficient combustion blue smoke blue looking smoke can be found in cars that have unwanted oil mixing with the air fuel mixture this means there's a contaminant with the cylinders and it's combusting along with the air and fuel this cross-contamination is caused by engine where to the cylinders Pistons and valves along with failed seals a damaged valve stem seal or guide will also allow oil to make its way down from the valve train above the cylinder head while a damaged piston ring will allow oil from the crankcase to squeeze its way upwards and into the cylinders the differing pressures within the combustion chamber throughout the engine cycle will lead to oil being sucked through any leaks in the same way that the air fuel mixture is sucked in via the opening of the inlet valve this can lead to lack of compression within the cylinders and increased pressure within the crankcase resulting in decreased power blue smoke can be common in modified and turbocharged cars by turning up the power outputs in an engine more stresses apply to each component increasing where and the possibility of oil leaks turbochargers themselves can also fail allowing the oil use to lubricate the turbine to spill from bad seals into the cylinders along with the compressed air adding to the air fuel mixture contamination white smoke white looking smoke probably isn't smoke at all but steam and this can potentially be nothing bad or you could be a mile or two away from an engine replacement you may notice that from a cold start white smoke will emanate from the exhaust tips this is nothing to worry about and is created by vapor from combustion if your car is fully warmed up the ambient temperature is reasonable and if your car is still producing steam however you could be looking at head gasket failure or even a cracked cylinder head or block from overheating the head gasket is designed to keep the oil and coolant systems apart along with cementing the cylinder head and combustion chambers together a split in the gasket will send liquids into places they shouldn't be and if a head gasket fails in a particular area coolant will enter the cylinders the engine will then try to compress and combust water leading to potentially catastrophic engine damage and also steam pouring out of the exhaust the size of the leak will dictate how much steam is produced but often when a head gasket fails you won't be able to see out of the back window due to your car suddenly morphing into an actual steam engine if that's the case then pull over as quickly as you can and pray to the car gods so there you have it the differences between engine smoke collars and what they're trying to tell you happy smoke diagnosing make sure you hit the bell icon at the bottom of this video to be notified whenever we release a new video the BMW m2 and we're gonna teach you the differences and how to initiate them [Applause] [Music],3:42

forever do you guys want some help I feel like you wouldn't be too mad if I hired a couple additional workers right what do you think do you think like 50 you can get the work done better only one way to find out here comes the bus with our new people oh my god there they are yes see that's much better get that work done lickety-split oh my god and then when they're done they just go back to their home over here that's so weird they're barely moving okay well now I have to know is there a limit to how many people I can hire you think it'll really let me hire a thousand people yes yes it is and they just keep flowing out of that buzz it's like the employee bus sprung a leak and they're just pouring out now Oh God it feels like a living entity now doesn't it everything's just kind of moving well it'd be a logical to stop at a thousand now let's see how the game appreciates ten thousand so far so good but it's only 12:40 p.m. whoa what's happening here oh I see we have a second shipment also look at this poor bus sandwiched in the middle it's been forty minutes in game now and these buses are still unloading oh my god a third bus showed up they've been unloading for an hour now oh they're finally done what a relief the buses can finally leave okay well there you go our construction workers ready to work okay I know it's excessive but now we need to go for broke and that's not to hire just a hundred thousand people let's go for a million hiring those additional nine hundred ninety thousand workers only gonna cost him your 1.9 billion come on and join the workforce oh boy here comes the first of what I'm sure is gonna be many buses mark the time everybody it's 3:10 p.m. in-game next bus has arrived and no one seems to be coming out of this one wait a minute people are still coming out of these buses we just can't see them welp let's just wait this out and see what happens oh my god what is going on I think everyone's starting to merge with everyone else I don't know what else to call this I do want to point out more phantom people are still coming three hours later we're at the point now where buses are just backed all the way up to the edge of the map I can also hover over these people and eventually it'll show me that in that little space there's 2700 people right there what the game crashed okay let's split the difference go with the modest 25,000 people that seems like a more manageable amount right whoa wait what's happening are you guys okay are you coming down with a virus what is this hang on let's put some of these people to work just so we can see what happens oh my god what is this nightmare that's unfolding this is absolutely terrifying the hood when they're done with construction they just kind of contract back into that space well just for fun let's see how long it takes them to do this it's weird it's almost like trying to drive 25 thousand people around the map it's having some issues I feel like I died and went to art hell we've got this bizarre experimental style playing out at a beautiful point oh oh oh one frames per second all overshadowed by the dulcet tones of neverending jackhammers you know I don't think this is ever gonna end but I will say this still more pleasant than a normal Airport god I'm trying to get to the main menu in the jackhammer sound it's just getting sad ok back to sanity I know it's gonna be hard but we're gonna stick with just our trusty 10000 all I really want is for them to maintain their human form so good job with that so far anyway back to my airport is our lovely tiny little space as a reminder we need some ticketing security and baggage claim ticketing we're gonna make this one tiny spot right there baggage claim is gonna be this tiny spot right here and the games already yelling at me oh it's because it's isolated and unreachable don't worry we'll get there and security we're gonna have take up all of this space oh wow we failed all kinds of stuff metal detector bag scanner ID checkstand oh boy this is gonna be a tight fit isn't it ok let's make it slightly bigger hey construction crews can I have your oh ok thanks it did it so fast the shadow of the building is still there ok so let's make it a little bit bigger 14 by 14 let's say and we'll put ticketing right here baggage claim is gonna be one tiny square in the corner garbage goes away and now garbage 2 lives right here let's make sure to put a nice big door on the front you know what let's move you guys inside let's make deliveries this little square in the middle here oh god here they come oh why is it so organic and weird like that you know this right here is scarier than any horror game ok and we'll put security right here so ID check stand we're gonna put right here up against the workers the metal detector and we take this thing and like face it into the oh yeah so you have to walk into these people to use it and our bag scanner which we'll go ahead and put right there that organisation doesn't even make sense I like it now back over here to ticketing let's go ahead and put down a ticketing desk even though we've got the space for more than one what's the hurry you all like waiting in line don't you and we've also got a staff up thankfully the game tells me exactly what I need three security guards one single staff member I just love the disparity here one staff member $20 an hour three security guards hundred and twenty an hour 10,000 workmen 250,000 dollars an hour but at least everyone comes to work happy and faceless so once people are done its security where they have to walk into construction workers while their bags go into a wall we'll go ahead and door right here he's gonna take you to our beautiful gate how do I build the gate anyway gate oh there it is we'll start with a small one which we'll go ahead and put right yeah right there looks good let's see what do we need to build this out requires a gate agent desk okay we'll take that we're gonna put it right over here facing against the wall there we go our faceless employee is now working diligently with her back to the door and lastly we need to add the runway like how was the runway gets longer it shows all the planes that can partake now finally the b73 w in my airport okay looks good let's see what else it needs fryers at least one taxiway connected on both ends and I just take the taxiway and just put like one little square on each end will it consider that a done deal as a matter of fact yes that was enough for it in the eyes of the game this is a fully functional runway yeah we're getting closer I can feel it what does this thing need now two adjacent taxiways and a taxiway path to at least one runway just have this runway kind of kind of take the scenic route before heading on over to the runway these workers by the way I've got to be just the fittest people of all time just look at all the running they do okay there we go no more alert arrows our very complete looking airport is ready for prime time next thing we got to do is line up some flights over here we need to make deals with all these airlines to take their available flights and schedule them down below strangely I'm only seeing morning and afternoon flights apparently to get the rest we need to upgrade our runway to have safety lights or whatever well you don't have to tell me twice give me those lights wait a minute are they sending just one person to work on this well alright looks like they've got it under control okay much better look at all those flights we can schedule and we're gonna schedule as many of these as we can I like how there's all this stuff up here like how happy the airline is with us and as you can see they have absolutely no trust in us don't worry Airlines you'll come to trust me you're about to accept every flight from this airline I sure AM jeez that one plane needs two hours i shorten that a little bit okay I guess 90 minutes is the best we guess so long as we're packing in these flights oh my God look at this one look how many they have I'll take them all look at all those amazing flights I still need to schedule there's so many they just burst off the page okay here we go our modest little gate as a completely full schedule well look here come our first people right now now everybody wait your turn in line or what the hell are you doing wait for this invincible woman then it's your turn okay here she goes over to check her ID and straight through into the metal detector into the group of people what a streamlined process this is and she gets over here and like uh can I sit down or something and of course the answer is no be like that guy stare directly at the wall I mean honestly does this feel that different than a normal airport experience also good god these people are here for their 1:30 a.m. flight at 11:15 I mean it is my Airport so I guess that's actually just good planning well look who's here if it isn't flight 195 here for its 12 a.m. scheduled arrival that's right take your sweet time the later the better come on big guy here you go and there it is and here comes all the lovely people together as one fleeing the aircraft okay buddy I know you're excited to do baggage claim but maybe get off the whoa whoa what are these people one with their vehicles now Oh another pooping baggage I get it all in that one tiny corner where I told them to put them and what the hell is happening up here calm down everybody or this guy's gonna run you over why are you taking this route why are you insisting on running everybody over not that I mind okay meanwhile everyone's finally getting on the aircraft and with everyone on board the plane heads off - whoa whoa whoa that is one boy in aircraft he's like I need to get out of here and never come back I don't feel like they're going fast enough what is happening here wait wait whoa whoa whoa whoa what was that technique why did they teach you then flight school you know I don't even know how to feel about that okay you know what I don't like that that flight arrived on time and left on time so we're gonna dismantle this taxiway build something with a little more pizzazz I mean I assume the game will let me do this right oh and look we got a plane already going through it can you imagine being on this plane having to endear every single one of these turns over and over again for the rest of your days you know it turns out it doesn't matter how late they are people still get on the plane you would also think that some of these pilots especially with their advanced piloting techniques we'd be going down this and be like yeah this is essentially the runway I'll just take off from this but no instead they spend a half hour zigzagging in plane purgatory so here's all the things that the plane is supposed to and arrives deplane unload baggage load baggage yep the new flight crew on and then board people but I discovered a fun new option for stoop archers so let's see what happens when we do this case of the plane taxis into the gate as normal does indeed let all the people disembark and that's apparently all it does all these people over here like excuse me and over here they're like oh yeah there it goes 0% boarded well now I'm just gonna do this for every plane I told this plane to just take off at this point in the arrival process and then once it finally arrives it's like everybody off ok bye then it heads off to the runway for a smooth standard takeoff this is how I imagined it sounding on the inside okay so as funny as this whole process is to watch people never ever be able to get on their flight I can't help but wonder if there's a way we can get more people to miss their flights more often while this whole process is going on other planes actually can't land on the runway one plane takes off and the moment it's clear another plane lands so how do we get two planes up in this what if we add some additional little taxiways like right here and right there just a couple little dodging points yes that's the spirit be fearless no way can that airplane liquify you in seconds oh my god it's happening another plane has landed at the same time how are they going to navigate this situation oh they just wait politely what beautiful plane ballet that was but still because we have the one gate and only so many flights I think we're still gonna see a lot of empty runway so let's add another gate there we go a horrible little concrete hallway that takes you to the gate oh wait I need room for one of these desks or do I like how the construction person just walks up like hey it's not my job to care you want it I build it that's the spirit smashed between your desk and a wall forever well no sense in giving you all this space now that I know we can have these desks in the most uncomfortable places okay great now we've got two gates with full schedules so this is getting slightly more busy but not by much I think we'll we need our more gates and not just these small ones either let's jump straight to the excel gate so put one there and here and here and there finally my crews have something to do now these ones are a little bit different they require a door to a terminal on the second floor second floor huh hope you people like stairs okay there you go what does our second floor look like anyway ah perfect that's what I like to see can I extend this without building on the first floor damn it requires foundation on the floor below so be it I'm happy to put my claustrophobic little corridors on the floor below and now we'll just build them up here okay great and I want to believe because this is all in one big hallway that we can just mash all five desks in a row here scheduling-wise I tried to take all available flights and kind of clump them together let's see how it goes that's strangely pretty isn't it probably a little stressful for the pilots but that sounds like a damn problem int oh no it's happening again Oh God okay let's see I think we can logically work this out if we head down here we can see in our pickup area there appears to be some people waiting for pickup not just people by the way some very frustrated people that really need to use the bathroom but it looks like when a bus arrives 75 people at a time can get on board I'm thinking all the people that are walking over to get picked up is far exceeding that number and so this weird kaleidoscope of people is just growing all the time it's almost like there are some kinks in my chain of operations so I surmise if we lower the population then the horror show should be contained it turns out we have a button down here for research which has a bunch of things we can unlock I bet there's something in here that can help us out oh and I found it upgraded buses bus has become double deckers for double the capacity well shiver me timbers let's do it but we can't build it yet because apparently first we need to hire a CEO oh and give them an office okay the first step to making an office we got to find a place to put it I'm thinking right here okay oh god what now requires enclosed space office chair office desk damn it's a can't put walls out here it's too close to the taxiway okay let's see if we can find somewhere else oh I have an idea how about right here in this isolated little hallway we'll just slap a door right here put down a nice office chair have it face the wall and surely we can get this desk to fit yep there we go and there it is the perfect office it's got writing by is like hell of an office sir almost than my car legs speaking of what the hell is happening here is this how they get these things up and down the stairs they just like Tony Hawk it right up the stairs is that what's happening I mean I get it you got to get to that gate somehow right okay where was I all right hiring a CEO oh I'm glad they all look like evil bankers the new administrators traveling to work they're probably so excited to have a new office to work in you know I've been quietly waiting for the CEO to show up so I could give them like a proper greeting but I haven't seen them and this view isn't helping me at all all I've got is has office yes good enough for me let's upgrade some buses while we wait for the research to complete hate to say my lovely construction crew but we're gonna have to let some of you go just for now we're gonna cut back down to 5,000 I like how in any other real situation laying up 5,000 people would be like catastrophic but overhear my fired employees have managed to turn it into interpretive dance there we go hundred and fifty capacity I just have to pray that overtime these buses can pick up everybody while that's going on I saw one more thing I think we can really use land expansion allows the purchase of additional map parcels judging by how our airport currently is using the entire play space I think that's a great idea oh yeah that's the good stuff oh wow it opens up this whole thing yes please so it's so powerful it has to reload the game and look the people are cured the waking nightmare is over for now I also noticed the CEO Oh is finally in her office and of course she's totally despondent I get it though I'd be shocked too if my office were this nice okay so before we go land buying crazy I want to make sure we've got our runway situation squared away I think this extra land is gonna be mostly useful for more gates but for that to be handy we need to finish filling this schedule and to fill the schedule we need more flight contracts and to get more flight contracts we need all of these airlines to like us a little bit more than they do like spark jet thirty-six percent rating why don't you love us a lot of this is looking pretty abysmal thirty-six percent trust communication thirty-five percent so I think we can make a lot of this better by giving them a rep to do so we have to buy sales reps I mean hire them and here they all are just hanging out in the drop-off area as all high-powered business people do well let's get you all assigned you lucky airline you get sales rep number one two nine five three Oh remember the name and just like that our ratings have improved oh yeah look at all these flights available to us now give me all these some of these ratings are still pretty low though so I think I'm gonna try and work on that passenger satisfaction I'm pretty sure we've got room to grow there well with all these people waiting and my one tile wide baggage claim thanks for dropping off those bags car centaur so according to the game passenger satisfaction is connected to how miserable your customers are as you can see if you mouse over pretty much anybody on the better end they're only a hundred percent frustrated now on the higher end we can see things getting steadily worse okay actually you know what before we try to make this better I want to see if we can make it worse is it possible to get all these meters to 100% bad well we're never gonna find out if people keep leaving so just for now we're gonna put a wall in front of the entrance and all of you that weren't smart enough to flee at the last minute you're the testbed you know I couldn't help but notice that everyone's just congregating to security now like literally every passenger stuck in the airport but unlike these pillars of calmness these people won't stop moving wait a minute are you telling me they'll just go wherever the security boundaries are well gotta test this so if we put a second security box over here it doesn't look like anyone moves but if I erase this first one oh my god I can tell them what to do are you kidding me oh my god we have to test this further well there's a door right here does that mean if I go all the way over here can I make him go to like the middle of the airport everybody let's move huh well some people are going up to the door but it looks like most of them are just creepily spreading out this looks so weird it's like a coat closet trying to find its way up the stairs also I like how they kind of bounce when they get up to the top of the stairs they do like a jaunty little jump and then they skip away okay anyway let's see if we can figure out how to get them to go outside here what if I just carve a hole for you no what's it gonna take huh maybe this is too far away maybe they need it a little closer to home let's try this really still nothing what if I build like a little room out here Oh yep there we go most people are coming okay now let's close everybody in this lady's like oh I wanted to be trapped with thousands of people and now let's remove the security zone now let's get rid of this whole thing yeah there we go be free my friends oh god where exactly are they going wait a minute what do you people know that I don't know oh you little cheaters you found a way back inside okay let's gather you all up again everybody back to where it's started this time around we're gonna be smarter get rid of these doors okay that's better to my knowledge there's no way back in here the front door is locked all the rest of these gates are on the second floor where they can't reach them and they can't get out to the street because there's a fence going the entire length of the airport okay let's try this again I have a new idea that I think is gonna work out we're gonna try this thing again but this time we're gonna turn it into a room unfortunately at the moment we can't put any buildings down here because they're too close to the taxiway so temporarily we're just gonna dig this up okay better and now we can put a room around this moment of truth let's see if this works sink or swim have fun oh my god I think it's working like how most people are polite about staying off the runway but not everyone look I don't want to tell you how to live but that's probably not the best place to contemplate life yep looks like it works most of the people are filtering into this tiny little room now that I managed to sucker these people into being in the middle of an airport let's go ahead and literally get rid of their security blanket oh yes there they go expand my pretties oh good the game just lets me put the taxiway back it doesn't care that there's people in the way this is just amazing these people don't have a care in the world well now that they're out there and wandering around can I just reopen the airport like it's business as usual I think the answer is yes oh my god and planes are landing again oh god how is this gonna go Oh God everything about this is fantastic this airplanes like own I bet these bigger jets just can't even see them either way this is definitely more my kind of airport how many people do you think we can get out here [Music] turns out a lot like a whole hell of a lot it's hard to calculate for sure but I think there's about 10,000 people on this runway now in between the people and the airplanes just no one cares about anything anymore as you can see we also streamline the runway a little bit I wanted to make sure there was plenty of open thoroughfares so all these planes could fulfill their bloodlust and it really feels like we're maintaining that circle of life as mentioned we were trying to make a more people-friendly Airport so let's give you the Grand Tour of our new terminal starting outside everything's pretty much the same people get off buses to head into the airport while all these business people just stand around and over here on the terminal we've kind of revamped a few things baggage claim is now in the dead center of the room I like to call this bag roulette because there's no way you're gonna find your bag so just take anything you want we also expanded and now there's more than one ticket counter with such a huge influx of people I wanted to make sure that everyone could be squared away speaking of people when being squared away these are windows back here which behind them holds a little surprise a whole bunch of people trapped in on display seeing as how you can see them from the drop-off area you would think this would serve as a warning sign but hey when you're late for your flight nothing's gonna stop you something perplexing to me is if you highlight any of these people we've succeeded in making them very unhappy except they're really not frustrated and they're not thirsty that raises all kinds of questions that I'm just gonna leave to your imagination I also went ahead and created some restrooms at this time it's really the perfect restroom one toilet no barriers and hundreds of people actively watching you I realize these things look like soap dispensers or something but they're actually PA speakers the only ones in my entire airport so that way when people are in there doing their business I can just pop on and be like everybody saw dude wait it's just something that happens considering their faces are like completely white it almost feels like when they're done peeing they just take off their pants to reveal their beautifully tanned legs I also read it security to handle more people it's every bit as messy as it was before oh yeah I'm sure these agents are real comfortable but with people literally shoving into them while they try and work and once you're through this nightmare there's only one thing left between you and the gay moving walkways a lot of moving walkways pretty much you need to start by going all the way up to the top of my airport where you're gonna hop on board for a ride you're not allowed to get off ever each one of these things takes 20 minutes to get through and there are six total that you need to go through because they're literally equal in length to the runway and once you're done riding for two whole hours time to head upstairs where it should come as no surprise that your plane left without you a really really long time ago that's okay though the journey back isn't that bad just gotta wait in line to go up to the third floor just follow where everyone else is going and you'll be fine after all you're all in this together and by this of course I mean amazed I love that even the employees have to go through it too and once you're done with this nonsense which takes about two and a half hours to get through then you just need to wait line for about 20 minutes and then you're finally free to leave the airport resume ibly an empty husk of the person you used to be wait now I take it back I think you're irreversibly changed forever I hope you're ready to enjoy life now as an isosceles triangle well I think that's about as much damage as we're gonna do I hope you had fun I know I did I gave this game 1 out of 1 realities being torn asunder and I'll see you next time",23:56
tw6vPc6j1V8,Let's Game It Out,VideoGames,I Shoplifted My Way to Another Million Dollars in Hydroneer,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6vPc6j1V8,,11M views,VideoGames,hey there it's josh welcome back to let's game it out we're playing hydroneer today my favorite game we were supposed to go panhandling for gold and minerals to make a whole bunch of money and in my case trying to get rich doing all the things the game doesn't want me to do let me catch up on what i've done before first we visited the shop and trashed it then we went over to the river and did some fishing and trashed it then realized we could sell all that fish for a bunch of money and then we actually did some panhandling and found some gold melted some stuff down and then we went to the big city where you can buy all kinds of other fun things and that's when we found a way to steal stuff like these really expensive thrones which you can steal put in your truck drive them over to this thing melt them down and then sell these crushed metal cubes for tons of money and that's how you end your playthrough with a money bin like your scrooge mcduck but that was last time we're starting fresh all over again there's been a lot of patches since the last time i played so we're gonna see if there's a new fun way to make our millions but just a quick primer here's how the game works you got a little bucket a big bucket and a brush oh and you've also got this shovel here's pretty much what you do take all this crap put it in a central area grab your shovel dig some dirt shove it in your bucket keep doing this till the bucket is full despite it being on its side take that bucket dump it in the bigger bucket head over to the river get you some water which is conveniently containing its water within the water in the bucket like that drop the water in the bucket grab your brush and do a little scrubby scrub ah fresh minerals looks like some iron in gold and do this over and over and scrub your problems away and before you know it we got all kinds of fun minerals which we can take and sell for money which is not this place by the way this is where we buy some tools and equipment we'll get to that later for now instead we're gonna head up this hill which is where the jeweler is also known as my personal pawn shop hello there unsupervised table i've brought some goods for you how much can i get for them 365 huh what a coincidence that's how many days in a year i don't want to spend making money the intended way now let's see what we can do with that coinage as mentioned before over here we can buy tools and equipment let's just leave this bucket outside for now and let's take a quick gander what our 350 or so coins will get us well based on the price of this grinding wheel i'm gonna go with more than a little and less than a lot not everything's that expensive though some things are cheap like these pans either way it certainly adds up 52 here for a fishing pole light post for 160. oh my goodness this mining helmet's 361 and this world map is 45 i'd rather just be lost forever thank you anyway the point being is we're gonna obviously need more money because if we take these things put it on the buying platform like let's say we wanted to buy all this stuff starts to add up fast doesn't it 1203. i don't have that kind of money in my magic bucket and i definitely don't want to mine for it in a game that's about mining this didn't work last time but maybe i can just walk off without paying nope it just disappears out of your hands let's just try this one more time a different direction okay still doesn't work the game does have like a nice way to help you place things though let's see what if i like bring it outside of the area and then just drop it okay it's technically out of bounds now does that mean you're free now i'm gonna go with no because i can't actually interact with it in any way now so can i get things outside the shop yes can i use them once they're out here no can i make a huge mess always so i guess just like before i'm gonna settle for that this is my medieval version of a yelp review one out of five stars wasn't allowed to steal so i trashed the place instead as an aside i think i found my favorite new asmr sound are you ready okay well i feel better now i didn't get something for free but i did make something worse than i found it and that's really half the battle if you think about it so believe it or not i actually have a plan to make money but before i show you that we need a backup plan in case it's too much work last time we made some money simply by fishing in the river and selling the fish later so let's struggle through this mess and find a fishing rod come with me okay let's take this thing out and do some fishing last time we did some fishing kind of around this area let's see if this holds true if we go down river so let's see huh wait for it wait for it oh yeah there we go oh there it goes back under the water fishy are you okay down there fishy huh no the fish is very much not okay well come with me fish let's see how much you sell for at the jeweler here have a fish so obviously eight coins isn't really a lot which is why we're gonna do just a little more fishing there we go that's more like it in fact i think we got all of them all the fish they're right here in these weird fish columns okay now that we've got the trust fund secured the fish trust fund the front let me show you how i'm gonna make actual money now you may notice everything is cleaned up that's because when you restart the game everything you didn't pay for disappears that is except one item this water pipe valve i don't know why but if you put one down return to the main menu load your game back up the pipe is still here and more than that now the game thinks i own it which i guess technically means i do and i can pick it up put it down and do anything i want with it and i really did try this on everything else in the shop but after a restart it really is the only thing that's still here so i guess that means i choose you pipe a chew for shoplifting it's a little complicated though i'm not sure how to do this efficiently because normally i would use this truck here because commonly i can just pick stuff up walk it right on over here to the back and just leave it in here and while normally this would work pretty well let me show you something that happens here let's put the truck in position like we were gonna do a good old-fashioned robbery ideally it'd be great to get this pipe into the back of that truck and do it without having to spawn it here and then restart the game to make it whole because if i don't restart the game and i try to walk it out of here it just disappears like normal and even though i could pick this thing up lock it to the boundary line and then use the placement tool to drop it somewhere out here i still can't pick it up or do anything with it until i restart the game what i would like to do is take one of these things and immediately put it on the back of the truck but if i do that without paying for it or restarting the moment it hits the truck bed it disappears and the reason we want it on the truck bed which i'll explain with one of these ones that's already been made whole is the jeweler won't buy him instead we have to take him somewhere else which i'll show you after a brief little jaunt which is if we run down this pathway over this amazing bridge and then just keep on running all the way to the town of bridgeport we have to use something here called the scrap yard i used this last time to make my millions so we're gonna do it again if i put something down on this little grating right here and then i head on over to this button i can incinerate it into a nice little cube and then i can take that cube and run that over to the local jeweler and sell each pipe for 11 whole coins so if we want to make a lot of money we're gonna need a lot of pipes there are a bunch of other stores here by the way stuff like housing or even more tools and equipment and other stuff like a bunch of conveyor belts and of course my favorite glorious furniture sadly i've tried this trick on every other store to see if it works but when you restart the game it all goes away it just means those inexpensive pipes are what we're stuck with but i think i've come across an item that's to make life easier on us which is this palette here drop items on top to lock to palette used for moving or purchasing multiple items easily now the problem is it's 450 coins luckily i think we know a bank that's willing to give us a loan a riverbank that is so let's see how can i whoa did you see that i just touched the magic bucket to the column of fish and now they're in my bucket oh my god this is amazing my bucket runneth over 6668 coins don't mind if i do okay this should be enough capital to get us started we're gonna buy a couple of these pallets just gonna put a couple on the buying plat you're fine let's start with just three okay and let's bring the pallets back over here and see if we can do something fun let's see we'll just put one right here just as a test let's see if we can put a bunch of these on if i pick this up do they stay on it great if i carry this over here and put it in the truck does it stay greater and then if i restart the game to make them corporeal are they there when i get back absolutely yes well let's load up these pallets and just see how many can stick to it well i stacked a couple on there let's see how this works well now that i've picked it up it's kind of hard to tell what's going on so let's put it down again and see how we did yep yeah flip on your side that's perfect you know seems pretty good i'm not really sure how those in the back are connected though but they are so i'm not gonna question it okay well with my really limited vision let's see if we can get this in the truck okay i think this might do it i honestly can't even tell if it's in the truck but hey let's get in and find out you know i can't quite put my finger on it but i feel like something might be a miss okay let's try that again and in you go okay there we go we just had to position it better let's load another palette okay let's see how are we gonna get this onto the back of there first we'll pick it up with our superhuman strength and use our exceptional vision to walk over to the truck bed wait can i just like lump this inside it okay i loaded the other one in and uh yeah everything's fine the game did not turn into a horror movie this is definitely not what my sleep paralysis demon looks like okay you know what maybe we just need to tame it a little bit all right let's just get in yeah see look we just have to tame it like a wild horse and then it'll calm down or it could throw me off and i don't really think it's coming down no i think we're just going to leave that guy up there it is still up there right yep it sure is just twitching away and i think we're maybe going to pick up a new vehicle let's see we could get another of the same truck or how about the newest model let's do that i don't even know what the difference is but who cares okay let's try this again what if i stack these ahead of time can i just mash one palette into another uh i do believe it did i believe both pallets are now one what about a third do we think we can shove this in and you go oh don't be that way come back oh i see did it have to return to its home planet well i don't think that's coming back okay be nice this time no more flying off into space okay see that's much better that's the kind of co-existing i want to see okay so i think i stacked as many pipes is gonna fit in this thing i have absolutely no idea how many things are shoved to this pallet in here it's enough that the frame rate is definitely suffering oh how it's suffering so let's slowly but surely make our way to the scrap yard and let's see how much our bounty is worth okay here goes nothing ah i burned the bad frame right away hello single magical cube let's take you to the local jeweler and see how much you're worth tell me something exciting a cool 3547 let's see to become a millionaire we only need about 280 more of these well better get started oh hey i didn't see you there me oh i'm just holding a cube i was gonna put it on my cube wall here let's see let's just find a place for it i don't know somewhere in the back i guess yeah just kind of shove it in there whatever and with that cube we did it i don't know how many trips that took or how many pipes are in there but who cares we're a millionaire again as you can imagine i had a lot of time to think while i did all that shoplifting and also staring up at our beautiful pipe god that has finally managed to calm down but thankfully is ever present at all times so i'm gonna start buying some stuff i'll sort of explain the process as i go so this little device got added to the game recently the compressor compresses uncut regular or compressed gems how many gems do you think i think there's only one way to find out let's see if there's any limit to how many gems we can compress of course that means we have to dig them up so let's buy some of these ram drills because we can use them on top level dirt opposed to these goliath drills which we have to dig down and do a little bit more work for do i look like someone who's ready to waste time so let's go ahead and just back up the truck throw all this crap into the back and we can't forget all kinds of pipes because everything in this game is powered by water and we're gonna make one last pit stop at this little store over here that has conveyor belts because who doesn't love those and now that we're all suited up let's head on over to the dig site also known as a big empty dirt lot which of course the game makes us pay for not like this price matters you insult me game be gone with the sign okay let's get started first thing that we're gonna need to do is establish a water source which is gonna be this little dock right over here for that we're gonna need our pipes which we're gonna put down nice and delicately first thing we do is take a pipe shove it right into the ground which endlessly pulls water and makes this horrible horrible noise and remember this lovely pipe that we kept stealing we're gonna use that to shut it up thank god and from there we're just gonna kind of build out the pipe system but before we get too involved in that looks like it's gonna start to get dark soon which reminds me i forgot to pick up a bed so let's run all the way back to town to buy one hello furniture shop one fancy bed please and now let's run this nice child bed all the way to the job site and i mean i could place it like right here or i could place it down here completely submerged in dirt and water ah restful sleep not being able to breathe my favorite i feel so rested so for starters we're just gonna keep on with our pipe system until we can get it all the way over to the dirt there we go looking good so now that we've run the water pipe let's get one of our drills okay let's see just like that perfect and the way this works is if we turn it on it digs up dirt for us now ideally what we want to do is get as much dirt as we can and we could process this by hand but obviously we'd want to automate this a little bit and we're going to split off the water so we can power this thing this is our harvester break small chunks of dirt into resources essentially the way it works is right on top here's like a grindy thing so if i just drop the rock on it out comes minerals and of the minerals that eventually pop out we eventually have things like this uncut emeralds so these are the kinds of things we're looking for who eventually shove into this thing to compress for all eternity but this is just a demonstration to show how it works i'm not gonna stand here and keep feeding this thing dirt over and over again that's where the conveyor belts come into play so let's move this thing for now we're not gonna need it and let's place a conveyor belt right here where the rocks are gonna come out let's add another one and another one and a couple of these leading up and another one leading across and this is where we'll put the harvester now in theory so dirk can go up here and fall in there in theory of course in truth you never know until you try so let's give this a shot and see if it works rock goes up ah that worked out great now what we really need is more rocks for this thing to pummel through this just isn't enough so let's go ahead and add some more ram drills one after another and another okay here we go let's see how this does with 10 of these well seems to be doing the trick everything's just dropping in one after the other i would say this is working out well oh you know what can we just take our magic doohickey here and just like put it right here oh yeah that's great i know it said it's only supposed to compress gems what do i care what goes in there [Music] uh-oh looks like we're getting a little full so let's go ahead and pull the lever and compress it down uh yeah wow that's a lot of sound for not a lot of change i can't honestly tell if it did anything what if i just keep pushing this thing over and over again that's generally how heavy machinery works right okay i think i broke the lever because it's not working anymore but oh hello what might you be composite emerald well seeing as how i have no idea what actually got compressed into here let's go see how much it sells for anyway let's see 60 60. get this garbage out of my face we can do better than that so i guess we're gonna have to optimize our process a little bit and to do that we're gonna pick up a fun other machine called a conveyor splitter splits off selected resources onto a new conveyor belt i like the way you think random piece of equipment okay let's see how we're going to integrate this tech into this cacophony i guess first we're going to need to move this out of the way ah well i'm not sure what to do about this but what the hell it's not hurting anyone we'll just force it to mine meld with this conveyor belt okay i think this is gonna work things are gonna spit out here they're gonna go into this machine oh let's set this to gem that could have been a faux pas and i believe what that means is the gems will pop out of the back here and everything else will come out of this chute into this hole i've made because who cares about those materials so uh i don't think the machine's working although looking at that conveyor belt i think this is the out shoot and not the in shoot okay so be it we'll turn this thing around backwards so that nobody's comfortable but it does appear to be working now i'm seeing normal minerals fall into my pit of despair and all the uncut gems are coming out of the back front thing okay hold on let's get this thing under the front okay and there we go rocks go in there minerals pop out there most of them go in here and the chosen few go in here now all we need to do is wait for this setup to run for a little while and we'll see what we get okay i've let this setup run for a little while really so far so good to my total shock everything is still working as intended our gem thingy is full of gems and i definitely misgauged how big i needed to make this hole so that's a big ol mess anyway it's time we tested this out so here we go ah well there you go three glorious giant gem things let's take these bad boys to town and see how they do don't forget to wish me good fortune sky car i have high hopes for this oh not bad 4 000 and the emerald is 41 and the ruby is the weak one of the litter but still a combined amount of 10 000 not too bad all that says to me is there's room to grow so hang on a second i'm gonna redo this thing see if we can get a little more production out of it [Music] okay so before we had these 10 and i feel like it was pretty effective so i'm very hopeful that 681 have good results too before i fire any of this stuff up let me give you the tour naturally everything starts over here pulling from the water and then the pipes run all the way here to this valve and then the water splits off to power the ram drills as well as these conveyor belts and rinse and repeat for a really long time once dirt pops out of these machines it'll go down this conveyor belt all the way to the end where it'll join up with a larger conveyor belt system where all the rocks will move from left to right up to these ramps at which time they'll go right over the edge into these waiting harvesters where the gems and minerals will be taken over here to this splitter and anything that's not a gem is going to get launched onto my new bed so i can sleep in wealth and the remaining gems will go back here and be dumped in this little compartment it couldn't be more simple except for the part where i haven't tested this so i have no idea what this is gonna do to the frame right i mean i've tested it with a few but not all 600 plus running at the same time so let's do this let's turn it on and see what happens oh my god first of all this is the worst noise ever and my ears are bleeding every time these things all pump in unison and on top of that i think the frame rate might be having a couple of issues but enough out of me how are the machines running well if the spotty sound coming in and out is any indicator things are working at peak efficiency that and in the distance you can see the rocks struggling to make their way over here okay let's go let's go see how the other side's doing if we can well look things might be going at like 0.0001 frames per second but at least the machine crapped minerals on my bed and i do believe that's a gem slowly eventually one day making its way to the promised land so i don't know how you couldn't call this a rousing success except for the part where the game is lagging so bad that i think i'm having an aneurysm just trying to slowly stumble my way back over to the valve i have the dumb idea that i can somehow salvage this without reloading quickly turn it off ah see that's much better let's go see what it looks like on the other side of this thing well i would say in the most technical sense this worked out really really well but in the practical sense i'm gonna say about 50 50. so let's see if we can't try something instead of turning the master valve back on i'm gonna close off this valve right here that once i tighten this thing it's only gonna power this line right here so hopefully that'll be a little bit more tolerable to the game okay and there go my eardrums okay this seems potentially a lot more pleasant maybe i like how i'm waiting for those little pieces to finally make their way over here just in the background i see like a couple of frames of some rocks just flying away so i'm gonna go ahead and say that this is still not effective let's go ahead and load back to before we tried any of that i got a new idea so i moved the valve from over here and bypassed all of this stuff instead so the only thing that gets water pressure is the very last one hoping this will be a little easier on the game and so far actually not that bad yeah this seems to be doing slightly better we certainly have a lot more minerals flowing than before that's for sure but most importantly my sleeping arrangements are perfect i'm not sure what i like more being constantly rained on by minerals or fits the absolutely deafening sound of all the collision happening but hey it looks like everything's technically working and what else could you ask for and the moment i said that the game delivered once again i decided to take a quick power nap despite the slowdown and you know what i learned when the game is running this poorly it just won't let you leave the bed like look you can just see the days passing by so i guess the game decided for us that this is where we're stopping so i hope you had fun i know i did i'll be here just waiting for my sleep paralysis demon to appear again and i'll see you next time,20:16
t36jHEyK9C8,Mythical Kitchen,Food,$315 In-N-Out Animal Style Burger and Fries | Fancy Fast Food | Mythical Kitchen,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t36jHEyK9C8,2 years ago,2.1M views,Food,"- I see it in his eyes that he hates me and that's fine, I don't
need to be loved by everyone, but I sure want to. (light music) Can I go ahead and go a double double animal style add chopped chilies? And then can I do a double hamburger animal style, protein style? - You know what, let's do
a little chopped chili. - Yeah chopped chili
- Yeah, little chopped chili never hurt no one! - And then I'm gonna do two animal fries, can we do fry light on one of those. - Yes, I love fry light. Do you have any In-N-Out hats - Yeah!
- That we can have? - Yeah, can we have two?
- Yeah! - Two?
- Thank you! We're big fans
- Okay (laughs). - Oh my God I'm so jealous of your bun. This is Christine,
attempting to be healthy. - In-N-Out, first thing, cheers. - Cheers
- Toasted bun, that's super key. Like you get that little
crunch underneath your pallet. Two patties on the double double, mustard fried, that means they
actually singe the mustard into the meat, two slices
of cheese, grilled onions, extra spread, pickles, I
go chopped chilis because In-N-Out is my childhood and I
take ordering very seriously. Oh, it takes me back! That takes me back! In-N-Out burgers are really fantastic, but they're not like super super special. It's the spread where
they beat everyone else. I just like to take it
and eat it like a gogurt. It's basically thousand island, no one exactly knows what's in it, obviously it's got pickles,
it's got mayonnaise and it's got ketchup in it. - Really?
- So we need to figure out a way to recreate this
but in a fancy version. - So we're essentially making mayonnaise. - That's gonna part of it, yeah. - How do you make mayonnaise? - So mayonnaise right, it's
an emulsification of oil and protein coming from eggs.
- Mhm - So we need to get eggs, we get oil, and we need to whisk that together, we're not getting normal
chicken eggs though, we're getting eggs from
a different animal. - A gator? - Uh no, we are actually going
to get a single ostrich egg. There's a farm called Quail Run, we're meetin' a farmer named Lou, got a bunch of ostriches. - If it's called Quail Run,
why do they have ostriches? - Above my pay grade, dude. - Sounds like a mystery. - Two plucky young teen
detectives like ourselves, could solve that mystery. - Right after we finish our
shift at In-N-Out, baby! (both laughing) (light music) - [Josh] How you doin,' I'm Josh! - Hey, I'm Lou, how are ya? - Great to meet ya!
- Nice to meet you Lou! - It's a pleasure! - Tell me about Quail Run and Ostrich Run, how long you been in the
ostrich farming game? - I got the first ostrich in 1996, been at it ever since. - All right, so we're
here for an ostrich egg. - Egg, okay
- Yeah - Our goal is to make
the fanciest In-N-Out animal style burger and fries possible which requires mayonnaise
- Okay. - So our plan is to take an ostrich egg and turn it into a
whole lot of mayonnaise. - Okay
- Have you ever cooked with ostrich eggs, I'd imagine you would? - Hey, I can't cook water. - My wife, we've cooked
with a lot of 'em, yeah. - So what makes the ostrich
egg like different to work with than a chicken egg? - Well first the size, they're
just a little bit larger. - It's gonna be a lot of mayonnaise. - Well average ostrich egg
is anywhere from 18 to 36 extra large chicken eggs,
number two they are 30% less cholesterol and fat so
they are higher lean prized by the pastry chefs, it
makes everything rise, makes everything fluffy. - So if we have to go in there
and steal an ostrich egg. - Oh we're gonna do that. - If it comes down to
it, hand to hand combat, full grown man, woman, verse an ostrich--
- Half child. - I'm gonna give you a
shovel, my suggestion is dig a whole quick and jump in it. They are highly highly territorial, they don't have much of a sense of humor. - I like to use my words
to get out of conflict, so I'll probably just bargain with 'em. - Tell ya what, he goes
after you, you talk to him, let me know how it works out. - I imagine it hasn't been successful. - Not too successful for this cow poke. (lively music) There they go! - Look at 'em open up
- Oh my gosh! - They're just cruisin'
- They got great form! - [Lou] Now this is Gomez and Mortisha - Oh my God!
- He's a beautiful young African black male.
- His features are different than the others!
- He's beautiful, isn't he? - I no longer think I
could take one in a fight - Oh my God
- Come here - I will say that
- Come here. - I wanna pet it, but
I don't wanna pet it. It's scary
- Come here, come here I know, come on. I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm not gonna hurt you
- I don't wanna do that. - Hi, yeah!
- Hi, I'm too short for them to reach me so I'm grateful. - Oh my God
- They are so-- - You want some fingers?
- Look at their big eyes. - They're so human in a way
- They're so beautiful! Look at his feathers, I can't get over it. - Be nice, you'll notice
that his shins ans his beak are red, this is indicative
of his hormonal level being elevate this is the very tail end of their breeding season
- Gotchya. Not cuffing season. - They're hormonally fueled
and driven like testosterone, so what does that sound like? Sounds like the male of the species. - Boys, it sounds like a frat boy! - I wanna party with an ostrich, dude. - Oh hi!
- I see in his eyes that he hates me and that's
fine, I don't need to be loved by everyone, but I sure want to. - [Lou] We're gonna go
get this one here now. - Okay, perfect.
- When we get the eggs here we have to be very careful because the roosters can be a handful. Okay, I'm gonna watch the
bird, I'm gonna watch the bird. - [Josh] Christine, be
confident with your movements. - They're hormonally fueled and driven. (dramatic music) Got it! - I got the egg! An it's giant, it feels
like it's a dinosaur egg. - Lou, thank you so much. - Hey, you're quite welcome. - This was the best thing, we have some cooking to do. - Thank you!
- Come back any time. - Okay Christine, we're
back in the kitchen, we gotta start cookin'
- Yeah - Our fancy, animal
style burgers and fries. - I still can't get over this egg. - I'm so excited to smash it. - We do need this to make
our fancy thousand island. So that's In-N-Out spread, this thing just rolls
around on the table, huh? They're called black
krim heirloom tomatoes, they're a little bit fancier
than normal tomatoes, that's just gonna go on our burger. - Okay
- Also on the burger, we have cabot cloth-bound cheddar, we are going to infuse it with
dom perignon 2008 reserved champagne
- Always, yeah. - And then for the burgers
we're taking this 120 day aged tomahawk steak, we're gonna
shave it off the bone, we're gonna grind it, smell that? - For those at home, it smells so bad, it's unbelievable, smells like feet. - I'm holding it up to her face. All the moisture leaches out of it, and it actually creates some enzymes to give it this really
funky, barnyard-y flavor. - Oh barnyard, that does
not sound appealing, are you trying to sell me on this burger? Barnyard, uch!
- We're gonna get the ostrich egg on the
barnyard, it's gonna be great. - Ostrich and barnyard, got it. - For our french fries,
we're gonna be frying it in duck fat
- Whoa! - Molonay savory ketchup, made from 150 year old family recipe. Animal style, right? Really important part is the
mustard smear on the patties so we have moutarde rayale-- - What'd you call me? (both laughing) - All right, don't cancel me. This is a mustard with cognac in it, we're gonna smear that on the patties. - That is so fancy looking, that's the fanciest
looking thing we have here. - And then, well this is
pretty much just a cucumber. - I hate cucumbers. Why are we putting cucumber on a burger? - We need pickles for the thousand island we also have some living butter lettuce, it's fancy 'cause it's got dirt on it. - Oh!
- All right, you ready to start cookin'? - I'm ready to start cookin', I've been ready.
- We got it. What?
- Hm? - Oh I thought you were sayin-- - No you were saying. - No no you're good
- I, you-- - I always hang up first! - Okay
- I'm not gonna hang up first! - You wanna choose a knife off the wall? You can start cuttin'! Everyone goes right for that knife, the thing with that knife is that there's soles trapped in the hilt. - It makes me feel like
I'm a soldier, like Rambo! - All right so we need
perfect quarter inch cuts. That actually is pretty good,
you're maulin' it a little bit I'm gonna put it in this bowl. - Oh, someones a sue chef now. - There ya go, that's pretty good! Pretty good
- Watch out In-N-Out here I come. - I don't say this often
but I'm proud of you. - Can you call me your daughter for the rest of the show, that would be really fulfilling for me. - Daughter you've left a last impression. - Thanks, dad! - I'm uncomfortable, can we stop this? - No, keep rolling, keep
rolling, keep rolling! - Christine, have you
ever made pickles before? What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
sprinkle salt on each layer. So you're gonna go ahead
and rub all over on it. (Christine laughing) Just rub all over on it. - Rub all over on it. - I did not stutter, Christine. You're gonna pick 'em up
and you wanna rub the salt into it physically and you'll
notice when you do that, there's actually gonna
be juice on your hands, that mean the moisture is
coming out of the pickle, so you're essentially curing
it and it's gonna give it that snappy texture.
- Is this how they make all pickles? This seems very unsanitary. - Not all pickles, but-- - Fancy pickles? - Just fancy pickles
- Hand rubbed? - Why can't I get this off? - Because you haven't taken
the foil all the way off. - You know what, I used to be a server, I can do this, okay? Whoa! - That worked out better than it could've. What we're gonna do is I'm gonna put the entire bottle in here. - The entire bottle? - Then we're gonna start-- We're gonna use three
different reduction levels, three different techniques in it, we're gonna put the
entire bottle of champagne into our burgers and
fries by the end of it. Do you want some? - No, I'm doing sober time. I'll feed it to you though. Like a baby bird. - [Josh] This garlic
you actually wanna take your Rambo knife and you're just gonna-- Gonna bash it
- Okay, gonna bash it. - That's gonna release the alocin in it? - Whose alcoin? - You don't know alocin? - Is this a drug? - No, this is not a drug, no no. It's a compound inside garlic that-- - Is it named after like
a middle school teacher? - Yes
- I hate cucumbers so I don't know anything
about them except that they're like colder than the room
than they're in by like five degrees and that's why you say cool as a cucumber. - That's a real thing?
- Mhm - Touch it to my face. That is cold!
- It's cold! - I'm learning so much. - We're both learning! I'm learning about alocin - That's so alocin too.
- That's so alocin. - [Josh] Gonna pour this right in our pickle jar. So we got all that salt, all that acid, little bit of sweetness in the champagne, just hold the hot jar, it feels nice. - Oh, it feels cozy.
- It's deceptively cold in this kitchen. So fries typically, you know-- Little square, loggy situation. - I'm square.
- You're super cool! Christine, you're the
coolest person I know. In-N-Out, they cut the potatoes fresh and they just drop them
into the fryer but for me, that's not the best way
to make a french fry. Best way to make a fresh fry
is cooking it at least twice and we're actually
going to triple cook it. - A lot of people judge me
because I like my fries fry light which is where they're super soggy. - I can make you a couple
fry light fries if you want. - Thanks dad!
- No problem Allison! Then I'm gonna take these and I'm gonna put 'em
into our boiling water. Got some big boys in there! - Ha-ha-ha - You got some big old fries
- How skinny do you want them? - Just like cut that in half. You kinda have--
- Square it off. - You kind of have good technique, you're tucking your fingers-- - Oh I cut my fingers a lot, trust me. And my step dad, he has like nubbies because he's cut the
tips of his fingers off. - Doin' what? - I think like construction or something. - Oh, I thought it was like ya-kuza. - Is that a sword? - No, yakuzas a-- Nevermind. I forget a slotted spoon so I'm just gonna take these
out with my hands I guess. Help, Nicole, help! Oh Trevor, thank you! - [Trevor] Of course! - I have two Nicoles now. I don't know, which one
to look at sometimes. So the potatoes are lightly blanched. We're gonna go ahead-- - Blanche, whose Blanche? - From the Golden Girls!
- Blanche, Allison-- - Don't you know the Golden Girls? - They're very hard to cut! - Can I cut some more potatoes here? - In-N-Out has a machine,
I'm not a machine! - Be the machine, okay. Are you okay? - You know, meltdowns happen. - I'm fine, I'm fine being the
bad boy of the cooking world. - The bad boy of the cooking world, uch!
- You know? - Another chef with sleeve tattoos, the bad boy of cooking,
okay real original! Just like with the arms crossed lookin' like super pissed. You should be the person
whose like wearing a cape and like holding a kitten. - The good boy of the cooking world? - You should, that would be refreshing. - Wait, is that the stove? - Oh yeah, you can't
put stuff on the stove. - This stove, I swear to God! - So we got the fries and we're gonna continue to blance those, we're gonna shock 'em, then we're gonna go ahead and freeze 'em, we're gonna dry 'em,
we're gonna fry 'em twice, and then we're gonna continue
to have fun with our friends. So, right now
- Mhm - We're gonna get champagne
and a couple more things. It's continue to reduce over there, you remember that, now
pour me a quarter cup of it into that pan
- Um, eyeball it? - Eyeball it!
- Eyeball Quarter cup! - That was good, do a little more. - Quarter cup! That's how measurements work, right? - While that champagne is melting down, we're putting cheese in champagne? - We're gonna drop 'em in-- Yeah, you've never had fondue before? - This is the most french
thing I've ever done. - Yes, this is pretty wild.
- Very French. - All right, what we're
trying to do is make-- - Uh-huh, words? - Hard speak, now.
- Speak now. - The burning on all pan, so tough. Tough, tough, tough! Take that, stir that. - Stir this, oh okay, ahhh! - Ahhh! Are you hurt or are you scared? - No, I'm just scared. - I got
- The cheese was gonna pop into my face. - There, it's going perfectly. Well then, now we're gonna
add our cheddar cheese. Keep stirring, keep stirring, keep stirring.
- I'm stirring! - Now we're gonna caramelize some onions. Yeah you're fine, you're fine. How are you doing? Are you feeling safe? - Last time you cook right in front of me. - Christine, are you feeling safe? - Your safety is my biggest concern. - I'm feeling safe! I feel like I'm camping
but inside and dangerous. - You never go camping,
you never take me camping. - You never take me
camping, I've never been-- You've never offered me once-- - I'm not your real dad, I don't know how many times I have to say that!
- I know! - I don't have a child that I know of. We could all have children. - You could have a
child you don't know of. - If you're Josh's child or you think you may be
Josh's child, comment below. - Christine, chop those
onions as you can, be safe. Make sure your hands not near it. Just, don't-- Yeah go, yeah-- - You know I was never
hired at a fast food place, I applied to many, but
none of them hired me and I think I know why. - So if you look at that--
- Oh! - Some beautiful cheese
fondue, do you wanna try it? What does it taste like? - Mmm, it's really good! Oh my God, yeah. - Now we're gonna take this, pour it out onto our silicone mat. - [Christine] This makes
me feel like a chef. - [Josh] And then when we spread it out, it's actually going to set in cheese. - It does look like In-N-Out. Does this help it? - Actually that does help it, yeah keep doing that. - Hell yeah, dude. - So we got our champagne reducing, keep movin' those around and
then we're just gonna take some of that reducing
champagne, you see how it's got a darker color to it
- Yeah - [Josh] Nice and caramel-y. And we're just gonna put that in there, that's gonna continue to cook down. Okay, so these need about
another 45 minutes to caramelize. - 45 minutes!
- Yip! - So some would say that
we should start with like tryin' to see if we could open it with like a hard wack of a spoon and then if that doesn't work, we should move up to a power drill. But we already have the power drill. Kill it, oh my God it's alive, Christine! - Ahhh!
- It's alive! You gotta kill it!
- Ahhh! - We gotta, oh my God, okay. - Scrambled!
- Yeah sorry the yolks a little bit broken but
pour a little bit in there, I'll tell ya when, I'll
tell ya when, tell ya when. - Say when, I feel like-- - That's good, that's good, that's good! Then we got a little bit of
this fancy cognac mustard. Ahhh, whoa!
- Oh my God. - I thought this was a lid.
- Everything is fall apart. - I thought this was like a fake - Unexpectedly. It's a cork? Who puts cork on-- mustard?
- What's happening! I don't understand. - Why would you do this
for a jar of mustard? (Christine screams) - Keep going, just hold it. - How is this so much work to get mustard? This mustard-- - There's a couple rabbit turds. - That's straight up cork, yo. It' kind of sad that we
couldn't open a jar of mustard. We're trying to make food? - Sad or inspiring? This is just peanut oil. - Peanut oil, why peanut oil? - I like peanut oil,
it's a nice neutral oil, very light color, can
make a lovely mayonnaise. - Is this supposed to be mostly oil? - Yeah, that's what mayonnaise is. - But like this much oil? - Oh yeah!
- I know nothing about mayonnaise. - Mayonnaise is an
emulsification of eggs and oil with a little bi of acid
salt and the flavor like mustard to help it out. - Strong stream, I have to eat this? - No, you get to eat this. - Yes, of course. - Great. It's got--
- Oh, okay. - The consistency like mayonnaise, it's gonna tighten up a little bit, the blender got a little hot. We're gonna pour our mayonnaise in there. - It actually looks like mayonnaise. - It does
- It doesn't look disgusting like I thought it would. Dub dub dub dub, good? - That's% probably good,
that's probably good. And then can you also squeeze
some tomato paste in there we need some even extra
concentrated flavor. Did you say that looks
like Quinton Terrintino? - Look at him, Quinton Terrintino
is making tomato paste. - Last bit we need to do, our little bits of pickles. - Feel like a lady eating
a champagne pickle, it's so good! It's not. - Well, if you think
about it has a pickle, yeah so not all fancy things taste great. Sometimes the fanciest
things are the worse things. Chop these super fine.
- Chop chop chop chop chop chop chop!
- It does look like red. - It looks like red.
- Like it's got-- Oh that's really good. - I've never had ostrich egg before. - Why? - It's good!
- It's good. - It's like it's red - It looks red!
- It's red, yay! - It's got a little more bite to it. I don't think the ostrich
egg adds anything to it. - No
- But we sure had a fun time tracking down those ostriches. - Listen, I have never used a power drill, never seen an ostrich before,
a lot of firsts for me. - Do you know I'm afraid the
ostrich made an aggressive sexual display at me? - Oh yeah, I think you liked it though, you had it coming. I shouldn't say that,
no one had it coming. He didn't ask, he didn't say-- - Oh God, oh no, oh no - Oh God, oh God-- It's good, I actually wanna eat more but I'm not going to because
it's a big bowl of mayonnaise. - Do you wanna put it on a bunch of fries and a hamburger? - Yeah!
- Yeah! All right, so you got this big
old nice fresh tomahawk chop. - Still smells so gross. - That gross smell that you're smelling, I think smells really good. 'Cause to me, that's just
dry aged grass fed beef. - Okay, how do I turn this on? - Light her up, Christine!
- Ahhh! - All right, so you're gonna see some nice fat comin' out of there. That's great, that's what we want. All right, great. - I feel like you know
your way around a grinder. - Downloaded it once
just to see what it was but um, and then we're just gonna go ahead and form that into patties and then get it right onto our grill. - Oh okay! - All right, you wanna salt that burger? - Bam! - The In-N-Out animal style, they mustard grill their patties which means they smear
mustard directly on it and then fry that into the grill, gonna get a nice caramelization on it. - Oh we got that cork in there still. One for me, one for you! - And now we're gonna
make a divet in the middle with our fingers
- What's that for? - That's gonna prevent
the burger from turning into like a softball, so it's
gonna keep it nice and flat. We do want some thick burgers though. - Okay - 'Cause why, we're thick boys! - You're a thick boy?
- Uh-oh! - Thick boy culture.
- We're fine. - Why'd you say uh-oh? - Now we're just gonna take this and we're gonna slap that down there. We're gonna use our spatula kinda really smash that in there. - Like Spongebob!
- Just like Spongebob! - And a one, and a two,
and a step back and run. All right, that's hella
burnt, that's great. That's what we wanted, that
means this ones probably gonna be hella burnt too. That's fine, we're gonna
cover it in cheese! All right, so not we're gonna
take these blanched fries and we're gonna throw them in the oil, about 325 degrees
- Okay, I feel like we're always
deep frying things together. - Yeah we always are, I kinda like it. - Yeah, it's like our thing. It's like when we get together, we're gonna throw some
things in some hot oil. We fry things, that's our thing! - We rangle large birds, and we fry splattery things. I actually, this is the
thing I like to do with fries because it'll actually
get a little bit of air underneath the skin, and
will kinda get them to be a little extra crispy. Just jimmy it, that's great. - Allison, Blanche, Jimmy, all the names. - All the names, we're
gonna put those back in the freezer and then
we're gonna cook 'em a third time in slightly hotter oil. - Freezer?
- Yeah yeah yeah - You're wild.
- It's what you gotta do. You're wild! - Imagine if you just had
this in your apartment. A deep fryer? I'd come over all the time. Hey I got some falafels,
let's fry those up. - I do have one in my apartment. - You do? - Do you wanna hang out? - Yeah! - All right!
- We're friends! - I made a f, fa, fa, friend-- - We're friends becoming real friends. Champagne for my real friends. Cham-- - Pain cham for my cham, wows. All right we got our
triple cooked fries there. But they're not just normal fries. They're-- - Animal style fries. - And that means? - Cheese caramelized onions
and your super special sauce. - We're gonna take the cheese and we're gonna melt that.
- Love it! - Just a couple seconds.
- Love that for us. - [Josh] Animal style means extra spread so we're gonna go, extra spread. - Pickles--
- The pickles, try and shake the liquid off. - Won't be the last time I've
been told to shake liquid. - When was the first time? - It was also pickle related. - We're gonna put chopped chilis on because I think you just
learned about chopped chilies in the drive-thru
- Yes! Oh my God, that was such a genius thing, I didn't even know that was something you could do at In-N-Out - Right, so we're doin' chopped
collabean chilis on there. I'm gonna move these to the bottom-- - [Christine] All right,
fair enough, fair enough. - That does it
- Ah, your mits. - Beautiful. - Your manly mits. - Oh no, lift it up, put the tomatoes on. - Oh right! Coming! - Yeah, that's great, that's great. Oh lettuce, lettuce, lettuce. - Lettuce!
- Yeah yeah lettuce first. Good, that worked out perfectly. And then all we need to do
is sauce up that top bun. - Sauce the top. - I am too, I am lost in the sauce. 20 year old AP Trevor
taught me that phrase. Thanks Trevor. - [Trevor] Oh course, Josh! - All right, the cheese is
nice and floppily melted over the top, it's not super super runny. - Look at that!
- We don't want it to be. And we're just gonna drape. - It like messes your thing though. - Caramelized onions, yeah. I eat over the trashcan for a reason. Okay well hey, I think we're done! - We're done!
- I think we did it. - We did it! I feel like I need a bib. - We do, first what we need to do. - Compare it?
- Is we need to eat the originals, we got your animal style, protein style, burger. We got my animal style, double
double, with chopped chilis. Just to remember what it tastes like. La chiam, to life! - La chiam, to life! - Mmm, that's a really good hamburger. - This is good
- So good. Got the fries, our fries
are definitely thicker. And this, does lift up like a brick. We're doing great.
- Successful! - We're doin' awesome.
- Whoa! - Okay
- Okay - Let's slice that in half. All right. Wow, the burgers look strange. They look a little strange. The dry aged beef,
definitely cooks differently. - It smells still a little-- - It smells very funky. It is a very funky dry aged beef. Um, I gotta-- That's a fancy thing, dry aged beef. Like wow, really fancy. - I'm gonna let you bite into it first 'cause I'm scared, it
smells a little funky. Ugh, blech, sorry. I'm scared of the smell. - Yeah, sometimes you're
scared of the smell and you just gotta shove
your face right in. - And how does it taste? You're not giving me any words-- - Salty.
- Salty? - Salty, a little bit of funk. - Do I have to eat it?
- A little bit of funk on the nose but you
gotta at least act like you're enjoying it for
the sake of the camera. - Okay, you spent a lot of money on this. I can't get over the smell! - Yeah!
- Food does not smell okay. - Eat this, eat this! Dry aged beef, is not for everyone. It's not for Christine. - It's not for me. - Sometimes
- I'm a street rat. - Eat the fries, eat the fries. Kill the fries.
- Street rat! I don't buy that! - And these actually look
really melty and delicious. - Yeah
- That is a sexy bite right there!
- Mhm Okay, this is good. The fries, lovin' the fries. - Mmmm, the whole time,
we were tasting the fries. - We're always tasting the fries. - [Josh] We got distracted by the beef, we got lost in the beef. - [Christine] Lost in the beef. - [Josh] But we got found from the sauce. - The ostrich egg sauce. How much did this cost? - Well this cost 314 dollars and 81 cents. So that's a fair amount. - How much did In-N-Out cost? - I think like 12 dollars. These fries are very stupidly delicious. - They're very good. - I'm lovin' these
- I'm lovin' the fries. - This spread is incredible, the cheese and cheese of the champagne actually gives you a really
delicious kinda complex flavor. Did it with the onions, the
burger, it's a little funky. Look not all fancy things
are gonna taste good. - Yeah
- But you gotta be there for the good, the bad and the ugly. And the utterly putrid and repulsive. - Mhm! - I hope that beef wasn't rotten, I hope we're okay
- I hope we're okay! - [Josh] I hope we're okay - I'll see you at the urgent care. - I'll see you at the urgent
care and I'll see you all next time, next week we
got another fancy fast food comin' on Tuesday. We got another recipe video
coming next week also, thanks for stoppin' by, catch ya later. The fries are good.
- They're so good. - Fries are good!
- Good. - [Josh] Get as messy as

dGiQaabX3_o,Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell,Science,What Happened Before History? Human Origins,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGiQaabX3_o,5 years ago,19M views,Science,"The world we live in feels normal, ordinary. It feels like this is just how humans exist and always existed. But, it's not. Never before have we humans lived in a world as sophisticated and engineered to our needs as today. Giving us the luxury to forget about ourselves and not worry about survival. Food, shelter, security – all of this is, more or less, taken for granted. But we're a special few; for more than 99.99% of human history, life was completely different. And there's no such thing as just one human history. Our story begins 6 million years ago, when the tribe of hominini split and our relationship with the apes ended. 2.8 million years ago, the genus of homo, the first humans, emerged. We like to think about ourselves as the only humans, but this is far from the truth. When we, homo sapiens sapiens, came into existence 200,000 years ago, there were at least six other human species around. Cousins of comparable intelligence and ability, which must have been incredibly scary, kind of like living with aliens. Some of them were very successful. Homo erectus, for example, survived for 2 million years. Ten times longer than modern humans have existed. The last of the other humans disappeared around 10,000 years ago. We don't know what caused them to die out. Modern humans have at least a few percent of neanderthal and other human DNA, so there was some mixing, but certainly not enough to be a merger between species. So we don't know if our cousins went away because they lost the battle over resources, or because of a series of minor genocides. Either way, only we remain. Back to the beginnings of humanity. 2.8 million years ago, early humans used tools, but did not make a lot of progress for nearly 2 million years. Until they learned to control fire. Fire meant cooking, which made food more nutritious, which contributed to the development of our brain. It also produced light and warmth, which made days longer and winters less gruesome. On top of that, it not only scared predators away, it could also be used for hunting. A torched wood or grassland provided small animals, nuts and tubers that were pre-roasted. From 300,000 years ago, most of the different human species lived in small hunter-gatherer societies. They had fire, wood and stone tools, planned for the future, buried their dead, and had cultures of their own. But most importantly, they spoke to each other. Probably in a kind of proto-language, less complex than ours. If we had a time machine, how far would we be able to go back, steal a few babies and raise them today without anyone noticing that they're a bit different? There is much debate. Anatomically, modern humans emerged 200,000 years ago, but probably 70,000 years is as far as we could travel back and still snatch a behaviourally modern human. Before that, the babies would probably lack a few crucial gene mutations Necessary to build a brain with modern language and abstract thinking abilities. At some point, around 50,000 years ago, there was an explosion in innovation. Tools and weapons became more sophisticated and culture became more complex, because at this point, humans had a multi-purpose brain, and a more advanced language to communicate information with each other effectively, and down to the last detail. This allowed much closer cooperation, and is what really makes us different from any other creature on Earth. Not our comparatively weak bodies and inferior senses, but the ability to cooperate flexibly in large groups, unlike, for example, rigid beehives or intimate, but tiny wolf packs. As our brain evolved, we became able to do something, life had been unable to do up to this point. One – expand knowledge quickly. Two – preserve the knowledge gained over generations. Three – build on past knowledge, to gain even deeper insight. This seems daft, but until then, information had to be passed on from generation to generation, mostly through genetics, which is not efficient. Still, for the next 40,000 years, human life remained more or less the same. There was little to build upon. Our ancestors were only one animal among many. Building a skyscraper without knowing what a house is… is hard. But while it is easy to be arrogant in our attitude to our ancestors, this would be ignorant. Humans 50,000 years ago were survival specialists. They had a detailed mental map of their territory, their senses were fine-tuned to the environment, they knew and memorized a great amount of information about plants and animals. They could make complicated tools that required years of careful training and very fine motor skills Their bodies compared to our athletes today just because of their daily routines, and they lived a rich social life within their tribe Survival required so many skills that the average brain volume of early modern humans might even have been bigger than it is today As a group we know more today, but as individuals our ancestors were superior to us But then around 12,000 years ago, in multiple locations, humans developed agriculture. Everything changed very quickly. Before, survival as a hunter and forager required superb physical and mental abilities in all fields from everybody With the rise of the agricultural age, individuals could increasingly rely on the skills of others for survival. This meant that some of them could specialize. Maybe they worked on better tools, maybe they took time to breed more resistant crops or better livestock, Maybe they started inventing things. As farming got more and more efficient, what we call civilization began Agriculture gave us a reliable and predictable food source, which allowed humans to hoard food on a large scale for the first time, which is much easier to do with grains than meat, The food stock required protection, which led to communities living together in tighter spaces First, early defense structures were built, the need for organization grew The more organized we got, the faster things became efficient Villages became cities, cities became kingdoms, kingdoms became empires Connections between humans exploded which led to opportunities to exchange knowledge Progress became exponential About 500 years ago the Scientific Revolution began Mathematics, Physics, Astronomy, Biology, and Chemistry transformed everything we thought we knew The Industrial Revolution followed soon after laying the foundation for the modern world As our overall efficiency grew exponentially, more people could spend their lifetime contributing to the progress of humanity Revolutions kept happening. The invention of the computer, its evolution into a medium we all use on a daily basis, and the rise of the Internet shaped our world It's hard to grasp how fast all of that happened It's been about 125,000 generations since the emergence of the first human species About 7,500 generations since the physiologically modern humans saw the light of day 500 generations ago, what we call civilization began 20 generations ago, we learned how to do science And the Internet became available to most people only one generation ago Today we live in the most prosperous age humanity has ever experienced We have transformed this planet, from the composition of its atmosphere to large-scale changes in its landscape and also in terms of the other animals in existence. We light up the night with artificial stars and put people in a metal box in the sky Some have even walked on our Moon We put robots on other planets We've looked deep into the past of the universe with mechanical eyes Our knowledge and our way of acquiring and storing more of it has exploded The average high school student today knows more about the universe than a scholar a few centuries ago Humans dominate this planet, even if our rule is very fragile We are still not that different from our ancestors 70,000 years ago But your lifestyle has existed for less than 0.001% of human history From here on, there's no saying what the future holds for us We're building a skyscraper, but we're not sure if it's standing on a solid foundation or if we're building it on quicksand Let's leave it with that for now The next time you miss your train, your burger is not hot enough, or someone cuts in line Remember how special this made-up human world is Maybe it's not worth being upset about all those little things. OK, so this was our first take on making a history-related video we'd love to make much more of them, but they take even more time than our average video. So we might do 3 or 4 a year.

qevIIQHrJZg,Veritasium,Science,This Unstoppable Robot Could Save Your Life,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qevIIQHrJZg,9 months ago,23M views,Science,"- This is a robot that can grow to hundreds of times its size, and it can't be stopped
by adhesives or spikes. Although it looks kind
of simple and cheap, it has dozens of potential applications, including, one day maybe saving your life. This video is sponsored by Morning Brew, the free daily newsletter. Now I made a video before
about a soft truss robot. And this is also a soft robot, but very different in how
it works and what it can do. These robots can be made
out of almost any material, but they all follow the
same basic principle. Powered by compressed air,
they grow from the tip. (air hissing)
(object rustling) - That's good. - And this allows the robot
to pass through tight spaces, and also over sticky surfaces. - Something like a car
will get stuck to it. (car winding) It gets stuck in the wheels. Now, if I do the same
thing with the vine robot, see the robot is able to extend... - It can navigate this
curvy and twisted passageway effortlessly, which suggests some of the applications it's well-suited for. Now you might think spikes
would be the downfall of an inflatable robot, but even if it's punctured, as long as you have
sufficient air pressure, the robot keeps going. - And you might be able to hear it. (air hissing)
It's actually leaking now, so I'll have to turn up the pressure. (object rustling)
(air hissing) This by itself is not yet a robot, but once we add steering,
a camera, some sensors, and maybe some intelligence as
to where we're directing it, then we could say it's a robot. So this is sort of the
backbone of our robot. This is what allows us to
build our type of robots. - So where did the idea
for this device come from? - I had a vine in my
office that was on a shelf, and it was kind of out of the sunlight. And over the course of like a year or so, it slowly grew out this tender roll out and around the edge of the shelf and towards the sunlight. I said, ""That's a pretty cool
thing it just did,"" right? So I started thinking, ""Well is there a way you
can do that robotically?"" - The solution is really
elegant in its simplicity. Just take some airtight tubing
and fold it in on itself. It's kind of like a water wiggle, those toys that are really hard to hold. (air hissing)
When you inflate it with compressed air, it starts
growing out from the tip. And if you want the tube to
always bend at a certain spot, you could just tape the
tubing on the outside to shorten one of the sides. For example, you could tape
it into a helical shape to create a deployable antenna. What about getting them to retract? - Yeah, that's a challenging problem. When you're in a constrained environment, all you really have to do is pull on, we call it the tail, so the material that is passing through the core of the body, you pull on it and it basically ungrows, it just goes back inside itself. Now, if you're in a big
open area like this, and you try pulling on that, instead of inverting, so retracting, it tends to kind of coil
up and make a ugly shape. - And the engineers have come up with ways to retract the tube to
prevent it from buckling using internal rollers. But the two doesn't have
to be the same diameter the whole way along, here there's actually
a much wider section, think of it like a pillow that's packed into the end of the robot. - Yeah, if you could
sit cross-legged on it. - Cross-legged on the table. This sounds (groans) super sketchy. - So it grows underneath
the table just as usual, and then as the pillow
part starts inflating, (object clattering)
(man mumbles) Is this not good, or is this okay? It can actually lift me up. So my balance is not great as we can see. - You're standing on it. - Stand on it?
- Yeah. - What's amazing is that this
doesn't require much pressure above atmospheric, just a 10th of an atmosphere applied over a large
area like a square meter can lift something as
heavy as 1000 kilograms, all the while remaining soft. (object rustling)
Oh. Whoa, (sighs) that was great. That's the paradoxical
thing about pressure. You can get a large overall
force with low pressure as long as the area is large enough. What sort of area is
that, that pillow there? - It's 600 square inches. All right, so with one
PSI it's 600 pounds. - Yeah.
- Yeah. (laughs) - Two PSI is 1200 pounds.
- That's just crazy. And the whole time it feels really soft. - Yeah, 'cause there's
a couple PSI, right? - It's important that
the device is still soft so it doesn't hurt anyone. - So you can design these things to have cross-section that
changes along its length. So it can be a very small body that could grow into, for
example, a collapsed building and potentially lift a large object off someone who's trapped, or maybe in a car crash
or something like that. It can apply huge forces with very soft
(air whooshing) and lightweight cheap material. - These robots can also be deployed in search and rescue operations by attaching sensors like
a camera onto the front. - These robots are actually
really hard to stop. So you can take them,
grow them into a clutter, potentially a class building
or something like that, and they will continue to go somewhere. And alternative is they're so cheap, I mean, they're basically free. You could grow a hundred
of them, let's say, into a collapsed building
with some sensing on them, and maybe only one of them finds somebody. I mean, that's a huge success if it does. - But how do you keep a camera connected to the front of the robot when
it grows out from the tip? Well, one way is to use an end cap which allows that camera
just to stay on the front, pushed from behind by the robot, but there are other
mechanisms of attachment. The tiny wireless camera is
mounted on an external frame, but this frame interlocks
with an internal frame which is actually inside
the pressurized part of the robot body. It's similar to how a
roller coaster's wheels go around the track. So this prevents the
camera from falling off as the robot grows. What's really interesting is how the vine robot
can be actively steered. They attach artificial
muscles to the robot. (air hissing) So the way this muscle works is that if you inflate
it, it expands sideways, which leads to it contracting in length. - We don't actually use these much anymore because although it's soft,
it's still somewhat stiff. So what we use instead are simply tubes of this
ripstop nylon fabric with the braid oriented at 45 degrees. So in this sense we just have one single
layer of airtight fabric. (air hissing) This is the main robot body here, then we have three pneumatic
muscles connected to it. Now, these three muscles are each connected to their own air supply connected to regulators over here. As the robot extends from the tip, we can steer it by shortening
and lengthening the sides. So, you know, just the way your hand works is if I shorten this tendon in my arm my hand will move this way, or if I shorten the one on this side it'll move the other way. So our vine robot, we have
these muscles along its side, so as they inflate
they'll turn it one way, then if I deflate the
one on the other side, it'll turn the other way. - So the vine robot can
fit through tight spaces. It doesn't typically get stuck on anything and isn't bothered by sharp objects. And once you attach that
camera on the front, it's ideal for things like archeology. (group chattering)
(objects clanking) The robot was actually taken to Peru to investigate some very narrow shafts. - So we were looking at
this archeological site that was built somewhere
between 1500 and 500 BC in the Andes mountains of Peru, and it was an ancient temple that had all these underground spaces. And part of what the
archeologists were doing was trying to understand
what the spaces were for and what the people who built them were trying to do with them. So part of that was unknown, but there were these giant rooms
that they called galleries, and then there were these
small ducts or tunnels that were offshoots of these rooms, and they wanted to know
where these ducts led but they were too small
for a person to go in. So we were able to
successfully use the vine robot to explore three of the tunnels that couldn't have been
seen through other means, which was super exciting. And we got video inside the entire tunnels and gave it to the archeology team. - There's an application where I feel like this
solution is just so obvious I wonder why it didn't exist before. - Intubation is literally
the process of putting a tube into a patient. The purpose is to breathe for the patient when the patient isn't breathing. And so traditionally a highly
trained medical professional would take their laryngoscope, come above the patient, and once they see the trachea, you start to pass your tube down inside. I'm almost there, I can see the light. So if you can see right now I just got it in to the trachea. - Oh yeah.
- Right there. And it took me a couple of minutes and I was really kind of
wrenching on this patient here as if there's somebody
who's not breathing. Every second counts. - But by using a miniature
version of this vine robot, researchers are hoping to make
intubation faster and safer. - You know, somebody
like me with no training could pretty simply insert this device aimed towards the nose and... (object squealing) just like that. If you can see, we've already intubated, and all it took was a little
bit of pressurization. (man laughs) Just like that. - It almost looks like
sort of a party favor. - Yeah, right. This reminds me a lot of those inflatable kind of like play-doh
structures you see at car lots. - How does it know to
go down the right tube? - Yeah, so that's one of
the kind of cool things about soft robotics, is the robot is quite compliant. And we see that in a lot of these demos, you know, they can squish, they can bend. And so how we've designed it is that the main robot grows
down into the esophagus, and then we have this side branch that heads towards the trachea, and it's quite flexible and so it basically finds the opening. So it's a really neat example of kind of a passive intelligence, mechanical intelligence
some people call it, where it can find its path even if we don't know
exactly the shape beforehand. - Have you tried this
on a real person yet? - Not on a real person, but we've actually tried
this in a cadaver lab. And we've shown that we can move from this nice idealized version to an actual in-vivo situation and successfully intubate a patient. - There's another application which is burrowing into sand or soil. When you blow compressed air
into something like sand, it fluidizes, it becomes like a liquid, and that can allow the vine robot to grow into granular materials like sand. - If you've ever been to the beach and you try to stick like you
umbrella pole into the ground, it's fairly difficult. - And I'm trying to push that
probe down into the sand, no fluid decision. - Yeah, it feels like it
sort of gets wedged in there. - Let's now turn on the air. (air hissing) - Oh yeah. You can feel it immediately. Oh, wow. Yeah, that's a lot. - So what we've done here is essentially, we just blow a jet of air
out the front of the robot and that loosens up the sand enough to reduce the force of the sand so that the robot just by tip extension can make its way through. (air hissing) - This makes vine robots an
attractive option for NASA when they look for ways
to study the surfaces of other planets. (machine roaring) Recently on Mars they tried to have a burrowing
robot but it got stuck. Could you do it better
basically with this? - Yeah, that's a good question. So the Mars InSight mission,
they have this heat probe, the idea there was to be able
to sort of hammer its way down into the core,
and then place a sensor that could detect the temperature of Mars. However, the problem they ran into there is that it turned out the
material that they put it in was more cohesive than they expected. Inside the robot something would wind up
and then pound it down, wind up and pound it down. But it turned out there
wasn't enough friction between the probe and the sand. So what was really happening was it would wind up pound
down, wind up pound down, wind up pound down. So it never actually got anywhere. The advantage of something
like this, like tip extension, is you'd have your base,
you start at the surface and you just keep extending your way down. You're not necessarily
relying on the interaction with what is surrounding
it to make it work. - What amazes me about vine robots is how a plant inspired
this simple, elegant design. It's so easy in fact that
you could build one yourself in as little as a minute. There are instructions
online that I'll link to. But from that basic design have come a huge variety of robots with different applications, from archeology to search and rescue, or intubation to space exploration. And what else can you
think of to do with it? (electronic buzzing) Hey, this video is

it7v4ATUEhc,Mythical Kitchen,Food,Flamin' Hot Pop-Tarts Taste Test | SNACK SMASH,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it7v4ATUEhc,2 years ago,1.4M views,Food,"- What up, it's your boy Josh
also known as Claire Saffitz, also known as Brad Leone
also known as Chris Morocco. And it's that time again. To watch me give birth to
a brand new baby snack. We asked you which two snacks
you'd want to see smashed and you said Pop-Tarts, Flamin' Hot Cheetos. Will this new snack be a smash? Find out, 'cause this is Snack Smash. (upbeat music) So we're starting the
Flamin' Hot Cheeto Pop-Tarts with the copycat Flamin' Hot seasoning, which is my pride and joy. Like the way a grandma might pass down her 7 UP poundcake recipe. It's the way that I'm
gonna pass this recipe on to my three sons, Bort,
Japheth and Balthimos. Obviously you have the spice. That's probably just coming
from a ton of cayenne. Add in a tablespoon. Another tablespoon. And then there's actually
a lot of savory elements in the Flamin' Hot Cheetos seasoning. So that's gonna be onion, garlic, (coughs) so many fumes, and white pepper. That tends to be a trifecta
in a lot of snack foods. And then we have our
red powdered food dye. I eat way too much food dye on this show. Like I'm just gonna die, and
they're gonna cut open my body and just like a rainbow river
is gonna flood out of me and it's gonna be beautiful. There's going to be a lot of salt. Another thing makes Flamin'
Hot Cheetos so addictive, M-S-G. This is like the life blood
of the entire chip industry. About a tablespoon and a half in there. And then another thing that you don't necessarily think about is the citric acid involved
in Flamin' Hot Cheetos. They're actually really quite sour. It almost gives you like
a sort of lime flavor. 'Bout a half tablespoon,
one and a half teaspoons. People just think of
Flamin' Hot Cheetos as hot, but there actually is a fair amount of cheese flavor in there, that just really gets dominated by spice. So that means we're gonna do a lot of this dehydrated cheddar and it's actually gonna
add color to it too. And then for an additional dairy kick, we're gonna do buttermilk powder. I'll abbreviate that as butt-milk. This probably isn't in
Flamin' Hot Cheetos. This is straight up ghost chilli powder. So just put a little bit
of ghost chilli in there. And those are giant clumps that went in. Did you see that? And then we're gonna pop this
right into our spice grinder. Uh oh it's overflowing. Uh oh I'm breathing in the dust. Uh oh! (blender grinding) I've learned now, I'm not
gonna breathe in the fumes and then I'm not gonna
cough all over the food. I'm gonna open it and then
immediately blow it out. (blowing air loudly) And that's how it's done. Gotta suck on another Cheeto (coughs). (coughs) (soft chewing) Um, that's hot, that's
hot though, I like that. That's good. - [Director] Okay, let's cut. (crew laughing) - So you're gonna find in the filling of a strawberry Pop-Tart, they're
using all of dried fruits. And we could use fresh fruit, but like we're not trying
to make this fancy. We're trying to make this
exactly how Pop-Tart would do it. Pop-Tart filling is this like stodgy, vaguely fruit-reminiscent paste, that has almost nothing
to do with real fruit. And so they use dried
strawberries, some pears in there. Shout out to all the pears,
shout out to Rick Ross. God, I hope anyone gets that reference. And then there's obviously just going to be a ton of corn syrup, because we're working
with packaged goods here. 'Cause corn syrup makes
the world go 'round. Shout out to corn farmers subsidies. They're ruining America. And then more sugar. And then also, just to kinda of... Then also just to kind of hit a little bit more of that fruit flavor, we're gonna put some citric acid in there, because your gonna get less acid and more sugars when
you dry the fruit out. I had this thing in my pocket. This is a very concentrated
bottle of strawberry extract, that has actually been leaking for the last like three months and it's all over all my clothes now. We're gonna get some Flamin'
Hot Cheeto dust in there. And then just walk away, just walk away for a couple seconds. That way it can't hurt you. Spices and sugar don't
typically go together, because if you've seen the
movie ""Sugar and Spice"", it'll just end up with
cheerleaders robbing a bank. So we're gonna go head and take this filling, and we're gonna... So we're just gonna crush some of that up. Pop it in there. If it's not stodgy enough we'll
just add some more Cheetos and blend it up (claps hands). Get more into the air. Turn this on. It's gonna scorch my hand. (blender grinding) Okay. Yeah, this is real nice and pasty. You can see it's like
holding its shape at the end. That is exactly what we want. There's that huge punch
of artificial extract, that like brings you away from Cheeto and straight into Pop-Tart. That's rad. All right so now we have
to make our Pop-Tart. Sorry I got pepper in my eye. Now it's time to make the Pop-Tart dough. This part is really easy because it (blows raspberry). This part is really easy because I'm basically trying to make the crappiest pie dough possible, because that's what Pop-Tarts uses. So here's a bunch of the
cheapest all purpose flour. It might just be cut with like wood. Since Pop-Tart dough is so dense. I'm not gonna use butter. I'm just gonna use straight up shortening. We're gonna put a bunch of Crisco. We're going for, I don't know, this much. We'll get some water in there. And then corn syrup. Corn syrup is just in
literally everything. If you ever have any doubts on
how to make a copycat recipe. Pour a bunch of corn syrup into it. Then the last part is
making it just a super deep, real messed up
poisonous-looking shade of red. Then take a nice deep
breath (inhales deeply). You can't be afraid of
the Flamin' Hot seasoning. Flamin' Hot seasoning
gotta be afraid of you. And then soy lecithin. Lecithin is the stabilizer
that's actually going to, essentially put little
micro-air bubbles in-between the proteins and the fat (coughs). One big power cough gets all
the pepper out of your throat. (blender grinding) I think this is about what
I'm looking for actually. Got to wrap it up, plastic wrap. Okay, and then this just
has to rest in the fridge for about half an hour (kicking thud). (logo chiming) Sorry for interrupting Josh, but I have an important
announcement regarding Josh. From me, Josh. If your enjoying this show you should subscribe to the
Mythical YouTube Channel. If enough people subscribe I'll
get to make even more shows just like this one. And while you're here, go 'head and click the
bell for notifications. Now, back to you Josh (laughs). (logo chiming) To me the tart part of
the Pop-Tart is overrated. I'm a pop man myself. It really just pops
you right in the mouth. So now we gonna have to go
head and make our frosting. Oh no, I guess the pop
refers to the toaster, popping out of the toaster. Most frosting, like a buttercream, would just melt in the toaster. But this, the protein and the egg whites, and a little bit of supplemental
corn starch we're gonna add should, I use should very liberally, get it to toast in the toaster. I almost try and pop it out of
the toaster and then grab it, but sometimes I burn myself. Almost every time I burn myself. Now you're just gonna go
head and whip this on high until the egg whites
get a little bit frothy. Then we're gonna start
gradually adding in our confectioners sugar. (blender grinding) Add in about a cup. Spin it on medium. Naw, spin it on high. Life's too short to go on medium. We're gonna add a fair amount
of Flamin' Hot Cheeto dust. That has now just poisoned
the entire crew (coughs). Power cough, and just pour that in there, you want just enough to
give it a nice rosy hue. And then put a little bit
of corn starch in there, because that should help it
solidify when its toasting. So the box of Pop-Tarts tells you to never leave a toaster
or microwave unattended because it could start a fire. I think you should never leave
a food processor unattended because it might start conspiring with foreign governments against you. (blender grinding) All right this is looking
nice against all odds. Take this out, scrape down the sides. Make it nice and smooth. - [Director] Josh, can you point it toward camera a little bit. - Are you kidding me. The freaking paddle just falls off. What is happening? Great. Put that there. Sprinkles, the best way
I know how to make 'em is just by making a royal icing, piping it into very thin strips. Then we're gonna mix in a lot
more of that Flamin' Hot dust, 'cause we want to see a nice color change. Now I have to mix it. I'm sorry (cough). This is a prison of my own design. You're not having a breakdown. They're all having a breakdown. And you're just gonna start
piping out the sprinkles in thin strips. You cook it till it's done, and then you have sprinkles. You know Pop-Tart was
originally called a fruit scone and a Flamin' Hot Cheeto
was originally called spicy pointy red thing
that is often misshapen, and will send children to the hospital. It wasn't a catchy name,
but it was accurate. Wow these sprinkles look great. They're out of the oven and nothing is wrong with them at all. They're gonna be chopped
into really small bits, 'cause you think about a Pop-Tart. They're not even sprinkles
they're just like little nubs. And you're just gonna chop
these as fine as possible. (logo chiming) Now we're gonna make the actual Pop-Tart. So I'm using legitimate Pop-Tarts, when roll out the dough
to kinda check for size. So I want 'em to be exactly like this. And we're just gonna pinch
off a solid nub of this dough. We're just gonna roll it out as thin as possible. Yeah, we got a nice
little runway of dough. So I'm gonna take a
Pop-Tart just for size. Cut out a nice little
rectangle for yourself. All right, so now we
have to take our filling. So we're gonna spread that. Great. And then I'm gonna attempt
to lift this piece of dough onto that piece of dough. Hmm, hmm. Okay, I can work with this. Lil' Xan if you're out there, you have nothing but my sympathy, 'cause I also can't stop
eating Flamin' Hot Cheetos. I've just never been put
in the hospital for it. All right, they got holes in 'em. You put holes in the
top layer of the dough so there's no steam that forms so it remains incredibly flat. So it looks like it's four across, five up. That's three, four, I count things when I'm panicked. One, two, three, four (laughs). That was so rough that
I forgot how to count. You just, just poke holes in it. That, I mean, yeah, yeah, bake it, cook it. Throw it in the oven until
it looks like a Pop-Tart. It should just be a spicy,
doughy, piece of deliciousness that you can throw right in a toaster. Find out. Snack Smash! Snack Smash. Snack Smash. Against all odds, it was a struggle, but we struggled our way through 'em. And they're here and they
look exactly like Pop-Tarts. So I'm very happy. Then pipe on a nice border here. Thread this out try and set the border. Just kinda give it a... So take some sprinkles. Get a couple of those on there. Look at that. We got ourselves a Flamin' Hot Pop-Tart. Like they say: once you crunch the crunch don't, the much don't crunch, the once you crun-- Now we just have to see if
it actually tastes good, which is a whole 'nother journey. Which is why we have a
couple Mythical crew members coming in to actually give
the final determination. But what's a box of
Pop-Tarts, without the box? Let's see the box, the thing, which is the Pop-Tarts. Flamin' Hot. (upbeat music) Kevin and Matt, thank you for joining me. You'll see that there is
one knife and three people. What's gonna happen? Find out on Snack Mash. - I've seen Dark Knight. - All right, so if you
guys want to open these. - [Kevin] Wow. - [Josh] Right. - [Matt] Wow. - Wow, that's actually impressive. - [Josh] They look like Pop-Tarts. So we're gonna save one to try and toast. I want to look at how this
compares to a normal Pop-Tart. All right, so if you look at these they're roughly the same size. I want to cut them in half
and look at the width, 'cause that's what really matters. - [Matt] That's impressive. - [Josh] That's pretty close. - [Matt] Wow, that's really
good, that's a Pop-Tart. - I legitimate am impressed. - But I'll try and toast
one 'cause I want to see if it'll actually work. 'Cause I really tried to make
the icing work in a toaster, but in the meantime dig into these. - [Kevin] Hmm, hmm. - This looks like a real feel deal thing. - Right off the bat. - Wow, that's a Pop-Tart. - It tastes like a Pop-Tart. - You made a Pop-Tart in your kitchen. - No spice, there's the spice.
- No, there's the spice. - That's something light. - It's a keeper.
- Wow man. - But it is quintessentially Pop-Tart, and how almost like
just kind of like tender and melt in your mouth it is. It's not flaky, it's not light. And then the icing it has that kind of like
signature crunch to it. - This is really good. Can I ask you a question though? - Yeah. - Can I see your hands? - Why, what are looking for? - I want to see if you have
open sores on your hands. - No (laughing). - He has open sores all over his hands. - What are these little
sprinkles made out of? - So those are Flamin' Hot sprinkles. We took the same thing as the icing and then added a ton more
Flamin' Hot seasoning to them. So it's gonna be like little concentrated bites of Flamin' Hot. - I don't always compliment you, but this is worthy of a Josh compliment. Man you even put the holes in it. - Yeah, everything about it
is quintessentially Pop-Tart, and like you get all the
Flamin' Hot Cheeto-ness. It's not just a spicy Pop-Tart, but it's Flamin' Hot Cheeto. 'Cause you're getting the
cheddar, you're getting the onion, you're getting the garlic. You can literally smell it
in the back of your pallet, but it's with all this fruit and you're not super mad about it. - How do you smell in
the back of your pallet? (sniffing) - [Josh] And it almost toasted. (laughing) we almost got it. - All right, so that part
didn't really hold it (laughs). - Can we take back that Josh compliment? - Ow. So would you guys say that
these snacks (mumbles). Would you guys (laughs). Would you guys say (mumbles). (laughing) - I think what you're trying to say is did these snacks smash? - Yes - They smashed. - Boom. Kevin and Matt thank you so
much for putting your bowels on the line to be a
part of this taste test. You are the real heroes here. - My stomach hurts already. - And thank you for watching. If you want to watch even
more content like this subscribe to the Mythical YouTube Channel. Let me know in the comments
what snacks you want to see smashed next time. See you later. I've never OD'd on any food, but I did eat so many fire cracker shrimp at a Hokkaido seafood buffet, that I ended up having violent
diarrhea in a bathroom stall and then I actually threw up into my pants that were around my ankles, at the same time and then I
just had to wipe everything down with a paper towel and then I
kinda just pulled up my pants and scuttled out. And had to call my friends
to pay the bill for me, 'cause I had a lot to take care of. Is that the answer you wanted? (laughs) They were really good shrimp (laughs).",13:30
cciw0MyXMyI,The Try Guys,"Entertainment,Blog",The Try Guys Test High Driving,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cciw0MyXMyI,3 years ago,13M views,"Entertainment,Blog","(upbeat jazzy music) - Over the course of this series, we are going to drive under
the influence four times. - We're gettin' drunk,
we're getting stoned, we're gettin' sleepy, and
we're gonna be textin'. - In this video, we're gonna drive while high. - Oh, no. - We've set up a closed course
that is a traffic simulation. -Yesterday, we drove the course sober as a control for our experiment. - I'm actually really curious to see if we can push
this to the limit today, and find out, what is the threshold for stoned driving? - I'm worried about how
I'm going to act today. I'm more worried about
how Ned is going to act. - I don't do like drug stuff. Really not at all. (Try Guys talking belligerently) (car engine starts) (liquid bubbling)
(engine racing) (whistle) (guitar music) - Driving high. We're in this place where, in California, and a lot of states, you can buy marijuana legally.
- [All] Yeah. - You just walk in and buy it? - It's a legal thing now. Because it's a new legalized thing, we don't know how it effects
you when you're driving. - The few times that I've done it, I've had a wide variety of reactions. Ow! Ow! Ow! Fuck! - Don't drop the fire in your hand. - I've probably smoked like
five times total in my life. And four of those times were with Keith. - I-I-I've smoked some weed before. It's legal. I'm an adult. - I like smoking weed. I think it's nice. It's relaxing. There are different types of getting high. - I don't actually partake
in marijuana very often. (coughing) It's just not something I do. Maybe because I'm drinking so much. - And, why is it okay to get on camera and say, yeah, I can
drink a 12 pack of beer, but if you get on camera and say that you'll smoke a joint, suddenly, you're a villain. It's been proven that it's safer. - So, we're just learning now, more about driving while high on marijuana because there hasn't been a
lot of really good research. - Okay, I'm gonna put it in park. Let's assess the situation. - So, In the state of California, it's legal to use recreational marijuana. However, it's not legal to
drive after consuming cannabis, because the obvious dangers of possibly being involved
in a traffic collision. - Oh!
- Wow. - Oh my god, is it okay?
- No. - Did I kill it? - I just don't do it. I don't like doing it. I shouldn't do it, clearly. But, today, we're gonna do it, man. (mid tempo music) - [Zach Modulated Voiceover]
You guys watch Riverdale? - [Eugene Modulated Voiceover] You know, I saw the first episode in an airplane, and I landed right as the two
characters were in the closet. I'm like, what the hell, man. - You gotta get it inside of yourself. - [Try Guys Repeat] You gotta
get it inside of yourself. - You gotta take a deep
look inside of yourself. - How do we know when we're high? - I'm already a little high. - Really?
- Yeah. - Do you guys have ants at your house? - Pretty, pretty princess. - [Try Guys Repeat]
Pretty, pretty princess. - Keith, you ever thought about how this is just your car that we're gonna-- (giggles) - Yeah, have I ever thought about it? Yeah, I've thought about it. - It's clearly a cat
on top of a second cat. Look there's the two tails. - Oh, okay. - [Zach] Are they facing out?
- [Eugene] No. - [Zach] Are they tummy-to-tummy? - Alright. Well, we're high now. (giggles) - Snack time? - We have these cannabinoid
receptors in our brain. Throughout our brain. Throughout our central nervous system, where marijuana activates, but we still don't really understand exactly how that happens
and how it impairs judgment. - Where does all this
orange stuff come from? - I have the worst cotton-mouth
I think I've ever had. - The old saying, if you
have cotton in your mouth, (laughing) Jesus is trying to give you kisses. - What? (laughing) - What? What are you talking about? - [Eugene] It's a saying from the south. - I would let Jesus kiss me. - Doritos. Doritos. Doritos. Doritos. - [All Try Guys] Doritos. (laughing) - I think the Try Guys are
going to be interesting. We're gonna be able to see
the differences between driving on marijuana
versus driving on alcohol. In general, I think it's
unsafe to do either. I really wish them good luck. - Police car. (siren wails) - If you get pulled over, stoned, how do they prove it? - There's no weed breathalyzer. There's no way to know. - We do have drug recognition experts. There are many indicators that we look at to determine what types of drugs they may be under the influence of. - [Officer Jenny] Good morning, sir. - Police. - Good afternoon, sir. - Good afternoon, Officer Jenny. (laughing) - Don't make up things. Don't start with lies. - How are you doing today? - Feeling good. How are you? - How good you feelin'? - How are you? - When you stop them, we look to see how their
reacting to our questions. - Do you have any substances
in your system today? - How should I answer that? - She seems nice. - You answer. - I haven't thought about that. Yes, ma'am. - No, no ma'am. - No. None? - No. Yes. (giggling)
- Yeah. Alright, well, let's see
how you're doing then. - You were up there with us. You saw us smoking a lot of weed, Rachel. - Sure did. - We look at their face. We look at their eyes. We look in the manner of
which they're speaking. As such as marijuana, they
may be somewhat reserved. Their eyes may be red. Slow to react. A person is gonna walk the line, heel-to-toe, heel-to-toe, while maintaining their
hands close to their body. - And a four, five. - I feel like I'm in the Greatest Showman. - [Ned] Five, six. - [Eugene] Seven.
- [Ned] Wow. - Eight, nine. Bossy. Yeah. - Sassy. Alright. - Also, there is a finger-to-nose. Everybody knows where their nose is. They shouldn't have a
problem touching their nose. - [Female Officer] Right.
- Boom. - [Female Officer] Left. Left. Right. (laughing) - But at the end, the common factor is that we're gonna make
a decision if the person is gonna be deemed to be under the influence of drugs or not. - Alright, thank you very much. Thank you so much. I'm getting in the car. - Yay. We have set up 538 cones in
a complicated, closed course that is a traffic simulation, designed to challenge the driver. No, oh no. - I'm trying to phrase it as like, me and my buddies, we wanted
to get some Taco Bell. This is just how we get to Taco Bell. There's potholes, there's intersections, there's school zones. Oh no, dead end. How are we gonna get out of it? It's perfect. Then, we have to parallel
park when we get back home. It's just a trip to Taco Bell. - Driving while stoned. Yes, I have done that. - I've been a little high
and I've driven a few blocks. It's fine, I feel like it's fine. - We do know that
driving on any substance, including marijuana, is
dangerous, and is not recommended. - Yeah, we're good. Okay, here we go, alright guys. - I just smoked a lot of
weed and now I'm gonna drive. This is not safe. Oh, you guys got snacks. - Yeah. (chips crunching) - I can do this. I feel like I can do this. - Click it, click it, click it, click it. - [Try Guys] We're clicked. - Let's go. - Alright. Oh, I went two, one too many. - You got this, Zach. - How do you feel, Keith? - I feel a little stoned. Whoa, what's going on with this road? Why is it all stupid? - Wow, oh wow. Oh wow. - You're doing great. You're doing great. - What fucking Doctor Seuss shit is this? - [Eugene] Oh no. - [Keith] You're crushing it, bro. - Some people actually,
who are high on marijuana, go to the opposite extreme. - [Ned] Easy. Too fast. Too fast. Oh, my god. - [Keith] You gotta keep driving, Ned. You can't stop in the road. - So bad. - When they smoke and
they get behind the wheel, they want to be extra careful. They'll go extra slowly, or they'll give themselves room behind the car in front of them. - That is common, to
see people drive slow, because they're trying
to be over cautious. They know they've been
consuming marijuana. - It also, can impair coordination. (sounds of dismay) - No. No. No. No. No. The few times I've smoked weed, I've turned into a crazy person. - [Eugene] What are we driving over? - I think. I think it was a cone. (car honks)
(squealing) - So, I have less
experience with smoking pot. Lord only knows what's gonna happen today. This is my Keith impression. So, Keith touches every car. (singing) The American gymnasts are always so sweet. Like, figure skaters do. They always paint Russian figure skaters as if they're really cold,
but I think eight years ago. - What are you talking about? - I'm telling you who I am. I said, who are you? And, I was like, Aliya Mustafina, the crown jewel of Russian gymnastics. One time when I got
high, I stripped naked, I stole my friends dog, I climbed up a tree, and proclaimed myself the wolf king. That was one time. - California weed, it fucks ya up. - Pass a little nana to your friends. - Man, you gotta go. - [Zach] It's bite, bite, pass. What am I like when I'm high? - [Try Guys] Oh!
- What? - We got something. Didn't you hear that thump? We thumped something. - What are you taking about? I'm giggly. (giggling) I certainly get paranoid when I'm high. - [Keith] What's happening with you? - [Zach] I think I was
about to hit something. - For some people, marijuana
can definitely affect their perception of time. (laughing) (chattering) Sometimes for some
people, high on marijuana, time can slow down. Again, if you're driving and you're not really sure the time, that can affect your coordination. Your ability to judge how far something is from something else and,
again, can be quite dangerous. - Jesus! - [Keith] Oh my god. Whoa, who's that? - It's Miles Bonsignore. (laughing) - Go, Ned, you gotta go! - Okay, okay. (singing) I feel like we were going too fast. - Oh, what the fart? - Three way hazard. (muffled chattering) - Oh my goodness, time to back that up. (laughing) - [Ned] Back it up. - Can you read? Can you actually read, Zach? - Yeah, I can read. - Prove to the audience
that you know how to read. - What's it say?
- What's it say? Closed. Don't come this way. - That's not what is says. What does it actually say? Stop being funny. (laughing) - You told him! You told him, Keith.
(laughing) - Well, if someone is high on marijuana, they may not be able to
calculate depth perception. - I don't have a backup camera. - Can you see out the back window? - It was high anxiety while driving. I was very concerned about everything. A little over concerned
probably, at times. - [Ned] Oh, please be careful, Keith. - Also, tough visibility with
three big heads in the back. - [Try Guys] Oh. (laughing) - Have I not been talking
about how people look sexy when they're backing up? Look at this.
- [Keith] You look pretty hot. How do I look.
- [Ned] Pretty hot. - [Keith] Oh, you look good. You're doing such a good job. (mumbling) - Marijuana, depending on
the patients experience with marijuana can also impair judgment. (car horn honking) - [Try Guys] Whoa! Whoa!
Oh. - Okay, hold on. We're gonna go back to where we started. - [Try Guys] Zach. Zach.
Oh my god. (laughing) - [Keith] You can't do that. - You looked at me and told me, oh shit, I'm getting too close. - Once I started to realize I was starting to knock over cones, I got so freaked out that, what if I was actually on a road? I would be so screwed. - You got this man. - Guys, I'm freaking out. - [Zach] Yeah, that's clear. - I made so many mistakes. This is horrible. - Some indicators that
tell us that the person is not driving safely: Speeding or such as, running red lights. - I feel great. I feel great. I feel fantastic. I'm trying to take you somewhere fun. - What?
- So don't critique. (laughing) - What does that mean? (laughing and whooping) - [Eugene] I'm taking you to the river. - This is that part of
San Francisco, right? - [Eugene] Lombard Street. - Lombard James. - We do know that it
decreases our inhibitions. We're more likely, again,
to make some decisions we may not make, when we're sober. - I'm gonna try it. - Speeding or weaving
tell us that the person is not driving safely
or under the influence of some type of substance. (screaming) (car horn honks)
- We got this. We got this. (car horn honking) - [Ned] Maybe you can get it. - [Keith] No, I don't think so. Maybe you can get it. - I could have done it. - No, you couldn't have.
- {Eugene] No. - Driving high is extremely dangerous because they contribute
to traffic collisions where people are injured
or lose their lives. - Now, I've been through
this part of town before. (laughing) It always sucks. There's just so many people parked on it. - Especially in figure skating. I feel like it's always the young American girl getting gold. I feel like other countries
have worked really hard too. (laughing)
Why is no one-- - You're gonna be impossible to edit. You're so high.
- [Try Guys] Oh no. - Zach, you just hit the parking garage. - You told me to read. (screaming) (collision clamor) - [Eugene] Hit the giant briefcase. Not my briefcase! (intense music) Yeah, Keith. - [Keith] Wow. - It also can slow reflexes down. (dramatic music) - [Keith] Whoa! Oh!
- [Zach] Oh! (dog barking) I almost hit that skateboard and dog. (laughing) - [Zach] Oh, boy. - Watch out it's that stupid fucking dog. (screaming) (laughing) - I think that there's
other deserving athletes. (screaming) - [Keith] Is it okay? - Did I... Did I kill it?
- [Keith] Oh, no. (yelling) - Are you serious? Why is the crew-- - No. - No!
- No. - No.
- No! - Oh no, he's okay. - [Ned] Oh god, no!
- He's okay. He's okay. - What is he doing on that skateboard? - He had so much more to give. - Did I kill it? Could someone tell me
how hard I hit the dog? Take my dog. - Why was he skateboarding
so late at night? He should know better. - [Eugene] I don't care anymore. I hit a dog. - [Keith] Eugene, no. - I hit a dog. - [Keith] Just pull forward. - No, I hit a dog. I hit a dog. (car honks) I'm sad. - [Keith] Oh no. - Was it a tap, or did I break it's neck? - For most of that, I
thought I did it right. - [Keith] You are crushing this. - [Eugene] Oh, perfect. - I guess the thing that I forgot, is you just make stupid mistakes. - [Keith] Don't go too far back. - [Eugene] Don't go.
Stop, stop, you're good. You're good
Yeah. - I can't see! I'm driving blind. (car honks) That's good enough. Let's get inside, guys.
(clapping) (dramatic music) - Oh man. Wow, I got pretty high. - Try Guys have never been the High Guys, but that was a first. - I though that I would be perfect. I knocked over a wall. (laughing) If that were my garage wall, I'd be looking at thousands
of dollars of damage. - My mental state was highly anxious. Then, when I had to do the reverse, I was just so confused. I screwed it all up.
I screwed it all up. You temporarily forget
which way your wheel is supposed to go when
you're driving in reverse. I think everybody kind of
experiences that at some time, when they're first driving. Like, wait do I-- It was like I was
experiencing that over again. - Certainly didn't have
confidence to drive while high. I thought it was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea. I knew I didn't want to be outside. - We do think that marijuana can be a little bit safer than alcohol. There have been fewer crashes reported with someone high on marijuana, than with alcohol. - I personally think that
drunk driving is worse than stoned driving. It doesn't mean that
stoned driving is good. - The four of us were very
different types of high. I was really fixated on things. I think I was talking about Russia a lot. - I don't want the message to be, Keith was high and was able to do it, because Ned was high, and he wasn't. You don't know how it will affect you. It's best to just err
on the side of caution. - Your perception of how you drive, under these influences is not the reality. It just isn't. - We're still at the infancy
of understanding how much marijuana has to be in
you blood to be determined to be impaired while driving. It gets very confusing, because if someone is a
chronic marijuana user, those levels may be very high, but they may not actually be impaired. They may be as sober as the next person. We still need to find better tools to determine if someone is impaired while using marijuana while driving. - After this experience,
I would never drive high. All of my reaction times were way slower, and my obsessive mind was focusing on everything besides the road. - We got two more videos. Come back next week and
we are going to drive while wildly sleep deprived. Then, we're going to drive while texting. (upbeat music) (laughing) - Sorry, we made our banana peels kiss. (laughing)",16:56

RtWbpyjJqrU,SmarterEveryDay,Science,Slow Motion Flipping Cat Physics | Smarter Every Day 58,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtWbpyjJqrU,9 years ago,10M views,Science,"Hey it's me Destin welcome back to Smarter Every Day. 
So you've probably observed that cats almost always land on their feet. 
Today's question is why. Like most simple questions there's a very complex answer. For instance let me re-word this question. How does a cat go from feet up to feet down in a falling reference frame without violating the conservation of angular momentum. Now I've studied free falling bodies, my own in fact, in several different environments and once I get my angular rotation started in one direction, I can't stop it. Today, we're gonna use a high speed camera, we're not gonna use Alley, cause this is my daughter's cat, I don't want to hurt it. We're gonna use a stunt cat. Let me introduce you to Gigi the stunt cat. [music] I'll just flip the video vertical, and then motion track the cat. It's just gonna take a lot more effort in post. We're gonna try to do it in a way that doesn't make anybody mad. That's pretty hard to do. You've gotta drop a cat. Ready Gigi? Good. Checking out the high speed data there Gigi? [music]    OK the first thing a cat does when it's falling is try to figure out which way is up. It does this either with a gyro in the ear, or with it's eyes. 3..2.. Ready to talk cat physics? Alright, so check out this footage I captured with the Phantom Miro while Gigi goes to get a drink of water. So here's what's interesting about this to me. If you'll notice at the beginning of the drop the cat is not rotating. Half way through the drop the cat is rotating, and then at the very end Gigi somehow stops rotating. Newton's first law says that an object at rest will stay at rest unless acted on by an external force. I see no external forces on this cat. So what's happening here? It's not making sense to me. OK so in order to really get the right data, we're gonna have to drop her 90 degrees out of phase. Ready girl? This time watch her tail. 3.. 2.. 1.. [music]      OK so you think you've figured it out? Check this out. You probably noticed that when the cat was falling, her tail was rotating in the direction opposite of where her body was rotating. What's interesting about that is that that's not how it works. In fact even Bobtail cats can do this. It's called the cat righting reflex. I'll prove it to you. I came across some video from the 60s when the air force was researching micro gravity for future astronauts. Turns out they took some cats up on parabolic flights. He tries to rotate his tail to flip over but it doesn't work. He just ends up nutating wildly. Then he does something interesting. He takes his back and he bends it, and when he bends his back and then creates motion, something interesting happens. Aah. Now we're getting somewhere. So let me show you one more cat flip with the Miro and we'll figure this out. OK the arched back ends up being pretty important. What he does is he divides his body up into two separate rotational axes that are tilted from one another. When he's released he pulls his front paws in and does the ice skater trick. He decreases his moment of inertia in the front so he can spin fast up there, but in the back he pushes his legs away from him, increasing his moment of inertia, so a really large twist in the front equals a really small twist in the back in the opposite direction and the torques equal out. So as soon as he gets his front paws in under him, all he has to do is extend those legs back out to increase that moment of intertia and stop the front twist, and extend his back  legs along that rear axis. That allows him to twist those around really fast, and then all he has to do is pull them back in under his body and then extend all four legs and brace for impact. [music]      So thank you for your attention. I hope you learned something pretty cool about cats. If you don't mind..
[Angry meowing] Ooh! OK OK I'm done! If you would, go check out your other cat videos after trying to catch Gigi. Wooh! A little too rowdy. If you'd like to, click Gigi the cat to subscribe, we'd appreciate it. I hope you had a good one. And aah Get the ball! You gotta catch her first. I got it, you want it? Look... Very cool cat. She let us drop her hundreds of times. Or, you know, maybe just 5. Want your ball? Go get it! Click her if you want to subscribe, but right now we're playing fetch. Ready? Go get it! I'm Destin. You're getting Smarter Every Day. Have a good one. [Whispered] There you go. You earned it.  Let me explain why cats are wizards at physics. First of all they have physiology working for them. They have no working clavicle like I do, and secondly they have very flexible back bones. The talent needs a break. 30 centimeters or higher. Anything below that is unsafe. Not that we condone dropping cats. C'mere! C'mere.. There you go. Go get in the catapult. 3.. 2.. 1.. Oh man. [ Captions by Andrew Jackson ]

TwNPKb9ol8Y,LEMMiNO,Informative,Top 10 Facts - Unsolved Mysteries [Part 1],1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwNPKb9ol8Y,7 years ago,5.7M views,Informative,"A book named The Secret - A Treasure Hunt was published in America in 1982. It contained 12 paintings and 12 verses. The book explained that these were clues to find 12 hidden treasures across the US. The key to finding the treasures was to match one of the paintings to one of the verses, then solve the riddle to reveal the location and start digging. Since the publication of the book over 30 years ago now, only 2 of the 12 treasures have been found. The first was located in Chicago and was discovered in 1984. The second was found in Cleveland in 2004. The remaining 10 are still out there waiting to be found. All you have to do is solve the riddles. You can't really make a video about unsolved mysteries without covering some of the greatest mysteries of them all: UFOs. One of the most well documented or at least observed cases is the phenomenon called Hessdalen Lights in Norway. ""Oh my God!"" ""I'm recording it! I have it on tape!"" ""I have it here!"" ""Oh my!"" The seemingly floating lights in the sky have been observed by hundreds of people, and sightings have been reported since at least the early 19th century. Theories include ionized dust, ball lightning, combustible particles, and, of course, aliens. Shelly Miscavige is, or maybe was, the wife of Scientology leader David Miscavige. For decades, Shelly has been a sort of first lady of Scientology, always by David's side or in virtually every meeting, every trip, every photo op. Sometime in 2007, she, for unknown reasons, decided to carry out a few executive decisions without David's okay. In August that year, after attending her father's funeral, she vanished without a trace. The Church of Scientology denies that she's missing and states that she's working for the church out of the public eye, though they refused to reveal her current location to both the public and her close friends. Former members have said that when they asked about her, their questions were quickly ignored or otherwise avoided. A missing person's report was filed in 2013, but it was quickly closed and classified as 'unfounded'. Shelly Miscavige haven't been seen or heard of for over 7 years now. In 1949, geologist Vadim Kolpakov set off on an expedition to Siberia. While wandering through the wilderness, he found something he could not explain: an enormous crater the size of a 25-story building, now known as the Patomskiy Crater. Up close it looked like a volcano, but there haven't been any known volcanoes in the area for at least a few million years and later research reveals that the crater was formed only around 300 years ago. It's also been speculated to be other things such as a meteorite, a deep gas breakout, the obligatory alien or crashed UFO theory, and the list goes on. What or who could have given rise to the crater has yet to be discovered. The Voynich manuscript. It's believed to be from the early 15th century and was purchased in 1912 by a man named Wilfrid Michael Voynich. It's a codex consisting of around 240 pages handwritten in a language which, after the countless attempts, no one has been able to decipher. This has led many to speculate about its origin, author, and the meaning of its content. The text uses an alphabet of between 20 to 30 letters, but what's strange is that they are practically no words with fewer than two letters or more than ten. The whole text seemed to be quite repetitive, as well, with some words appearing up to three times in a row and some letters being found in the majority of the words throughout. This, along with other aspects that makes it quite different from other European languages, has led many to believe it might actually just be nonsense. Then again, why would someone go through the trouble of writing a whole 240 pages, including these quite elaborate graphics, if it doesn't actually mean anything? In 1900, only living souls on this small Scottish island were three lighthouse keepers named Thomas Marshall, James Ducat, and William MacArthur. The day after Christmas, a supply ship arrived at the island, but to the crew's surprise there were no one at the dock waiting for them. They tried blowing the ship's horn and sent up a flare, but there were still no activity on the island. They eventually went to investigate. As they climbed the stairs leading up to the lighthouse, they noticed that two of the three waterproof jackets usually kept in the hall were missing. Reaching the kitchen, they found the remains of a meal and a chair laying on the floor as if someone had left in a hurry. But, most importantly, the lighthouse keepers were nowhere to be found. A further investigation also revelaed the strange final entries in the lighthouse log. On the 12th of December, Thomas Marshall wrote of extreme winds worse than anything he had experienced before. He also noted that James Ducat, the principal keeper, had been very quiet and that the third assistant William MacArthur had been crying. What's strange about the final remark was that William MacArthur was a seasoned mariner and was known on the Scottish mainland as a real, tough guy. Why would he be crying about a storm? Log entries on the 13th of December stated that the storm was still raging and that they had all been praying, but why would these experienced lighthouse keepers inside a brand new lighthouse be praying for a storm to stop? They should have been perfectly safe, and they should, by all means, have known that. But, even more peculiar is that there were no reported storms in the area during this time period. In fact, the weather was calm. The final log entry was made on the 15th. It simply reads: ""Storm ended, sea calm. God is over all."" The most accepted theory is that all three men were somehow swallowed by the sea, never to be seen again. In 1970, a group of hikers outside of Bergen, Norway suddenly came upon the shard naked corpse of a woman in the middle of Isdalen Valley. The body was surrounded by sleeping pills, bottles of liquor, an almost incinerated passport, and, for some reason, her fingerprints had been sanded off. She was later linked to a pair of suitcases found at the train station, but all the labels in her clothes had been removed. They also found five hundred German marks and a diary with coded entries. It was eventually discovered that the woman had traveled throughout Europe using different fake names, and several witnesses reported that she had used different wigs, changed hotel frequently and spoke multiple languages. The woman's identity remains unknown, but it's generally presumed that the Isdal woman must have been some sort of spy. UVB-76, also known as the buzzer, is a shortwave radio station that broadcast a short monotonous buzz tone repeating at the rate of approximately 25 tones per minute 24 hours a day It's been active since at least 1982, when the first reports were made of a station on this frequency, and on rare occasions the buzzer signal is interrupted by a coded voice transmission in Russian. Its origin has also been traced to Russia, but its actual purpose remains a mystery. The most reasonable theory is that the station is used for some kind of military purpose, and occasionally, distant conversations and other background noises have been heard behind a buzzer. And, keep in mind, it takes a lot of power to constantly transmit the signal, especially when it's been running for over thirty years. So, there must be a very good reason why the sound is so important that it warrants this kind of investment. In the 1880s, the body of a young woman was found floating in a river in Paris. Police quickly pulled the body out of the water and sent it to the coroner. When the coroner received it, he, for some reason, decided to make a plaster mold out of her face. Random customers at the mold shop took notice of the piece, and soon copies of the anonymous dead girl's face were being mass-produced. The campus became a fashionable the morbid fixture and the mass quickly spread across Europe. Fast forward a couple of decades, and a Norwegian toymaker decides to create the world's first CPR test dummy. Guess what face he uses as a mold for the dummy. yeah because you know why the fuck not Every single one of those CPR dummies manufactured since has had her face, which means that if you ever had to take CPR training, you have wrapped your lips around the mouth of a 130 year old dead girl, who, by the way, was no more than 16 years old when she died. To this day, nobody has any idea who she was. Since 2012, there have been a complex online puzzle game starting every January, which is hosted by someone who calls themselves 3-3-0-1. The complex puzzles draws on elements of cryptography, mathematics, literature, hidden messages, data security, and philosophy. Physical clues appear in places as diverse as the US, Poland, Spain, Australia and Korea. 3301 claims that its puzzles attempts define intelligent individuals, but they don't say why. Many believe these nearly impossible hustles are a secret recruitment tool for organizations like CIA or NSA, but no company or individual has so far taken credit or try to monetize it. What makes it even more mysterious though is that no one who solved the puzzles completely have ever come forward. On the 6th of January this year, the 3rd annual game began with this message released as an image using a seemingly random and anonymous Twitter account. And, by the way, this year's game is still ongoing. You",12:09
WvSjrHzKd8E,Donut Media,Automobile,"$450 Brakes vs $4,500 Brakes | HiLow",1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvSjrHzKd8E,2 years ago,5.5M views,Automobile,"(engine revving) - [Man] Oh, you got it,
keep going, keep going! - $450 break upgrade kit-- - Versus $4,400 Big Brake Kit. - Does more expensive mean more better? - Let's find out. I sure hope so. (laughing) (exciting music) - Hey, guys, we made a
show called Car Wars. The Donut gang going against some of your favorite
YouTubers, like ChrisFix. Loser had to eat a very spicy chip. Very spicy but very fun to watch. The hardest challenge was
the VR third-person driving. I almost threw up 'cause
I got motion sickness. (gags)
(laughs) (beep)
We bought two almost identical Nissan 350Zs and we've been modifying
them to be fun daily drivers that you can take to the track. - My Z gets a ton of
really expensive parts and Nolan's car gets
a bunch of cheap ones. - We're gonna test them side by side and see which components are worth spending your hard-earned money on. - So far we've installed coilovers and new wheel and tire combos
on our twin 350Zs, and today, we're movin' onto the brakes. We wanna see what kinda results we can get from a really basic but
still good brake upgrade versus a full monty, daddy I'm
going into credit card debt for this brake kit brake kit. Look how much bigger
my pads are than yours. - And these are my front pads. Size comparison. That's pretty enormous. The Big Brake Kit doesn't necessarily mean more braking power, it's
just that you'll be able to do harder braking for longer because the heat is being distributed over a larger area than mine. With these tiny little guys, I think I'm gonna have some
pretty gnarly brake fade after stepping on 'em a lot, many times, a lot of many times. - Also look how much bigger the vents are on the Wilwood kit versus Nolan's. A lot more air's gonna pass through those and it's gonna cool the
brakes a lot better. We're just fightin' heat and
we are gonna come out on top. - Honestly, I think his baller-ass setup is gonna blow mine away. - This is honestly the
best day of my life. - No contest which is better. (laughing) - You never know! I mean, yeah! Looks like mine is almost
certainly 1,000% better, but let's just wait and
see if the Wilwood kit is really so much better that it's worth those
thousands of dollars. (hiphop music) Brakes. - Big or small? - That is the question. - Today we have the answer.
- We're gonna find out. (beep) - [Narrator] When
upgrading your brake kit, there are a handful of different pieces you can opt to replace. Rotors, pads, calipers,
brake lines, and brake fluid. On high car, we're
swappin' out all of those. In the low car we'll do the
same, except for calipers. Because new calipers are just
too dang expensive for Nolan and his poor team. - And all that together
should make our brakes firmer and more consistent at the track. Upgraded rotors can help dissipate heat with more effective venting, added slots, and/or increased surface area. - Know what I mean?
- Power tools, baby! - Me, I'm just a car boy. (tool buzzing) (laughs) (tool buzzing) - You got what, 12 bolts here? - I can't keep track of that
in my head so as we torque 'em we'll mark 'em and then well,
once they're all marked, they're all torqued. My brake rotor won't fit with
this dust shield on there. To get it off we can either
take the whole hub off or do some custom engineering. (tools buzzing) - The other part of being bigger is that a larger friction ring allows you to run a larger pad. - [James] Upgraded pads can be made with more heat-tolerant materials, and bigger pads also dissipate heat easier with their larger surface area. But in order to have bigger
pads, you need bigger calipers. - It needs force all across it. This is a single-piston caliper. If you're pushing on the back
of this pad with one piston, you don't have any force on the sides, so you need a big circle? No, you can't do that! So you do a few little circles. So this has pistons on both sides, inside and behind that pad, and
since this is a fixed rotor, without the sliding piece this
thing doesn't flex at all, so you get a really firm,
really consistent brake pedal. - Got the new Wildwood 10. Hold on, hello? What's up, babe? I'm at the shop. Yeah, the boys are here. Yeah, we're kickin' it,
yeah we're havin' fun! Yeah we're building the HiLow Zs. Oh.
(laughs) Ooh, maybe. Well, I think we can arrange that. (laughs) Yeah, I'll be home late. (kisses) (upbeat music) - With all this other stuff we also replaced the brake lines, that's usually a part
of the Big Brake Kit. Because stock lines are
often this soft and durable and flexible rubber, which
is great for daily driving and it's great for longevity, but it's not great for performance. Over time these can bulge, especially with really
high, heavy braking, and that gives you a squish in your pedal where you shouldn't have one. So to correct that, most Big Brake Kits, including this Wilwood kit,
come with stainless steel lines. - Once you got your other line in place, you break lose the OEM hard line with the line wrench right here, and then as quickly as possible you're gonna shove it back on. So the reason I leave
the old line in there is because it's good to
have reference points. If this line actually goes on the front, it could be too long and
then it could get tangled in some of the working
suspension components, causing some pretty bad
or catastrophic failures. - All right, so we got
all the brakes installed, all the lines on, we're
ready to put our new fluid in and bleed 'em. - [Aaron] So since we
changed the brake lines, you're gonna have to bleed the brakes. - Yeah, 'cause all that
brake fluid you saw drippin' out of the lines has
to be replaced by something and that something is usually air. Every time I press the brake, Aaron's gonna be releasing
air from the system. We do that on all four
corners and then our system will be free of air and
we can drive this thing. - We don't have a bleeder here in the shop so I went ahead and made one out of a can and a clear tube that we
had here just lyin' around. And we're tight. That should be it. How does it feel? - Ah, dude, it's like... It's so solid. It's like, yeah, I shouldn't be jammin'
it like that, should I? (funky music) - [James] After your new pads
and rotors are installed, you're still not done. You have to bed in the brakes. - Oh no. Here we go. - [James] Start at 60 miles an hour and lightly press on your
brakes to get them up to temp. Then get back up to 60 and
stand on the brakes hard down to around 10 miles per. - Oh wow.
- That's better. - Wow, that was really great. - [James] Then get back up to 60 and do it again about 10 times. - Oh hell yeah, dude. - Wow.
- This thing frickin' gets down. - Your brake rotors and
pads are gonna get super hot and smell, just like Nolan. If you don't bed in your brakes, you run the risk of having
uneven pad deposition, which makes your rotors
feel like they're warped. (funk music) Well Nolan's out there
racing S Chassis already. - Makin' friends.
- Makin' friends. He's already part of the JDM community. - This might be another con. Your time. - Yeah, for sure.
- If you wanna go out and hang out with your friends,
maybe don't do big jobs. But hey, we made it through,
we're almost to the other side, we'll be out there
makin' friends very soon. - Yeah, we're gonna be
out there making friends. (hiphop music) - [James] So for the test we
did the same 60 to zero test from the last episode to see
if there's any improvement in stopping distance. - Ah, the brakes feel really good, I'm super impressed with how they work. I mean, who knew it only took
some more aggressive pads and a little better rotors, man? - [James] The main advantage
of upgrading your brakes is not a shorter stopping distance. The main advantage is
resisting brake fade. Brake fade is when your brakes get so hot that they become less effective
or even fail completely. - These brakes are definitely
gonna fade quicker than those. - So their brakes literally
cost 10 times more, but I don't think they're
gonna perform 10 times better. - [James] So we ran the 60 to zero test over and over and over to
put as much heat and stress on our new brakes to see how they affected the stopping distance of each car. (hiphop music) - [Man] Oh, you guys-- (laughs) Oh, you got him, you got him,
you got him, you got him. - They definitely faded but I don't know, these are the worst circumstances
you can throw at brakes and they were pretty damn consistent. So for what we paid,
yeah, you can't really be disappointed.
- Yeah, can't be mad about these. - Look at Nolan's. First. Second. Third. Fourth. Fifth is down here. And then it got kinda
consistent I guess after awhile and well you saw what
happened on the last one. - So with our 60 to zero test
we were able to shave off about five feet from the stock brakes. Which only goes to show
that upgrading your brakes doesn't really make you stop sooner. - Which is why we also
did an endurance test. - One marker, pretty consistently
after about five laps, and then on the sixth lap
Aaron stood on the brake and we stopped like 10
feet past, we're like, oh, it's about to happen. And then a couple laps
later we caught on fire. So when they go, they go. We had to replace the pads
after that torture test 'cause we completely dusted 'em. - High car did not catch on fire. - Nope.
- The brakes barely faded at all. - All right, so does more
expensive mean more better, James? - Absolutely! In this case 1,000%! - So yeah, obviously
the Wilwoods are better. - Way better. - Way better, I mean-- - I wanna acknowledge the aesthetic gains from those big brakes. We had some really cool
wheels on the high car, but seeing those big old
beefy boys behind it, it's like, oh man, that
dude knows what's up. One negative about the Big
Brake Kit is you can't do it and keep your stock wheels. It's just one more thing to consider. So Nolan, which brake kit would you buy? - The Wilwoods are too expensive. They're so, so good, but
that's too much money. Honestly, just the rotors, pads,
and the steel braided lines on my car made a big difference and I don't feel bad about saying that I wouldn't get
the more expensive one. - If this episode gets 10 million views, we'll give Nolan a raise so he can start answering
the would you buy it question a little bit more honestly. (laughs)
- No, this is honestly. I don't have any money to buy this (beep). You don't either, so. - Nolan's like, I wouldn't buy lunch! - So I would go with
the cheaper brake kit, the low kit, if you will. - Solid upgrade, solid, solid upgrade. - The high car is now,
right in this episode, is where the disparity really
starts to become apparent. I mean, they're two different cars now. - Right now we have way
more tire and way more brake than we do power. So you can just drive
the piss outta that thing and stay outta trouble. - And you're fine.
- It's so fun to drive right now. I can't wait 'til we
ruin it with more power. (laughing) More power, baby! In the next episode, we're
gonna see what's the difference. A nice aftermarket LSD, or-- - Or welding your differential together. - If you haven't seen the first
two episodes of this show, make sure you go watch 'em. We did wheels and tires and coilovers. Make sure to tune in every Monday for the next however many Mondays. If you like this, send it to your friend. If you hate it, send it
anyway, it doesn't matter. Follow Donut @donutmedia for
all that sweet, sweet BTS and the dankest memes

rXAeb7Pmzjs,Incognito Mode,"Blog,Comedy",KONY Q&A,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXAeb7Pmzjs,3 years ago,2.4M views,"Blog,Comedy","[Music] that's just a jump into it how's Connie doing these days it seems likely that if he's not captured in the next few years he'll be dead anyway it was reported a few years ago that he has type 2 diabetes and that's a fairly progressive disease you know it's hard to get dialysis or large stocks of insulin in the jungle but for now he's roaming around in the jungle with about a hundred troops and and hopefully he's dead sooner than later those tattoos were they real as far as I can tell they're all real I only put a few of them in the video that were a couple elders that were a bit more dubious so I left them out for example this one which is like the upside-down triangle which represents the Fourth Estate it was like the next campaign represented equality or something his Connie actually as bad as they say I feel like everything so i paralyzed in the media these days so it's kind of hard to find words that describe quite how evil this guy is but unequivocally yes kills kids mutilate skids amputates their arms and legs kills him for sport kills them to send messages you know it makes them kill one another if I was living there by any means necessary I'd be getting the [ __ ] out why did Jason have the breakdown these things I think are always multi-factor so first is he had an underlying mental illness the second is that he was very rundown so operating on very little sleep very high pressure situations going from in to to interview flying across the country apparently he was also very dehydrated so not taking care of himself simple maintenances the third is that he had a very bright spotlight on him all of a sudden he was the face of the most viral video to date and he was recognized in places he was criticized as well as praised wherever he went and he just wasn't prepared for it the fifth is that I think he felt a very strong responsibility I think he's and see a guy I think it really did want to help people in Africa that's it that that seems as far as I can tell it's that really is his main goal and so I think he felt an enormous pressure when suddenly everyone went oh he's the guy who's gonna fix Africa okay well here's all the resources you need and we're gonna fulfill all the criteria that you've set out you just have to deliver a safe Africa now it's like oh hey man this like you know kids having their pieces of their face cut off and stuffing and he's the one who's gonna have to fix it and like I am I can see I can see how that would be a very heavy weight to have on your shoulders people said that he was on drugs that's not true at least I don't I don't think that's true they'll test you for that sort of stuff when you get checked into a mental hospital isn't interviews dude with Oprah or he says that no drugs were you on drugs at all at the time zero drugs if I saw that video though and it wasn't me I'd like that person absolutely you I mean oh yeah I don't care what they say yeah he tends to be feeling matter-of-fact about these things he also wasn't jacking it I felt like I had to address that in the video you know Casey nice step city was South Park featured it and there's a large part in one of the episodes it seems like thousands and thousands of people were saying that he was jacking it into the streets but there is absolutely no corroboration from it there were no witnesses who said that he was jacking it there were no police who said that he was jacking it the footage doesn't show him jacking it and so it just seems to have been plucked from thin air and it's become part of the story now and it's it's almost impossible to refute it is what it is I read this very long interview I can't remember where it was published and it talks about the scope of the delusions and I cut the spit out for the sake of brevity but he says at one point he called his maid up and he says you got to come to the house and he comes over NACS hey man we have to rearrange all the books on my bookshelf in chronological order so that we can determine what humanity should do next like crazy delusions of grandeur so this is like a full-on mental break and you know he spent a month in a mental hospital and uh I don't know I it seems to me like if you're gonna feel pity for anyone it's someone who has a mental breakdown and spends a month in a mental hospital you know and anyway well the last thing to mention is also over pretty soon after I had made that video Jason Russell actually appeared in an interview with the BBC and he talked about his mental breakdown and it's a really good interview it goes for about 30 minutes I'll provide a link and it basically confirms a lot of things in the video they don't touch on the same exact points but it's a very good synopsis of what happened and Jason you know goes goes through it in his own words and it's worth a listen what the [ __ ] is up with that musical I want to scratch my eyes okay so that music video was part of a campaign called the global night commute this is back in 2006 and the idea of ironmen global night commute is that we're going to sleep out on the streets for a night to understand and have empathy for these kids that are having to do the same in rural Uganda accompanying it was this video why was it like this well I think in 2006 high school music who was popular I think they wanted to put something on their show real I think they enjoyed musicals and they saw this is the best way of relating to the kids so I want to show the thing in full it's on the Creative Commons license so you can do whatever you want with it the footage I showed on the main channel video is about 30 seconds of a seven-minute video so I'll understand if you want to opt out here's a timestamp so you can just skip it if you just cannot take it anymore so the they're pretending like I've just screened a video to a high school audience right move it was really good inside and all but what are we supposed to do about it it's a really good investment on a 29 we're having this thing called a glowing and we're asking you and all you guys to do something maybe to use you're a little down now that seems like a kid you in the decorator no offense but what do you know about it sounds great so that you know the acting is their own sort of devil's advocate crazy we know but and we don't know much anyway this is why I said he's a typical Californian dude because I listen to this guy's accent I know it's a you know but and we don't know much we've never done this before but we know that what America does gets noticed and what the people in America do can't be ignored come on guys get real hundreds before you have tried to end Wars what makes you so different why doesn't he go any government to shoot that just that is a legitimate question if you can hear in the background I hope this is loud enough he goes someone in the background helps we're sleeping out on the streets is it gonna be good puffs there we gotta do something right what can we do to be responded like spectacle something huge big flashy that's what we need to do is bring it okay you know let's give them what they want let's do what we always do do dance yeah so I skipped below this cuz it has a real long buildup [Music] you know is that I feel like they're all skeptical but then by the end he's even got the principal dad's I looked at giant now [Music] [Music] [Music] I've had this song in my head I tried so hard to get this shirt printed in time this video related it's a way to God I talked to like for t-shirt printers but I just I couldn't find anyone who could do like this full pink shirt and tracking down this particular photograph in high-res was really quite difficult and and by the end I just sort of gave up oh I'll see if I can provide like a high quality PNG for you after this and them if you want to go get your own t-shirt made [Music] [Music] so that's the end of x1 [Music] yeah food the 29 of April [Music] [Applause] [Music] to get the sign up online you go admire some of the coordination name [Music] remakes break it down [Music] okay now this is the big day did you brush your teeth yeah I've got no idea of this kitties did you bring your camera yes mom did you eat your broccoli mom I'm trying to end a war let's bets Jason Russell's mom [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] I don't know if you can give us one Spotify it's on a greater public license [Music] this is yeah [Applause] [Music] right now I've found something interesting about this video so you know cringy has this they made it in three weeks which is fairly impressive with all this sort of stuff right but guess who edited and directed it I'm not sure if you've heard a movie called crazy rich Asians before but it's oh it's still in cinemas at the moment there's a guy who directed you know the now you see me movies this ones with the magicians with like Jesse Eisenberg and and all those actors at home hold on yeah yes so this guy Jon M Chu he directed crazy rich Asians now you see me too GI Joe retaliation like a lot of like big moves step up 3d he made this movie it's actually in the description of the video itself Jon M Chu helped direct me that I thought that was funny but there was this weird other thing which I wanted to put in the video and I just couldn't find a place for it so before Jason Russell went and made visible children warts he was friends with Jon M Chu yesterday still is and he and his wife and drawn him true wrote a musical called Moxie and he sold it the rights to it's a Steven Spielberg and nothing ever came of it they never made it into a movie but anyway I just think it's like this weird thing that should be mentioned somewhere so Jason Russell sold the movie script with the help of John iam true to Steven Spielberg at some point talk a bit about that car shooting I wanted to bring this a little bit up because in the video there's a scene where it says the car in front of us was shot by the LRA while driving through a rural village a car was shot in front of us by a rebel army who was led by a guy named Joseph Kony and I think this is an example of Jason stretching the truth a little bit you know where he didn't need to so they're on tour in Uganda they're being driven around by this local woman the local woman pulls over to the side of the road and starts talking to the locals they say you better get out of here because there's just been a car shot up at the side of the road two people were killed in it they quickly floor it and get to the next town which is Gullu and there they speak to some of the Ugandan army thankfully we made it into the city and started asking questions to stay in the town overnight Ugandan army then describes to them what happened and that there was a shooting confirming what the villagers said but the way that Jason tells it and the way that it's written about is as though they were there to witness it but they weren't everything is a secondhand account I thought that was just a sort of unnecessary stretching of the truth you know I I realize that people do this sort of stuff to make a story more sexy but it just didn't need to be how did Invisible Children start when Kony 2012 came out people assumed that this was the charities very first campaign and it wasn't they've been doing these things since 2005 they've actually got a number of very good programs that they continue with - today includes things like setting up schools scholarships even scholarships for some of the taught the child soldiers that have come out of the jungle is trying you know reform them and reintegrate them back into the the cities and villages and their their campaigns that have actually been pretty effective I don't think they got proper credit for a lot of that work a few other things included a series of radio towers an app that supposedly tracked the LRA so but essentially a warning system get the hell out of there they'd be coming your way as well as basic infrastructure kind of stuff what was the Ugandan government's response to the Kony 2012 video the Ugandan Board of tourism was not particularly happy when this video came out they think it actually hurt them for a couple of years afterwards people thought it was a war-torn hellhole and in fact the Prime Minister of Uganda after all these celebrities tweeted out you know hashtag Kony 2012 and jumped on that bandwagon he tweeted and then so at Justin Bieber at at Kim Kardashian yeah hey why not come to Uganda you know it's not as bad as he worth saying yes Oh damage control I think you'd call it what's up with that Moreno Ocampo guy okay I feel like I have to have a disclaimer for this one Moreno Ocampo former chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Court if if it comes out in the news that I committed suicide please investigate it as a murder also a historian you can't have any of my stuff I want it all to go to Frederick Knudsen so that he can make an investigative video because this guy seems pretty powerful and he's into all sorts of shady dealings so Moreno Ocampo first of all what was up with that plot well I think he's a bit of a social climber I think he wanted to get close to some celebrities because he has a fascination with celebrity and and he likes to be in the spotlight himself did he really think that that plot was gonna work hmm probably not I think it was sort of let's just see how far down the road we can get with this and see what happens kind of deal but the point was to spend time with Angelina Jolie preferably also with Brad Pitt and to be seen doing it I think that's why he invited her to all sorts of other events as well they've made up before several times I don't think Angelina Jolie and Brad took it too seriously to be honest from what I read of the emails that they're just exerts I wasn't able to get a hold of the whole you know batch of emails that we'll leave but I'm sure they get invitations to things all the time and you know the the polite thing to do is just is all year know we'll we'll chat it over and it sounds like a great opportunity and then let nothing happen is is usually the best course of action so that's what I think they were thinking from their side as I understand it I again I don't have the emails I don't actually know who has the emails anymore I think it was just a small selection that were leaked as part of a blackmailing campaign actually against him to try and hurt his character he said I miss you in an email to Angelina Jolie that was like the last of their correspondence as is my understanding and he got a response from Angelina's personal assistant who said oh she had a different email address now sir maybe it all ended a bit awkwardly I haven't seen them together recently but I think it's worth touching on that this guy is pretty shady I'm sure that little government especially in a corrupt institution like the UN that it's pretty difficult to to not be into some pretty shady things but as soon as he was finished with his tenure which is about eight years I think he went to a business associate of Gaddafi's he was an oil magnate and said to him hey why don't you give me a two million dollar retainer because I know you may be being investigated and I'll do nothing and you can just pay me two million dollars a year the the implication being that he would feed him information through his his network of contacts and then this money was supposed to be routed through a shell company which Moreno owned which sold like luxury briefcases and luggage and there's just all these weird things going on with this guy why didn't they ever just bomb the [ __ ] out of the LRA okay well there are five main reasons that I see so first of all is it's the wrong jurisdiction so of the Ugandan air force were to bomb Kony well they're gonna have a hard time if he's in the Central African Republic or in Sudan right the second is tied to that they don't know where he is so they're an opportunistic group they roam around they stay in the places of least resistance and they're also in the jungle so it's pretty hard to pin them down the bottom three this spread out so you're gonna have to flatten huge swaths of the forest in order to get a few guys fourth is that they're a diminishing threat you know whereas the LRA at its peak had over 10,000 troops they now have between one and two hundred the long term campaigns to have these people reintegrated back into the cities and villages is is working for the most part most most people have defected and the most important factor of all most of the people who were with Joseph Kony you probably wouldn't actually want a bomb so he's got kids with him he's got young girls essentially slaves people that you want to help and save rather than kill so here's a clip of Jason and Ben talking about that a lot of her comments were related to the fact that Joseph Kony is not by himself there's a lot of innocent women and children and abducted fighters that are near him and so any approach to stop the LRA it needs to be since I think that that's actually part of the deliberate strategy by Kearney had some you know it's a permanent hostage situation in some way where'd all those fat stacks go swiggity swoogity /black we had all the money go well that's a difficult question to answer because it's very hard to know without being within the organization but my understanding is this after Kony 2012 came out they thought wow what an enormous success despite you know some of the debris despite you know the mental breakdown and all that sort of stuff we've raised 23 million dollars this year fantastic there's so much we can do with that they have a model which is like 70% goes into production advertising getting the message out communications all this sort of stuff and 30% goes to the course that's not a good ratio it's a bad ratio but they're open and honest about it anyway but they raised twenty three million dollars three tenths of it goes to the cause so they said okay we've found a model that gives us enormous success let's replicate that here's the new campaign we're going to call it the Fourth Estate it is even broader and the idea of the Fourth Estate is essentially a an absolute up ending of the power structure of yeah it's it's like it's I don't even think they entirely knew what it was once all three days a citizenship founded on the belief [Music] are created and injustice for is not a fantasy it just ended up being so vague like end polity one of those kind of campaigns anyway after the whole controversy after kony2012 died out and they and they haven't been able to communicate or deliver any really concrete results like you know Kearney wasn't dead Kearney wasn't captioned people didn't really look at the Fourth Estate you know you can you can look at the difference in views like ones a hundred and three million and the other this list seventy thousand incredible drop-off so they had spent a whole bunch of money producing the Fourth Estate and then in the year 2013 they raised far less money it was it was like eleven million twelve million something like that less than half right but they in that time they had started expanding their operations so they went okay this model doesn't work right we're gonna have to we're gonna have to take a new approach and so since then I believe what they have done is take what remains of that twenty three million and put it towards long-term small-scale localized projects that actually are effective in the region flyer campaigns building schools infrastructure education programs radio tower networks then outreach programs with other organizations so in 2017 technically they closed their doors but on the U n jobs page they're still hiring so they you know they primarily as I understand of work with other organizations that's what's been done with the money it's mostly focused on those small-scale long-term localized projects so it's my understanding that a good portion of that money has gone to the right place oMG have you seen that video of one of the founders of Invisible Children drinking and saying he's going to steal some of the money question mark I wanted to address this one quickly just in case someone else brought it up and used it as a way to criticize Invisible Children so I'll play the video about me there's is it here 100,000 for Haiti and 900,000 and extra for me get on the bandwagon hey Africa is gonna come up in the world hey guys so that was one of the founders of Invisible Children the way this video presents us that he's drunk and saying that he's gonna keep nine tenths of a million dollars for himself and his organization and one tenth is gonna go to Haiti but the key thing to keep in mind here is that it's a joke it's like absolutely a joke this was published by TMZ shortly after the Kony 2012 video and when Jason was caught naked on the street as a way to further discredit the charity and first of all that Smirnoff bottle was filled with water he's not drinking vodka and second the whole purpose of the video is to congratulate his co-workers so they're in a different office across the country and this and he's basically saying congratulations you secured a grant of a million dollars for this cause Haiti I don't know all the precise details of it and he's just trying to have a [ __ ] laugh right they've been working towards something for a long time and they finally succeeded in getting it and then you know he's making a joke and this was presented as them stealing money from Haiti and I thought that's a pretty nasty and unfair thing to do what was Connie's response to the whole thing so the LRA put out an official statement when the Kony 2012 video was released they said indeed this is not the first time the Invisible Children has been used to play such a dirty role in Uganda The Invisible Children have been used to cover up on many occasions for the vile acts of the us-supported military regime of Uganda in its dirty war activities that his army has carried out against the civilian population in northern northeastern and Midwestern andá-- just to elaborate a little that's that's essentially the LRS purpose they see the uganda government as illegitimate they've purpose supposed to overthrow the government so that maybe it is a little more context what they're saying and that's about it they've had their runners with Invisible Children for and they're not fans were there any arrests over the vandalism I don't think so especially not for putting posters up here free rail which is really just annoying it's just littering whatever but some people did go around just spray-painting kony2012 on things including people's garage doors that was investigated although I don't believe anyone was ever arrested over it while the AG double hockey sticks just George Clooney have us by satellite it's the first thing to clarify is he doesn't own it he's essentially renting it it cost like ten million dollars just to launch the satellite at starting price and the upkeep is astronomical so he's partnering with Google and a whole bunch of other companies to do this supposedly they've managed to achieve some things like detecting bombs destroyed villages and some other evidence of destruction by the Sudanese army the the logic behind it as George Clooney says is that well if he is constantly being hounded by the paparazzi surely a dictator in Africa should be subject to the same level of scrutiny I don't quite follow that logic but I want I'd like the indicted war criminals to enjoy the same level of celebrity as me that seems fair that's our objective is to just shine a light on it but maybe it's doing some good it's hard to say where does Kony be at these days I don't want to pretend like I know more than I do so I'll have to be very surface level in the politics but this is what I understand the LRA operates very opportunistically they bumble around all these different areas on the borders of the Central African Republic the Congo Uganda sometimes Sudan South Sudan so he could be anywhere really it's most likely that he's somewhere in the Central African Republic but it could also be that he's taking refuge in Sudan now the reason for that as I understand you have essentially a civil conflict between the LRA and the government of Uganda now in Sudan and South Sudan it was a conflict as well you gained a support of the split and supported South Sudan Sudan the northern version of Sudan the bad one which is run by El Bashar he was not particularly happy about that so he funded the LRA as well as a bunch of more extremist Islamic groups to cause havoc in South Sudan and continue some of their operations in Uganda as well which is which is interesting because the LRA stands for the Lord's Resistance Army they are you know one part army and in some ways one part cold they're supposed to be a fundamentalist Christian group but here they are a lying with Islamist groups so a lot of this conflict has largely died down so there doesn't mean that the relationship between El Bashar and Joseph Kony is not existing anymore so it may be that Kony is in refuge in the south of North Sudan in a similar situation possibly two to let the way bin Laden was being housed in Pakistan a lot of that is speculation it's hard to know but again I'm not gonna pretend to know that I know more than I do take all of that with a boulder sized grain of salt so yeah what is Joseph Kony up to these days [ __ ] hiding out or they're actively roaming around just keeping out of the way of the local armies and waiting for the next opportunity to build up their forces again got any more clips and they're all y'all's gonna include this as well but I couldn't make it work masturbate yeah oh that's funny I've lost the video for it I was kind of included in the video this is this is where his eye actually is in the video and so I just sort of fixed it for him because organization and so we were like it's sort of looked down on his face of the traditional box of what you think about charity and nonprofit and we break it so I just sort of fixed it for him anyways can I have that as a joke in the video everything I thought wasn't aware for it oh this was a clip I didn't use so I'm gonna wait for those funny I felt this old clip which i think is worth watching of a young filly D I mean jumping on this movement and actually doing something in real life because the point of Kony 2012 is to make Joseph Kony famous people whether in hiding or not that is not a world I want to be in and that's the point of Kony 2012 is to make things and pony the most infamous man on the planet strike on the infection that is Joseph Kony's evil on this planet oh I'll provide this to the this the green screen is of Jason dancing I figured someone who want that and here's the one of under view if you want to put this in your own video and here's grant fall try crying and it's about it thanks for watching",36:33
nhQPBSa2w9k,Car Throttle,Automobile,6 Things You Should Unlearn From Your Driving Test,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhQPBSa2w9k,5 years ago,6.5M views,Automobile,six things you should on learn from your driving test the traditional driving test is an archaic system that's desperately in need of an update so with that in mind here are six driving test techniques you should forget as soon as you get your license feeding the wheel the pull push method also known as feeding the wheel is arguably the most important driving test technique the idea behind it is that it allows you to keep both hands on the wheel at all times therefore making you a safer driver but this is [ __ ] feeding the wheel is inefficient outdated and in some circumstances it can be dangerous imagine that you're on a country road and you approach a blind corner you enter what you think is a shallow Bend but as you turn in the corner starts to decrease in radius to avoid running wide you need to add more steering lock quickly but smoothly attempt to pull and push the wheel and you'll end up making jagged inputs at a point where the car is already unstable you will therefore crash and probably die so instead make sure you keep both hands on the wheel and cross your arms to ensure you add steering input progressively constantly applying the handbrake the handbrake is your best friend on the UK driving test and almost every time you stop you're required to use it thankfully most drivers come to their senses and drop this bad habit once they've passed their test in reality there's no need to hand brake every time you come to a halt if you're in stop-start traffic for example the foot brake will usually suffice and if you need to make an emergency stop in a pileup situation the last thing you should do is apply the handbrake checking your mirrors at predetermined intervals every time you pull away in the UK you should conduct a six-point check where you look over your left shoulder check your left exterior mirror check your rear-view mirror check the road ahead check your right mirror and then finally look over your right shoulder on your test you need to make these checks look super obvious to avoid incurring any minor penalties our problem with this technique is the fact that it turns situational awareness into a box ticking exercise not flashing other road users the Highway Code states that you should only flash your headlights to let other road users know that you are there do not flash your headlights to convey any other messages as a result you cannot flash your headlights on your driving test and you cannot react to someone else flashing their lights at you this form of communication has the potential to be hazardous but in most cases we find it to be very helpful flashing people to say thank you or to let them into a line of traffic is a daily occurrence for most of us and whatever you might have been told flashing your lights in the UK is not illegal speed is your enemy controversially the driving test in the UK fails to incorporate any form of motorway driving the majority of lessons take place in busy towns or cities where the maximum speed limit will be limited to 30 miles an hour as a result young drivers often use speed as the enemy this isn't a problem on crowded streets but it can play havoc when it comes to driving on motorways where it's vital that you accelerate to match the speed of fast traffic when merging unfortunately learner drivers and new drivers often get intimidated and slowed down on on ramps which can cause chaos constantly checking your speed speeding during your driving test can result in instant failure and as a result most learners spend the majority of their assessment staring at the speedo this is because the test is nothing more than a box ticking exercise as long as you're under the limit you're deemed to be safe unfortunately this is not the case if you're doing the speed limit but not focusing on the road ahead this is more dangerous than speeding itself thankfully the more you drive the more accustomed you become to multitasking bonus point using your indicators if you drive a BMW if after passing your driving test your daddy buys you a sweet BMW you must drain it's indicator fluid immediately and only use the pull and flash function of the indicator stalk as a means to show your displeasure for people in lesser cars no matter what you learn in your driving test BMW drivers are not required to indicate now the next reason for my e36 m3 choice is the noise now the e46 m3 sounds very distinctive it sounds very metallic very raspy it's a bit like someone who's been smoking and who's in desperate need of a cigarette you know they're a bit like ah ah is that right it's that pretty 46 m3 ish,4:10
VNRuzCohElk,gameranx,VideoGames,Nintendo Switch - 10 Tips & Tricks You Probably Didn't Know,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNRuzCohElk,4 years ago,7.9M views,VideoGames,the release of the Nintendo switch is finally here we finally have our hands on it and there are definitely some things that you shouldn't know to get you started with it I imagine the new guy and today game ranks we're to talk about ten and tend to switch quick tips you may not have known starting off at number 10 this is something that I may have already fallen victim to unfortunately I'm not entirely sure but you do have to be careful when we're moving the Joye con straps from the joy con controller itself because it's pretty easy to break it getting it on is fairly simple each trap works on both joy cons so you just have to make sure you're lining up the plus and minus signs before actually sliding it into place but it's taking it off that may cause the issue after it's on you'll find a lock button or switch I guess you can call it on the bottom of the joy con and it locks in the direction that you have to push to remove the strap so when you take the strap off you have to make sure you disengage that lock and then also push the gray release button on the back of the joy con and then pull the strap off but you do have to be careful you don't reengage that lock when you're pulling off the strap even with doing it right it still feels kind of finicky like getting it off doesn't actually feel right but don't freak out as long as you're following the steps and you can't obviously tell that you broke it you should be fine and up next at number 9 one cool thing you may not have known is that the switch is actually region free which is cool for you because now you have access to more games you could actually set up a second profile on your switch and have that one attached to the Japanese eShop and you can download and play all the games from there so here's a quick rundown on how you'll do it you'll have to go to my Nintendo comm forward slash getting underscore started and from here you'll have to make a new account and want to ask you for your country of origin you have to put in Japan and after you hit submit and verify your account you'll then have to create a new profile on your switch and tie that account that you just created to that profile so once you open up the eShop voila you not have access to every game on the Japanese shop there are a few games and a few demos that aren't available in the North American I shop and there are certain games on there that do have English support so make sure you do your research before you start purchasing and while this may not seem like a lot now just think about the future this is a whole other outlet to get access to even more games and next up at number eight when you hold down the home button it actually brings up a quick menu without closing at your game and returning you to the main menu and here you can see your time and your battery level you can also put the console into sleep mode turn auto brightness on and put the console into airplane mode and also adjust the brightness manually this is a pretty neat little menu to have access to another quick tip turning down your brightness a little bit if you can't afford it is a pretty good idea because if you turn it down a decent amount but to the point where it's still playable you can get another 30 to 45 minutes of play time out of breath of the wild and we all need as much of that precious all the time as we can get and up next number seven this is more of a PSA and then the tip really but I highly advise you don't put a skin on your switch decal maker debrand seem to actually be the ones who put the warning out there and has actually gone as far to refund anyone who's purchased a decal from them and the problem is actually in the adhesive that is used on the skins it doesn't play well with the switch and controllers and it actually ruins the finish like you can find pictures of it online and it really makes a bit of a mess d-bryan actually tested the skin themselves and a few different switches before concluding that the skins just don't work well with it this is a huge bummer seeing that some of the skins are really cool-looking I totally thought about making my switch look like an SNES and now I definitely can't props the deeper and though they missed out on a ton of money by giving everyone the heads up about this and refunding orders kudos to you that's awesome next up at number six we've all known for a bit now that you can share games that you bought with other players but we finally have the details on how it works and it is a bit limited first off if you have different profiles on your console any games that were purchased on that console can be shared with every other profile so that's cool if you consoles being played by multiple people in household you can all share the games that you all buy but sharing between different consoles works a little bit different there is some small print to look at in order to play a digital game on another console you have to deactivate the original console from being your active one and then you have access to the game on the second console you can only play it on that console that is now the active one so it is kind of a bummer how sharing works it doesn't work exactly how we probably would have liked it to but it's really not too much of a deal-breaker but at least you can share games that you purchased between the profiles on your console I think that's a pretty neat thing to have and at number five I'm sure you already know this but the switch supports micro SD cards but there are some little things that you may not have known about it but one the card sits behind the kickstand which is kind of an odd place for it so when the kickstand is out and being used the card behind it is actually exposed which bothers me a little bit but then again I am a crazy paranoid mess so that is something that we'll bother me and the switch also supports high-capacity microSD cards that don't even exist yet so that's pretty cool Nintendo did future-proof the system in that aspect one thing you definitely need to know though is that you can't share microSD cards between different consoles if you do try the switch will tell you that that card is being used with another console and you'll have to format the card to use another new one you also can't copy game save files from the console to the card actually you can't transfer your saves from the console at all so you can't transfer your saves or back them up to anything so don't lose your switch because if you do you'll be losing all your saves next up number four there's definitely some things you need to know about the charging situation with the console overall joy cons included first up you can't have the console using the kickstand and charge it at the same time because the USB C port is on the bottom of the console also if you plan on taking your switch somewhere and you need to charge it up I advise not playing it in TV mode while you do it because the charge is really slow when you do this slower than it really should and then there's a joy con charging situation which might bother some people the joy con grip that the console ships with is essentially only a shell it won't charge a joi cons there is however a 30-hour charging grip that can charge the grips why plugging in the grip into the console so out of the box the only way to charge the joy cons is by having them attached to the console itself when the console isn't being used or having them attached to the console by playing with the pro controller but the joy cards do suppose we have a 20 hour battery life so you shouldn't run into much trouble there that is a pretty good amount of time another thing to keep in mind is that the switch will have a hard time charging from a lot of different portable charging packs if you're charging it while it's in sleep mode you shouldn't really have too much of an issue but if you're going to be playing and charging at the same time that's will your run into trouble the switch shifts with a 15 volt power cable so it's safe to assume the console needs at least in that range to actually get power so you'll need a portable charger that has a higher voltage that can handle the 15 volt power cable but like I said if you're on the go as long as you're charging you when it's a sleep mode you really shouldn't have much of an issue up next number three you might notice that going from handheld mode to TV mode but the colors might look a tad bit washed out depending on the display that you're using it's definitely more noticeable with breadth of the wild and you're definitely gonna want to mess with the TV settings on the switch and also mess with the settings on your display on the switch itself I'd set your resolution from automatic to whatever your display resolution actually is and then change your RGB range from automatic to full range but also make sure that your display is set to full range too because if you don't it's not gonna work properly and most displays are set to limited range by default then from there you're gonna want to head to your display settings and play around until you get a picture quality that works for you and if your display has a low input lag HDMI input I definitely recommend using that input if you don't already have another console utilizing it so if you've been noticing a different picture quality between handheld and TV mode I would definitely check it out and see if you can tweak it a little bit also if your switches turning on your TV or ceiling an input when you dock it go back to TV settings on the console and turn match TV mode to off the default setting is on so you definitely have to make sure you go in and look at it this should solve that problem it up next number two of the folks over at little pointed this out and this is something huge and it's probably in your best interest to invest in a screen protector if you head over to glicks alow and check out their article about it you can see that their switch has gathered some pretty serious scratches on the bottom left hand corner and they're saying that's from the dock it's pretty easy to miss the USBC port on the dock so you do usually have to jiggle it until it clicks into place and even if you do it carefully you'll still eventually happen to scrape the console against the dock so add screen protector is definitely a good idea if you don't want to scratch up your console and if for some reason you can't get a screen protector right away there are some quick fixes you can find online me personally I laid a microfiber cloth on the inside of the dock so the front of the console has something besides plastic to go up against and I think this will work until my screen protector comes in so definitely be wary of when you put your console into the dock and finally a number one just some quick little things to wrap up with quick if you tap the battery icon on the home page it'll give you the battery percentage or if you hit the ZL and Zr buttons it'll do the same thing but if you don't like looking at your battery percentage that way you can go into settings and there's an option to turn on so you can have the percentage shown at all times on the home screen to get to that you go to system settings from the home page and then once you're in that menu you scroll all the way down to settings and you'll see it right there and before you go and spend the $70 on a pro controller do make sure to spend some time with the joy con grip it might not be as bad as you think it's actually pretty good also those really nice Bluetooth headphones you bought I hope you're really excited to not use them because the switch doesn't support bluetooth headphones which is a big miss I don't know how Nintendo that slip by it also can't use low impedance headphones without the help of an amp so that's kind of a bummer too and if you didn't know your joy Kahn's do work with PC Mac and Android devices and don't forget to register your physical games for a nintendo rewards you're gonna hit the plus button while having the game selected and you'll see exactly how to do it so those some quick tips that are definitely worth knowing if you picked up a Nintendo switch or if you plan on getting one but I want to hear from you guys meet me down in the comments if there's anything I missed please let me know and if you have any other quick tips you might want to share with a fellow commenter go ahead and do it and hitting that like button really helps us out and if you didn't know we put up videos like this every single day and the best way to get them is with a subscription to the channel and once again i'm andrew the new guy and i'll see you guys next time right here on gamer eggs,9:39
Jpd_CUX2o98,Bon Appétit,Food,Every Way to Cook a Steak (43 Methods) | Bon Appétit,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jpd_CUX2o98,2 years ago,8.8M views,Food,hi I'm a meal Stanek editor-at-large at Bon Appetit and this is almost every way to cook a steak alright we're looking at a whole bunch of steaks what makes a steak a steak well typically a steak is a cut of beef that is tender enough and contains enough intramuscular fat or marbling to be cooked quickly as opposed to tougher cuts that are used for braising or slow cooking there are a whole bunch of steaks on the cow but today what we're working with is the boneless ribeye steak we love this cut because has plenty of marbling these thick ribbons of fat that keep things nice and juicy and a tidy compact shape and we're gonna cook it every way we can think of let's look at some ways of not cooking a steak shall we first up steak tartare we're simply gonna dice our steak into nice little pieces people like to put all kinds of things in tartare but here we're just gonna use some egg yolk olive oil black pepper and salt boom steak tartare it's really pretty it's nice and kind of glossy with the olive oil in the egg yolk mmm really delicious you can really taste the beef in its purest form here and the bitterness of the olive oil backs up the grassiness of the meat this is an amazing way to eat raw steak if that kind of thing doesn't make you squeamish that is carpaccio we're gonna cut out a nice centerpiece from our steak we're gonna butterfly it and then we're gonna sandwich it between two pieces of plastic wrap and pound it out until it's about a quarter of an inch to an eighth of an inch thick a little salt and olive oil and voila beef carpaccio this looks great however you can see that there's some kind of gnarly schmears of fat in there which isn't ideal carpaccio is usually made with a leaner cut like tenderloin not a fatty one like ribeye mmm it's still really tasty though beefy and clean I'd love a little spicy arugula and shaved parm on top raw steak smoothie we're gonna cut our steak toss it in this high-powered blender pinch of salt a little bit of water let her rip that looks truly foul okay there it is folks steak smoothie honestly it smells horrible I don't know why it's just water and steak but something about the processing did something truly evil looks like a cross between pink slime and a strawberry milkshake it's so thick oh it's horrible this is truly disgusting do not try this at home folks seared steak first we're gonna hit both sides of the steak with plenty of kosher salt it might look like a lot but steak really needs it then we're just gonna give it a straightforward sear on both sides in this smoking hot cast-iron pan all right nice coloring around the edges but not so much in these center parts that didn't make contact with the pan the interior looks really nice but there's a bit more of this overcooked gray ring that I'd like hmm I'm not mad about it it's still tender but would have been even more juicy if that fat had had time to soften not bad but it's not perfect seared and basted steak we're gonna salt it and get the steak into that smoking hot pan now that we've got color on both sides I'm gonna turn the heat down flip some butter in there and base it a bit until it finishes cooking Wow this smells amazing we've got a little bit more browning because we didn't have to rush the meat out of the pan we've still got a bit of that gray layer the fat is really nicely rendered Wow so juicy and delicious the nutty brown butter mixing with the beef fat is really something this is definitely the tastiest stovetop only method but it's probably best for a slightly thicker steak you know it's getting a little smoky in here let's take the steak party to the backyard for a bit grilled steak four ways we've got a whole steak that we've oiled and salted we've got cubes of steak that we've threaded onto skewers we've got some thinly sliced strips of steak that we've woven back and forth onto skewers and then we have some thinly sliced beef and we're gonna pull each of these off the grill as they're ready grilled steak one advantage of grilling over pan cooking is the heat is so much more intense so we're seeing much better carmelization Wow the interior looks awesome we've got an almost wall-to-wall medium-rare mmm super juicy a little bit of smoke flavor plenty of char this is one of my all-time favorite ways to cook a steak cubed and skewered steak we're looking at way more surface area here than on a whole steak so we've got more beautiful char all around each piece Wow look at that perfect interior hmm really tender tons of brown flavor still impressively juicy this can be tricky to get right but when it's right it's really really right sliced and skewered steak here we have even more surface area than our cube steak so you've got even more char which is awesome mmm there's still a bit of pink but it's definitely way more cooked hmm even though it's not medium-rare we've traded that perfect interior for tons of crispy crackly charred bits this is really tasty it would be even better with some kind of soy agar glaze tinleigh sliced steak so here we've completely maximized surface area these took on a ton of color but they're all gonna be well-done no matter what mmm not bad a smidge on the drier side compared with the other grilled steaks we've tried but they've got a ton of good smoked flavor and plenty of char all right let's head back inside shall we toaster steak okay first things first we're gonna have to cut our steak and a half just to get the pieces to fit in the damn thing we're gonna pop it in and see what comes out on the other side pop goes the weasel' it's done okay the exterior leaves something to be desired this fat cap actually brown pretty nicely I'm kind of expecting the inside to be a mess Wow more grey that I want but not too shabby temperature-wise pretty nice actually definitely wish there was more caramelization but shockingly not bad easy big steak this may be the first time anyone has ever cooked a steak in an easy-bake oven in the history of the world it's not gonna fit so we're gonna have to trim it to fit this teeny tiny tray we're gonna slide it in here to bake and flip it halfway through voila easy big steak I mean honestly it's completely great but it's hard to tell it seems to be neither wrong nor cooked oh there's something wrong with the way it tastes honestly it's pretty juicy but it tastes like plastic fumes I got to spread this out laser steak I gotta put some safety goggles on because this is apparently the most powerful laser that a consumer can buy behold the Thanos five thousand megawatt laser pointer trying to put the batteries in and screw it together and then use this key to unlock the safety yeah yeah there is a safety and now we're good to go I guess let er rip yeah no it actually looks this crazy it's not photoshopped I promise okay I guess it's done so here we have our laser cooked mostly not cooked stick this is pretty much a raw steak with this little patch here that does seem to be kind of cooked so I'm gonna try to kind of excise that I feel like I'm performing a biopsy okay oh no something is horribly wrong here it tastes like burnt hair no more lasers not ever no more lasers stir fried steak we're gonna slice our steak into nice thin pieces because the idea here is that we bunt throw them in and cook them as briefly as possible a little bit of oil meat goes in toss toss toss so nothing sticks and we're done stir fried steak right off the bat I'm gonna say that we could have left these in the wok for another minute probably we've got some nice char around the edges here but a lot of bits that are still a bit medium medium rare mmm there's a distinct wok flavor going on here it's a specific irresistible smokiness that I associate with this kind of cooking shaved and griddled steak we're gonna lock our steak into this deli slicer and shave it really thin the way you would for a cheese steak we're gonna oil up our smoking hot griddle and slap the sliced meat down we're going for maximum carmelization here not a medium rare now we're gonna flip it use our spatula to shred it up a bit nice so this is really all about the contrast between the fully cooked but still juicy steak and these very brown bits mmm super succulent those crispy bits are almost like bacon so so good get me some Cheez Whiz steak burger we're gonna take our very cold steak cut it into chunks and feed it through the meat grinder now we're gonna form it gently into a fat patty season it with salt and sear it in a hot cast-iron mmm Burger Time look at that crust we've got a ton of nice browning around the edges and it's very tender since we practiced so loosely we basically deconstructed and reorganized a steak mmm YUM I don't even want a bun the contrast is killer bud you can get a similar result with a cheaper cut of beef honestly you know I'm ready for a little fresh air let's head back outside campfire steak three ways this first steak we're gonna slap on to this preheated rock this one we're gonna put directly onto these hot coals and this one has been mummified we covered it with salt and wrapped it in wet cloth for some reason now we're gonna flip these over and they should be done hot rock stick yeah you know I'm pretty disappointed with the crust here yeah it's a hair overcooked and pretty under browned honestly it's fine a little extra smoke flavor but I can't see why I would bother with the rock coal cooked steak Wow we've got some really impressive color going on here but I can tell it's a bit overcooked and there's quite a bit of graying here a lot of smoky flavor though and still pretty juicy on the whole I love this method but it's a bit of a wild one good but tough to control my fried steak okay this is clearly a hot mess it looks like a burnt diaper Oh still on fire hold on okay it's really unevenly cooked and the outside is really disappointingly pale Oh horrible it's inedibly salty and taste like a burn t-shirt if you like I have to go inside to take a shower now I feel filthy oil and steak lube oil ribeye steak we would we're gonna season our water with salt and just slip our stick right in there and we're gonna pull it out when we've got an internal temperature of 125 degrees yummy all right so no browning at all no my yard reaction is happening in such a wet environment it looks gross just gray all over and that fat looks especially nasty it's pretty perfect inside it's tender but it seems to have lost some of its juiciness and medium-rare with no browning at all just tastes kind of flabby and gross hot-boxed Inc we've got our pot of hot broth bubbling we are gonna slice our steak as thinly as possible and now we're just gonna lower our meat right in there and let it cook for no more than 15 seconds or so and then we're gonna pluck it right out tada so if we were really eating a hot pot we'd be putting pieces in individually pulling them out and eating them immediately with rice maybe a dipping sauce instead of cooking it all at once and just plain old chicken stock there's no browning at all that's to be expected hmm it's not bad it's very tender but typically this will be made with a much more flavorful broth steamed steak you know for some reason this sends even grosser than boiling a steak to me we're gonna season our steak plop it right in our steamer basket close the lid and set a timer I guess it's done steam steak this looks pretty identical to the boiled steak it's maybe a little less soggy looking it's pretty rare but I really don't like the looks of all that unrendered unsoftened fat there I mean it actually tastes a bit better season than our boiled steak which is a plus but the flavor is pretty indefensible braised steak we're gonna start by searing the steak on both sides of this Dutch oven then we're gonna add just enough liquid to almost submerge it cover it and let this slow cook for about two and a half hours well that is definitely well-done while some of these outside pieces are really tender this I of the rib eye is actually pretty good huh feeling hmm I mean it's beefy tasting it's not bad but I feel like the steak gods are really mad at me for this one this is one expensive pot roast sous-vide steak we're gonna season our steak we're gonna pop it in this plastic bag and we're gonna use a vacuum sealer to suck out all the air and seal it then we're gonna put it into this pot fitted with an immersion circulator which is gonna keep this water at a consistent 128 degrees for the next hour and a half and now that our steak is a perfect medium-rare inside we're gonna get it out of the bag and sear it on both sides just until it's browned boom done we're seeing pretty good at browning here which didn't take much time at all to achieve and that inside a perfect almost wall-to-wall medium-rare and that's the big advantage of sous-vide cooking it tastes great but there's a slight almost sponginess that I don't love it's perfect technically but it's a little bit soulless if you ask me a steak who's excited about big stink no this is oiled and salted and we're gonna pop it in a 350-degree oven for about 6 minutes now we're gonna flip it and give it another 6 and that is done all right I can already tell this steak wanted way more heat no carmelization to speak of and this fat isn't looking so good I mean it is nicely cooked inside though it's tender but I wish it had been seared first 350 was definitely not enough to get the job done on its own this feels like half a way to cook a steak broiled steak so big didn't work out that well let's see if we have better luck with the broiler we're basically gonna do the same thing just a little bit less time and at a higher temperature give it a flip ooh smoky I think that's done all right we're looking at a disappointing lack of color the fat got a bit crispy but that's about it we've got a lot of that kind of gray ring here it wasn't quite hot enough I think hmm not terrible but I'd much rather have a steak cooked in the pan why don't we take a backyard break while some of this smoke clears searzall steak we've got our steak we've got our searzall which is basically just a modified blowtorch and we're gonna use it to apply really really direct high heat to the whole surface of the steak Wow it's getting really hot all right that's got to be done I'm calling it you know it was a pain in the ass to hold that hot blowtorch for so long we've got some really good color going on here but cutting in that there are some parts that look nice some that are over and some that are undercooked it's not awful and I really appreciate the flavor of that crust but it's too difficult to cook the steak evenly this way for me to want to do it again steak on a stick so we've got a steak impaled on a stick and we're gonna cook it caveman style right over the flames turning it every few minutes or so so it cooks evenly that's really smoky and really really hot okay that's got to be done now so the exterior is really more singe than anything else and it's definitely on the rare side hmm a lot of smoke flavor I mean this isn't a bad method necessarily but holding it in front of that fire was pretty uncomfortable in tedious afterburner steak we've got a chimney full of hot coals here we're just gonna put this stake directly over the chimney like so this thing is hot people time to give it a flip and she's done got some impressive browning almost verging on charred but it's definitely a little uneven this definitely would've been better with a bigger chimney or a smaller stake the inside is actually pretty gorgeous mm-hmm big smoke flavor really juicy but there's some grisly bits that needs more time to render this method has a ton of potential all right let's take this back inside George Foreman steak we had to do it folks steak goes in close it and let the boxing box do its thing we've got grill marks but we don't have a nice even char that we like to see the insides fine hmm not bad not great waffle iron steak now we're gonna sling this steak into a hot waffle iron and see what happens we're gonna have to weigh it down so it stays closed Wow that is something we've got some decent color at those points of contact nowhere else and it's definitely overcooked yeah already dry there's no reason to cook a steak this way infrared grilled steak so this spooky looking thing is an infrared grill which apparently is okay to use indoors we're gonna slap the steak right on there doesn't seem that hot considering how little it sizzling all right that should do it I think this may be haunted the steak more than it cooked it very limited browning and it's not terrible inside but there's a little more of that gray than you want to see mmm I mean I don't hate it but I don't see why you turn your kitchen into a haunted house when you can just heat up a pan pass and to oven steak we're gonna try a bit of a hybrid method here first we're gonna see our steak on both sides in this smoking-hot cast-iron pan then we're gonna transfer it to a 450 degree oven and let it I'm up to temperature and it's done okay we've definitely got some pretty good browning and it picked up some extra color probably in the oven hmm I don't love the inside a little bit more of the gray yeah hmm I like it but it's not nearly as precise as some of the other methods we've seen today tanta broiler steak similar but a little bit different now we're gonna sear our steak in a hot pan and then finish it under the broiler give it a flip tada impressive color the broiler did a lot of good work and the inside it's a pretty spot-on hmm this is surprisingly good better than the other pan de oven method I still think that fat needed a little bit more time to render but not too shabby reverse sear at stake this time we're gonna put our steak in a 225 degree oven for about 25 minutes first just until it's medium-rare then we're gonna sear it in a hot cast-iron pan for about a minute on each side just like that it's done reverse sear at steak amazing color on this one and I'm loving the way the interior looks great wall-to-wall color and the fat looks wobbly and perfect mmm great balance between that tender soft meat and that crispy exterior this is definitely one of my all-time favorite ways to cook a steak deep fried steak everything's better fried right we're just gonna season our steak and lower it into this pot of 350 degree vegetable oil and see what comes out on the other side let that extra oil drip off and we've got a deep fried steak that hot oil delivered really really even color which we like but it's also kind of greasy looking yeah it's a bit overcooked I think this method could work really well but deep-frying is just kind of annoying country fried steak normally you'd make a country fried steak with a cheap tough cut but we fancy first we're gonna use a meat mallet to pound it thin and create some texture then we're gonna dredge it in seasoned flour then an egg milk mixture then flour again and then deep-fry until it's golden brown all over damn that looks good so we've got this beautiful golden battered exterior but that's coming at the expense of any actual carmelization of the meat itself yeah the inside is definitely more medium to medium well hmm I mean it's delicious this is definitely a great way to cook a steak but not such a pricey one fries fried steak we're gonna score and season our steak and then we're gonna freeze it completely overnight now that it's rock-hard we're gonna deep-fry it so the outside is crusty but the inside is still totally frozen and then we're gonna bake it until the inside comes up to temperature and then we're gonna fry it again so the outside gets extra crispy and there you have it folks Wow incredible color from the deep frying some of the best we've seen today but inside is is very impressive but not 100% perfect hmm this seasoning really penetrated though because it had so much time to sink in and it's really tender and really flavorful it's a neat party trick but a little overboard considering what we were able to get with the regular old reverse here all right let's take a smoke break smoked steak the smokers all fired up we're gonna pop our steak in there for 20 to 30 minutes so I can cook through and then we're gonna finish it on a super hot grill oh this one smells amazing it's almost like pastrami and that crust is gorgeous exactly what we like to see oh that beautiful color wall-to-wall pink really juicy looking mmm YUM this is really special tons of smoke flavor delicious char so so succulent I'll definitely be doing this again you know that was almost too good which probably means it's time to make a microwave steak all right we're gonna take our beautiful pricy ribeye steak salt it and put it in the microwave for a total of four minutes flipping it halfway through happy I'm not oh this looks gross honestly it looks like prime rib that's been regurgitated like it cooked from the inside out or something this makes me want to cry honestly promise me you'll never do this okay instant pot steak all right we're gonna use the saute function too Brown both sides of the steak which seems to work actually pretty well then we're gonna add water pressurize the pot and cook it for about ten minutes and that is an instant pot redline we've got these fattier exterior pieces that are soft and still rich on the inside muscle is really dried out it doesn't taste the head per se but this would obviously be so much better with a chuck roast or other cut of beef that begs for long slow cooking not this beautiful steak slow cooker steak before we slow cook our steak to death we're gonna sear it on both sides then we're gonna put it into the slow cooker with just enough water to submerge it and set it on low for five hours oh that does not look good so after all that time this steak really shrunk up I can tell that it's gonna be a lot drier than our braised or instant pot steak this is sad five hours was too many hours sorry for doing this to you steak steak jerky we're gonna cut this ribeye into thin strips salt them and then pop them in the dehydrator to dry out for ten hours all right let's pull these out and take a look looks like jerky all right you know what's interesting here is how much color we got at such a low temperature over such a long period of time yeah you handed this to me I would say it's great beef jerky but knowing that it could have been a juicy medium-rare steak that hurts dehydrated and seared steak so now we're gonna try a slightly different version of a reverse here we're gonna use the dehydrator for the initial cooking instead of the oven this is gonna cook it 122 degrees for about four hours all right slide that out now that it's up to temp and the outside looks kind of jerky like we're gonna sear it quickly in a cast-iron pan wow that looks good huh obviously that took some time but that outside color is worth it this is probably the best caramelized steak we've seen all day and that interior stunning medium-rare it looks really rich and glossy I can't wait to try this one Wow this tastes incredible really complex brown flavors look fat got soft without rendering out so it's really juicy and the flavor is super concentrated this is an awesome way to cook a steak if you've got four hours on your hands all right today we cooked a whole lot of steaks in a whole lot of different ways what have we learned all of our favorite versions were evenly browned and crusty on the outside and uniformly pink and juicy on the inside there are a whole lot of different ways to achieve this result but by far the most effective methods combined a low and slow technique with a hot and fast one also just say no to microwaves oh and in case you're wondering we used all that leftover steak to make a killer batch of chili have a favorite way to cook a steak that you didn't see here drop it in the comments,23:15

HLedllETYD4,A&E,News,Live PD: Top 5 Busts | A&E,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLedllETYD4,2 years ago,27M views,News,"[music playing] This vehicle I spotted
just a little while ago driving a little reckless. He swerved into a opposite
lane, or outside of his lane a couple times. He's driving way
underneath the speed limit. Let me pull him
over, see if he's OK. Hey, how are you? You doing OK? What's going on? Do you have a driver's
license with you? Do you have an insurance
card with you as well, please? So the reason I
stopped you was-- You show that you
live off West Palmer lane, which is pretty close. So have you been
drinking anything today? Have you had
anything to smoke? Any medication? Anything like that? Because if you're
this distraught, and you're making these
mistakes on the roadway, you're going to
cause an accident. It's raining out here. It's wet, all right? Not a good thing. Do me a favor and step out
of the car for me real quick. Do me a favor, and step out
of the car real quick, OK? Yes, yes. I'm not going to tell you again. Come back over here
so I can talk to you. Right over here. Sure it is. I got a legal stop and
attention on you, all right? So I'm going to tell you
what's going to happen. Detective Derner is going
to bring his canine, and he's going to
run around the car to make sure you don't have
anything in this vehicle that you're not
supposed to have. All right, you
know what that means? That means that that dog just
alerted to that, that vehicle, OK? It's no longer
a consent search. It's a probable cause
search [inaudible].. I saw him alert. Hm. Yeah. Do me a favor. Turn around for me. Turn around. Turn around. That's a lot. Oh, is that bad? Meth? Oh, Bulk bags. What's up with all the baggies? Not your vehicle? OFFICER: Sir, heroin,
fentanyl morphine, oxycodone. We found a ledger that
was names and amounts owed, located a bunch of money
in the vehicle as well. There's probably
some drug dealing involved, obviously, here. She claims this stuff
doesn't belong to her. We just found some pill
bottles with her name on them. OFFICER: Gun. I've obviously
located a firearm. OFFICER: One with a chamber. One with a chamber
loaded, obviously. It looks like a 9 millimeter. Oh, some syringes. How long have we've been using? You don't want
to talk anymore? OK. The gun didn't come back stolen. We did continue to
test a lot of the stuff that we were locating. At this point, she's going to
go to jail for the possession of heroin, the UCW, which is
unlawful carrying of a weapon, and the possession
of methamphetamine. Oh, look at that tire. See the back of her tire? That tire looks ultradangerous. So I'll find out what's going
on with this back rear tire. [police radio chatter] Hello. You can open it. I don't want to stand on that
side because I'll get run over. WOMAN: No. I don't want you
to get run over. No. My window doesn't go down. Who's car is this? MAN: It's mine. Are you aware that
back wheel is doing this? Everybody jump out of the car. He's going to write the
warning for unsafe equipment. It's going to be that
rear driver wheel. Just come on back
here to this deputy. OK, so we're getting
some nervous looks. Probably going to definitely
deploy the dog on this one. Hey, come on. Come on. You good girls. You good girls. The canine alerted to the
vehicle for narcotics. Anybody got any
narcotics in the vehicle? Anything in that
vehicle whatsoever? There shouldn't be
anything in that vehicle. Nothing in the vehicle? I don't have
anything [inaudible].. [inaudible]. All right.
All right. Hang tight with this deputy. It's a whole kit, spoons,
syringes, the whole nine yards. Hm. There we go. [police radio chatter] That's going to be
methamphetamine. Faster in the backseat, we've
gotten meth and heroin on her. So right now, both of
them are going to jail. So how long you been
dating [inaudible]?? OK, so about a month. You knew used. What's her drug of choice? Is it meth, or is this dilaudid,
or a little bit of both? OK. All right, stay right
here for me, all right? Is it [bleep] or is it yours? WOMAN: It's not mine. OK, it's not yours. The only thing I can do
is charge you with it. It's in your possession. What else can I do? You're kind of putting me
in a rock and a hard place on this one. I got to be honest with you. Then whose is it? It's-- OK. See? That's all you had to say. All right, I'm going
to dig through the car just a little bit more, see
if we can find anything else. [police radio chatter] Oh, man. Heroin, it was stuffed
right here behind in back of the center console. It's going to be some heroin. So all right. We're done for now. Let's go hook him up. Turn around. Put your hand behind your back. Why? What's up? The heroin I found, I found
shoved in on the driver's side, you don't know
anything about that? No, I don't know
anything about that. I guarantee it. I've never touched
heroin in my life. I guarantee you that's hers. If you go ask her, [inaudible]. It's funny. I did ask her, and she said
everything's yours, actually. So-- I'm just telling
you what she said. Well, but I just found heroin. I just found meth on
the driver's side. No, you didn't. Yeah, I did. I've actually seen cars with
tires like that literally explode from the heat. So you can't be
driving like that. And basically, it all
started from that, and making contact with
them, and talking with them. So you never know what you're
going to get on a traffic stop. I have a 67 suspect that
I've been looking for, and he's right here. MAN: What's a 67? Shoplifting. 242. [police radio chatter] Code 20 reference my call. Louisiana plates 603. Now we're pulling
onto [inaudible].. Driver, step out. You need my license? Yeah. I'll get all that
in a second, man. Just do me a favor. Step over here for me. I'm Officer Ricky
Fontenot, the Lafayette City Police Department. What's your name, man? - Trey.
- Trey? Listen, I'm just going to
do a quick little pat down for weapons, OK? You have anything on you? Jarrod, she's in there. Do you have anything
on you that's going to stick you or poke me?
- [inaudible]. Look, I'm just detaining
you for right now, OK? You're not under arrest. I'm going to explain to you
everything in a second, OK? She's a suspect from
a shoplifting, OK? So do me a favor. Hang tight right there. Because you're driving the car. Do me a favor. Turn around put your
hands behind your back. What's going on? What's happening? All right, handcuffs. - Am I being detained.
- Yes. You are being detained. You're actually
under arrest, OK? Can I actually ask why? I'm going to tell
you all that right now. But first, I'm going to
advise you of your rights, OK? You understand you have
the right to remain silent? Anything you say-- [inaudible]. We'll get everyone out. Yeah. WOMAN: Can I ask why though? Yeah, yeah. OK, so the reason you're
being placed under arrest is for that shoplifting you did
at the Albertson's, all right? I have you on camera. I watched a camera video. You were stuffing
stuff in your backpack, and then you took off
in that car, all right? So-- So it's just for a theft? Yeah, yeah. So like I-- I thought it was only a ticket. But you ran away. All right, have a seat. Please. Who's the car for? WOMAN: [inaudible] my
license was stolen. Relax, relax,
relax, relax, relax. Take a deep breath. Relax. Relax. Have I been mean or anything? Relax, relax, relax. Relax, relax, relax. Listen, take some deep breaths. Relax, OK? What's the cat's name? Her name is Beans. Beans? Yeah. Like can of beans? That's a cool name. I like that. Is there anything
illegal in the car? - [inaudible].
- OK. Would you have a
problem if I search? No, not at all. OK, all right. Who is he to you? That is her brother. OK. It appears she was trying
to stuff at something. So we got consent to search. So we're just going to clear,
make sure it wasn't anything major, and get her
ticket taken care of, of our shoplifting complaint. Part of a meth pipe. OFFICER: There you go. OFFICER: I got not
to detain them, but-- OFFICER: Oh, there you go. OFFICER: What is it? OFFICER: Check it out. OFFICER: What? OFFICER: Money. OFFICER: Surprise, surprise. OFFICER: I thought
it was a little odd. OFFICER: You think
it's for Beans? We found her pipe collection. OFFICER: Just be careful
with that glass, man. OFFICER: What's that
look like to you? Is it meth or coke? Honestly, it goes
a long way, right? So, I found your little hiding
compartment in there, OK? I found a little hiding
compartment where all the pipes and the narcotics were, OK? OK, so who's it for? It's not Beans the cat, right? So who's it for? What's that? OK. WOMAN: What are you doing? Why are you arresting me? Relax, relax. Stop, stop, stop. So, listen, I found
your little stash. Stop, stop. I found your little stash. I found your pipes
and your narcotics. It looks like it's a little
bit of meth, some pills. Right next to where
you're sitting, where it peels off the center console? OK, OK.
Hang tight. Hang tight. WOMAN: I was scared of what he
would do if I didn't hide it. So-- She's saying the fiance
told her to hide it. Yeah, but she's acknowledging
what color the bag is and stuff like that.
So-- That's her all day. Yeah. At the very least we know
she had it at one point. She had all the [inaudible]. You basically have a
confession at that point. Yeah, yeah. We know for sure she had
it at one point in time, and she was hiding it. And she was able to
describe and detail everything that was in there. So we have enough to
make an arrest on her. If district courts wants
to pursue anything on them, they can. But for tonight, she's
going to take the ride. [inaudible] Hold on, Beans.
No, Beans. Beans, no. It's raining. MAN: [inaudible]. I know, man. Little foot pursuit
with Beans the cat. Did he understand you or what? Yeah. I have illegal
sunscreening tints. The reason I'm stopping
you, you got the tint on the back windows,
which is fine. But this front, it's illegal. Not in the front windows. You can have the back windows. This is the privacy glass
and the back windshield. I mean, I'm not-- I'm not going to give you
a super hard time about it. But if you get stopped, or
you go to get an inspection, they're not going to pass it. OK, you can roll that
back down a little bit. MAN: All right. SUVs are allowed privacy
glass in the back two Windows and the rear windshield,
whereas a car does not allow that at all. But he's good on the
front two windows, which no vehicle can have. Plus, I smelled a descent amount
of weed come from the car. Now, do you have
any weed in the car that you don't know of
or maybe your friend has? Because the car stinks. Your eyes are bloodshot. I want to make-- so listen to me. First off, I want to make
sure you're OK to drive. I can't. If I could ask everyone
if they were fine, we'd have a lot of issues. You can leave that
inside the car. All right. Now do you have anything on
you that I need to know about? Any weapons? Do you mind if i just
pat you down quick? All right, just turn around. I'm just going to
pat you down quick. You can put your
hands on your back. I'm not handcuffing you. I just want to make sure you
don't have anything sharp. Sorry. No guns or knives on you? Now, what's in here? What's that? OK, I can feel it. It feels like-- That is a
non-anatomical bulge. OK.
OK. Do me a favor. Stand over here. Just you can have a seat
on the bumper right there. Nothing in your waistband? OK, do me a favor. Go stand over on
that push bar for me. All right. Oh, so that's a pretty
good size bag of weed. That was in this bag here. OK, stay in the car. Don't-- so now-- keep your legs in the car. So what's the deal with the
bag in the back, the marijuana? All right, so you're going
to take ownership for it? Do you know much
about is in there? If you had to guess? Hold on. So give me your best. I was just curious. OK, because-- [inaudible] All right. All right. Just sit tight. [inaudible] . Looks like it could
be maybe a half pound. Not really good math guy. But the main thing
is it's significantly more than personal
possession of personal use. So let me get a
supervisor over here. He'll take some photographs. How many people does it
take to look at this. I'm chilling. No resisting. You know what I'm saying? But he's holding me down
tight, like he's tough. [inaudible] You got it? Get the camera on my face. Ain't no camera. Search. Yeah, he searched me, fool. He ain't no rookie. Yeah. That dude's on point. This is the dude you need
because he's always on my ass harassing me. I explained why I stopped you. No, you didn't. He said you got tint. That's not a way to
stop somebody, fool. It is illegal. It's not illegal. It's illegal to search
someone without asking them or even having a reason to. It smells like weed. Where's the dog at? No bueno. He's not here. So it's not going to cut, buddy. So good luck. Have a seat in the car. I will. But yo, roll down this window
more and I'll stop talking. [inaudible] All right. Thank you. All right. I'm stopping this vehicle
here for modifying exhaust. It's emitting a loud noise. Hey. How y'all doing? [interposing voices] You have your driver's
license with you? MAN: Not on me, sir. OK. Do you have a driver's license? MAN: Yes, sir. OK, you do?
My name is Trooper Bunch. I'm with the OHP. The reason I stopped you is
for your modified exhaust. And also, you have a
defective windshield here. Do you have an ID on you, sir? MAN: Not on me, sir. Sir, if you would come
on back to my car, please? MAN: Yes, sir. Just have a seat on the
front seat of my truck. MAN: Yes, sir. Your first name
and your birthday. 1/23/95. So that's not
pulling up anything. I swear that's what-- what it is, sir. You sure you gave
me the right birthday? I'm pretty sure I did. You're pretty sure you did? Yes, sir, because
I have actually-- I build cell phone
towers for a living. I travel. I'm actually home because
I got hit in the head with a crane ball. So I just have a slight
headache at the moment. But my birthday is 1/23/95. Oh, did you?
OK, hey, man. It's fine. Just tell me. So what-- OFFICER: Is it the same name? MAN: Robert. Hey, just relax, brother. That's not it either. MAN: I swear. OFFICER: So you
forgot your birthday? MAN: Sir, I don't even
really know my address. I've had a concussion, sir. I do. OFFICER: I'm just trying
to figure out who you are. MAN: Yes, sir. Yes, sir. This guy's telling me
two different birthdays and his name. He's in the front seat here. I just need to get
his ID real quick. What's going on, man? MAN: How are you doing, sir. If you're lying about who you
are, we're about to find out. So are you lying? No, sir. As far as I remember, no, sir. As far as you remember? I've got a concussion, sir. I don't know what else to say. [inaudible] I have low blood
sugar right now. It back to a
completely different name and date of birth. So we're going to run
him, make sure he's not got any warrants, his
driver's license is valid, and go from there. All right, step out
of the car, please. Yes, sir. Kick your shoe off. Kick this shoe off. Step back. Good. Take your sock off. Other sock off. That's stuck on my heel, sir. There we go. OK, now you're under arrest
for possession of CDS. That was in your shoe. Yes, sir. Sure was. We'll field test that
for methamphetamine. It's what it appears to be like. This should come
back blue if it's positive for methamphetamines. You can see that the
color on that's blue, which confirms
that this is meth. Whose backpack is this? OK, we got another
loaded firearm. Right now, our suspect
is at the hospital being cleared for his
medical condition. Then we're going to transport
him to the Oklahoma County jail where he'll be charged
with possession of CDS, possession of a firearm after
former felony conviction, and the reason for
the stop, which was a defective windshield
and a modified exhaust.",22:09
9mhOJggoa_Q,Throttle House,Automobile,R34 Nissan Skyline GT-R V-Spec II Review // The Holy Grail Of JDM,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mhOJggoa_Q,2 years ago,1.9M views,Automobile,"normally on throttle house we start with a unique intro of some kind but today is different because this marks the one-year point that James and I have been doing throttle house together so we wanted to make use of this moment to feature something a little bit special there aren't many cars out there that get to be called a living legend the r34 GTR is one of them and it comes in the form of an all-wheel drive racing bred turbocharged savage ask a cloaked man on any street corner about it and he'll regale you with tales of tuning and modification of supercar annihilation and a legion of racing wins the one we have today is a stock motor GTR in respect to form which we'll talk about in a minute and if Thomas placed the order correctly we might see in our 35 that's been overnighted from Japan later in the video but back to this because perhaps the most significant part of GTR history is that it was a favorite of the late Paul Walker he contributed to the cars fame like no one else could his contributions however didn't end there and off-screen Paul was a dedicated humanitarian he started an organization called reach out worldwide after he went to provide aid to the victims of the earthquake in Haiti since then it's grown into a hugely successful humanitarian effort with Paul's brother Cody at the helm who when he found out we were featuring RO in this video was kind enough to send us this message yo what's up you guys hey first and foremost James and Thomas I just gotta admit I've been a longtime viewer of your channel and it's just been so awesome to see you guys grow so fast in such little time you guys are cranking it out and it's top-notch stuff and I loved every second of it I just want to thank you guys so very much for featuring reach out worldwide today on your channel Paul founded almost 10 years ago to help communities stricken by natural disasters around the world and they continue to do so and they're able to do so because of the wonderful supporters and the supporters in the kart community like you guys so if anyone wants to learn more about the charity that Paul founded it's called reach out worldwide there's a link in the description below if you choose the support that would be wonderful otherwise I hope you guys enjoy the episode and Thomas James keep killing boys Wow all 34 leads the offbeat thing too this has the perfect amount of power and I'm saying on the right side of the car the correct side of the car immediately this is just such a special place to be everything's canted towards the driver and I've got lots of information on my screen right there which looks like it's from the error that it is now this has a twin-turbo inline six with independent throttle bodies that means the throttle response is very good and there's hardly any turbo lag I mean we say that for modern cars and it's getting tired but for a car from this era that's so so impressive it really is it runs to 8,000 rpm through its twin-turbo six cylinders I love the way the boost just rolls in the power the gears are so tall you're in the gears forever I think this is the first turbocharged car I've ever driven that revs as high as 8,000 rpm tons of power in second gear and third and this is smoke power it didn't take us very long to realize that in a world of electric and over assisted cars vehicles like the r34 start to feel really necessary immediately the car feels so analog I saw James rippin down here just no fear and you want to know why it's because the steering is so good honestly it's the steering just off-center it's immediate feel of the front wheels and when you get it in the middle of the corner I'm feeling every bump and undulation it gives you so much confidence and oh my god if I missed good steering like this I'm shocked at how well sorted this fills in the corners its confident it's tight I don't normally expect to feel this from a car from 2001 and these seats are unbelievable I'm bolstered in beautiful on the corners and yet still so comfortable this r34 in particular has been upgraded with ohlins dampers inspired by Nismo zone Clubman race spec and it's pretty much perfect but it just for the confidence here in the corners it's really really well sorted that you can point the front end like those lean and there's there's indications that the car is from the era that it is but honestly I take this type of experience over what we're getting nowadays because this just feels really special I'm shocked at how much the horsepower and this feels completely adequate if not more than I need it still feels light around the corners it feels like the suspension is unbelievable this doesn't feel nearly as old as I thought it would does it feel old in some ways yes the road noise is bad but that doesn't matter because when you push it it gives you so much back I know everyone mods these but I've never driven one fully stocked like this and I don't think I would it's fun as it hits at a hundred and fifty grand though which is what you'd have to pay to get something like this interesting value proposition however does it look 150 grand James and I are gonna go talk about that Oh special day it's something very familiar get out of the car this side yeah what's a beautiful colour this is so for anyone that knows GTRs you know that the v-spec - looks a little bit different - this because this has the Z tuned kid this is what it used to look like and this is what it looks like now and I think you and I can both agree it's all the better for it it's so much unbelievably III love this hood especially this is carbon fibre okay there's a lot of actual stuff going on air comes in here it comes out here and it comes out on these little muscular shoulder things yeah it's so good that's off the racecar yeah so cool it looks unbelievable actually the whole car is perfectly proportional to presence my favorite part though are these limited run Ray's l M TT 4 wheels they look incredible and they complete the look yeah they're fantastic this wing obviously this is adjustable a little bit carbon-fiber on there yes so there's the mismo stuff going on yes CQ and stuff and ever it is it was it's perfect yeah I I love the look of this car should we talk about the interior yes okay welcome to 2001 in the best way possible yeah well the owners realized that because he hasn't even changed anything in here this is completely stock its Sony although we do have this calculator that's a turbo timer turbo timer yes it's hot the turbos so what it does is it keeps everything running for a few seconds after the engine turns out to keep oil running to your turbos to increase their life and longevity but less boring okay that's really cool okay these seats are unbelievably amazing yes and well this is the v-spec - so it's actually a slightly different interior I think seats are the same but the design of the cloth and the colors these are so danke like I'm gonna dwell on it because like stood like the type bar the new type r is the only thing I've driven that has seats that are this comfortable and bolstered by the way that balance is i TV well actually so you get to see seven engine statistics running as you drive that's pretty cool for the arrogant m3 from the same era has no information well you could also set the the shift for the revs for when the red light comes on which shift which revs you wanted to shift the shifts no you nailed that yeah I'm not good at working this CBS I don't think it works in Canada but if I could tune it to one punch man and drive my er I would yeah gauge cluster is so cool variable gt-r Nismo steering wheel it is nothing else other than a steering wheel which I appreciate very much yeah this is very much more honestly though this is super super cool and oh guess what our our 35 is here not service right that is service we go oh alright thank you yes you're gonna run back to Japan it's got long legs the r35 there is still the newest generation of a monster at all city destroying one at that it now makes five hundred and sixty-five horsepower and 467 pound-feet of torque this 50th anniversary edition costs one hundred and forty thousand dollars Canadian that's almost sixty thousand dollars more than when it came out ten years ago alright gt-r launch control head back to this day that is still the most shocking launch control of any car [Music] to the face oh yes it's quick but what else can it do twin-turbo v6 hand-built Oh huge amounts of boost they actually turned up the boost a couple years ago give it a little bit more power than in the first couple years of the r35 so there's more power up but I mean you can put a software tune in an old one and do the exact same thing so the power is immediate and a very serious it's just such a frantic engine unless you have an aftermarket exhaust er some intakes doesn't actually sound that cool I mean it just kind of sounds like a v6 a little bit of whooshing noises I almost want more out of it that's like Tesla Model 3 performance quick and that's immediately wearing let yourself down that is appalling steering there is more feedback in my PlayStation draw shock controller the moment you get off center it just disappears it's like someone's turned it off I have no idea where the front wheels are it's such a shame because the steering rules like the best-looking steering wheel on the business it looks like it's been taken out something like God of War it looks like a hammer like a weapon that you unlock at the end of the game alright you've probably heard journalists say in the past this feels like driving a video game that's a phrase that is difficult what does that mean I'm gonna explain it to you really really quickly this car does everything for you it creates colossal g-forces and the all-wheel drive system is incredibly advanced so it kind of just puts the power to whatever wheel needs it but the thing for me that makes it feel very sterile inert is the steering as soon as you get past Center you feel the power steering pump kick end and the steering is dead lifeless nothing there is nothing to it and I dislike that greatly especially after getting out of the r34 which had honestly some of the best steering I've driven in a long time even better than my e46 m3 this feels like nothing it ruins a lot of the drive for me that isn't to say that there isn't a unique novelty to the car when you really push it you can feel the system's working moving power around it and generating grip where there should be none and that alone in its own way makes it fun but compared to certain cars it doesn't feel as pure like say I don't know and r34 GTR wasn't just an experience that car it was an education it was a time warp in such a good way this is not the first time we compared old versus new on throttle house and when we compared them the offers we were overjoyed about how much the nd captured the magic of the original one and I can't say the same for these and that's upsetting but one place that it does impress me is its styling it's still a GTR it is it drives very differently to the r34 though so differently yeah maybe not in a good way maybe not okay this is the 50th anniversary how much do you think it costs to get this badging in the blue and the stripe I'm the interior stuff and the interior stuff don't undersell it say ten grand nine gran gran gran well done as a percentage of MSRP not crazy I said number in and of itself quite a lot squalor money and it it gets you some weird little things here no there's a lot of 50th anniversary stuff on the inside but we've got these wheels with this weird blue thing that looks like a reflection of the body paint until you look up close that's not and then it's just not good this has this big white stripe on the front which looks awesome I think it looks like a Camaro stripe from a little bit a little bit it's a little bit American actually yeah but overall the shape of this is I think it looks great yes Nissan are very good at making timeless looking cars yeah which is much to their benefit because they don't update them ever all right back end well this is where the 50th anniversary gets a bit hairy because it only says 50th anniversary in one location here which ya know except for the bit that's been pulled off a party balloon and stuck on I was just gonna pretend that wasn't there yeah well you could because you should rip this off if you immediately look horrible other than that super badass you got these tips here yeah carbon fiber alright interior the colour is very good it's nice it's relaxing it's calming yes it actually it really really is yeah um so this Alcantara stuff up here is part of the 50th anniversary edition so is the fact that it says 50th anniversary on the thing but that's a very size is the most subtle of all things not that proud of 50 years also 50th anniversary comes with an Alcantara steering wheel this is an option with it which is probably for the best I guess longer otherwise this has not changed that much there was an update a few years ago for this area here but going with the cushy seats though still they're too narrow though things that are too narrow they're nice but they're too narrow on the on the lower back yeah they are they hold hold you in very well make you that you make they make you know you've just had lunch exactly upsetting way the gauge cluster is cool-looking but kind of old looking it's all been father look well you don't see that at night actually I speaking of at night these buttons on the steering wheel here are so dim at night that you can't even see them there might be a way to turn it up the cluster illumination adjuster doesn't only does the cluster doesn't do these it's super dark oh this is so cool it looks very very good steering wheel no honestly it's it's fine it is it is outdated well I don't find it that bad the trouble is is if you got out of this and go into I don't know a 9 9 to 9 is the same price you'd be like oh oh yeah that's what cars can look like at this price yeah it's hard to argue with that I mean otherwise it's pretty cool you got all the tech in here and there's a functionality if like it shows you all the information of your engine obviously these toggle switches are like like you feel like such a hero playing with these buttons like to go into launch control mode yeah you just look good eliminate red is so cool otherwise I mean there's a lot of stuff in here that I remember from my 2008 Nissan Altima so don't claim that all right first of all too weird flags it literally is the same I promise it is so is the key actually we should do a conclusion outside the car because like there's some important stuff to talk about with this car yep all right we need to talk we need to do yes one year and you're breaking up with me already yeah fiftieth anniversary this is a lot of money 140 grand that's a lot that is a lot of money yeah what can you get for a hundred grand you can get we've said a 99 to 911 already engage et yes you can get our m5 competition and our 34 to our thirty fives used yeah and one of them would be tuned GTR is supposed to be the sub hundred K card destroys hundred K plus cars and now this is a 100 K plus way over and the Nismo is even more than is insanely expensive it's a tough buy I'm not sure that I can recommend this particular car spend 150 grand on our 34 though if I was like steeped in JDM Lord yes and money and money yeah I don't have either of those things but I would I think I was that felt like a really really special car was epic it was really really cool this is still awesome but if you're gonna buy an r35 right now buy a used one and tune it all right let's do this and also great about this what we've avoided thus far we still haven't got a say subscribe because this lady says it for you is that what she says I've no idea",16:59

6VHdJhSVwTU,TheStraightPipes,Automobile,I Bought the Cheapest and Highest Mileage Ford Raptor in the WORLD,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VHdJhSVwTU,2 years ago,1.3M views,Automobile,"[Music] I'm Jakob hearing and I'm buying my Ford Raptor hopefully potentially yes so we're going to check out the first Ford Raptor I haven't checked out any other Raptors yet so this may be the one but by the title of this video you will already know if I bought it or not how many miles does this one have Jacob this one has three hundred and fifty thousand kilometers two hundred and twenty thousand miles and how much is it listed for listed for about twenty four thousand dollars however we have already negotiated a price prior to seeing it and it is much better than that I'll get to that later why not now $18,500 canadian and an american that's this at today's exchange rate and for all you yuri fanboys out there thinking where's Yuri's Prowler I'm working on it prowlers take a little more time than Raptors to find and none of this will be possible without you guys thank you for watching watching is the number one thing you could do to help us buy cars that's it because we make money off youtube ads exactly and now we can buy cars to make more content yes we can and poor decisions that's right and some of you might be upset in the comments saying you've seen a higher mileage raptor however your Raptor is not for sale so this is the highest mileage Raptor in North America for the cheapest price currently probably theoretically in the world as well yeah I'm not really sure where else they sell Raptors so this is not clickbait this is actually an accurate video title alright Jacob tell the viewers why you picked this Raptor to look at first there was three things first the price it fit into my price category second it had the 6.2 liter engine and third the color I wanted orange and specifically orange on orange interior with the Raptor graphics exactly and the 6.2 liter is a naturally aspirated v8 absolutely because the new Raptors are twin turbo v6 s yes and I don't want that one even though I like that body style and first gen Raptors also had a 5.4 liter v8 ya rijal II so this one comes with a six point two which was optional for 2010 it was a $3,000 option in 2011 and anything newer than that you could no longer get the 5.4 next bonus part about this Raptor old man driven highway miles old gentleman old gentleman driven highway miles technically he says it's never been jumped and he hasn't put it in any off-road modes or used the paddles or shifting yes so he claims and I tend to because this is a 70 year old gentleman that bought it when he was 61 brand-new original owner he claims he has never pressed the off-road button so as much as the image of the Raptors jumping I want one that's been driven on the highway and not jumped because I want to potentially jump it so we've looked at other Raptors online some people even include a photo of them jumping it yeah and in the sand dunes and stuff like that right come on bro we know what you're doing yeah and the first question I ask people is like how far did you jump it and if they come back with theirs response saying like a distance I don't there's no more questions for me like I'm done and how worried are you that this has three hundred fifty thousand kilometers on the engine slightly worried but not that worried I watched this whole documentary I'll put the link in the description the Ford engineer for this engine said that this engine is bulletproof and should last forever which put some very durable components in it it should be bullet perfect Shimron forever and I'm gonna hold you to that for it engineer guy we're gonna find you on LinkedIn we're gonna look you up hopefully you're still at Ford maybe you're at nice and Manor and Mazda what we don't know about Ford SVT which turned into Ford Performance how about accidents and oil change records and stuff okay so he sent me the CARFAX it is very clean one owner no accidents he said that he changed the oil every 5000 kilometers which is exactly what I want so I can't even add up how much this guy spent and oil changes alone for 300 clobbers that's a lot of money and did you notice anything funny when you're looking at pictures of the car absolutely nothing except the rear bumper is grown now what was his excuse for that so I asked him about that he actually complimented me for being very observant he said he got a quote for the original Raptor bumper to be replaced for $1000 because it had a little rust bubble on it and he's like I'm not paying $1,000 for this little part so he got a chrome one for four hundred and seventy five dollars but that makes me think like why wouldn't you just leave it because it has a rust bubble this guy cares that much I that is what I respect we haven't seen this yet we're gonna go check it out at a dealership again I think they're gonna do a pre inspection look at it yeah I got a dealer pre-inspection setup because I want to make sure this is all good because it's a very high mileage and then if all checks out Jacobs gonna buy this Raptor we're gonna drive it back to Toronto my mechanic is gonna safety it if they can fit on his voice yeah or it might already be safety we don't even know that yet because it might just pass the safety at Ford and what's the tipping point for not buying this vehicle okay so we've already agreed to a price now that's assuming that there's not too many things wrong with it so my tipping point is about three thousand dollars so if it needs more than three thousand dollars in work and he doesn't budge on the price any more I will not buy this one now let's talk about why we love for two Raptors because I love for Raptors to you love for Raptors a little more because you actually want to buy one yeah so I don't like or love any other trucks I'm driving a tundra TRD pro right now and that's great but I don't want to own it I only want to own a Ford Raptor I don't want a regular f-150 just a raptor now I saw this one my buddy's cousin drove me in it it was the first 6.2 liter in Canada so he claimed 2010 yes and so he took me for a drive in it I was blown away I was like what is this thing like what is this monster truck I did not care about trucks whatsoever until that moment for me it's that Raptor jump that Raptor jump just sealed the deal that this is the coolest thing in the world we should actually find that guy and see if he got a free Raptor as a replacement for that for all that free marketing they got yeah I hope you got a free Raptor out of that that was worth it are you gonna jump here like that I don't know if I can afford it one day when does when it's the retirement party for it we'll we'll try to get him to jump his wraps are over my Prowler that's the ultimate goal yes well one % do that if the ramp is all good everything's all good I will jump your problem and the coolest part about that documentary that I mentioned earlier so Ford wanted to race this in the Baja 1000 to prove that it's a baja truck is nothing like this has been done before so the coolest part of that was them saying that there was actually an SVT Lightning in the works before they made the Raptor but they couldn't beat the performance of the first gen lightning because it was that good so they're like why don't we just make a baja truck I guess you can't deny that no one's done it before so this was pretty cool because they're like well we either blow it or it's a huge success and it turned out to be a huge success I got to watch that documentary if you buy this Raptor I'll watch the documentary all right it's about two hours yeah I don't whine bro all I do is like watch youtube all day it's really good so basically they race this truck they got third place in Baja for the stock class it was not 100 percent stock I had to have a roll cage welded in the engine was like slightly modified to have 500 horsepower but that's about it everything else was pretty stock and it lasted so we're almost at the Raptor which is two hours away from Toronto now we're gonna go through the inspection process and hopefully we have a raptor by the end this is the first time I will be seeing it so we'll take you through that whole process but you probably already know if we bought it or not because it's probably been scattered throughout the intro and everything but it's got to be pretty fun to watch us live it forward but we don't know we don't know if it yeah at this point I haven't even seen it so what's the plan man hit the bank get a certified check yep that's it Jake I'll hold that up you're gonna trade that for a raptor yes where's the cheque jokes I don't see any Raptors I'm in a blue Toyota Tundra you can't really miss it he said he's in a 2018 f1 so it's got another 150 oh he's gonna come here to 30 seconds his raft is already in there probably baby I mean I mean your future right there yes Jacob is it everything you thought it'd be it's more than I thought it would be Jacob's first rip and his soon-to-be Orange Raptor this is crazy so this guy's never redlined it he's been putting shell 91 and it forever because he used to work for shell yep v-power all its life it's got 350 thousand kilometers it starts and currently we're getting a raptor kitten I wish the steering wheel is tell us oh that's my first good play I feel pretty good yeah brakes are a little wobbly yo let's do an original photograph to visor test should we do it now you don't gotta save something for the reveal wait till you buy it did you find out about the visors yeah I'm lyin anyways yeah we haven't even SPECT it yet we did a phone call with my mechanic Ben yes we did and he's pretty about it Oh full tank well Dan thank you Dan for the full tank of beef our sounds good so we've got all orange no infotainment but we have XM radio it's perfect we got our switches I'm a sunroof it works to add a little we got the little back window to check that out you got orange seats in the back little suicide doors perfect alright ready yeah all right first time it's been taking their headline ever this is the closest you can get to a rose for a surprise comedy you just float over everything do we get to keep all these loonies I think so part of the deal you drive a hard bargain Jacob drive yeah yeah you're liking this liking it so before we take it to the shop for a pre inspection I mean it's a really good condition yeah I support this decision was already the checks out right all right just like Richard Road I just bought her after that's a long walk [Music] dan is it okay if we have you in this video just waving by to us yeah deadly rules for us any rules for Jacob in the Raptor just daughter d'etre so no jumping no jumping okay awesome hey is it safe for everyone guys thank you so much [Music] all right so we just left just outside of London Ontario and I'm finally driving the Raptor for the first time as the new registered owner this is pretty wild I'm loving this so far it honestly drives like a brand new truck it's so comfortable it absorbs everything on the road I absolutely love this now the interior is a little bit disgusting because the person was a smoker Dan I love you you're a very good owner you're the first owner but a little bit dirty in here so I am going to get this professionally detailed at some point relatively soon because I need to and as you can see I have an orange interior with orange seats so this is the only option that you can get for this interior plus the navigation which this does not have and I am so glad that it does not have the screen because it would probably suck very much we have a little screen up here so this actually does have satellite radio no it does not rewind satellite radio but then being the gracious owner that he is he left me with the rest of his subscription to satellite radio so I am enjoying my hip hop nation let's talk about some first impressions how it drives I'm currently averaging 18 litres per 100 kilometers and that is absolutely brutal and I am on the highway so in the city it will be even worse and for you Americans here is that miles per gallon and this is exactly what I expected from the Raptor so you see the smile on my face I don't care now the most obvious point with this having 350,000 kilometers is that I'm a little bit nervous with the engine and transmission all that lasting but I have looked at a bunch of forum posts online people have had super duties with the same engine up to four hundred thousand five hundred thousand miles so at 350 thousand kilometers roughly about 220,000 miles this thing has plenty of life left in it now it does need some work I need to get the upper control arms replaced that should be about four hundred dollars aside plus the labor and then I also need to get all new brakes all around so that should be maybe around another five hundred dollars so about $1,000 ish maybe 1,100 1,200 to get this thing completely fixed and perfect condition plus the interior cleaning which probably will cost me kind of a pretty penny because there's a lot of cleaning that needs to happen I still can't believe that I'm driving this this feels very surreal I love the driving position in this I actually raised my seat for the first time because now I'm in a truck I want to feel like the king of the road and I do because I'm in an orange raptor this is hilarious to drive this truck is a joke it is so funny to look at it's orange on orange it looks like a toy truck it is amazing it is exactly what I wanted so far first hour I am very happy with my purchase Hey look there's there's URI we drove together in the tundra now here he's driving that home I'm driving the Raptor we got the brightest trucks on the road we basically on the road it's actually pretty hilarious and there he goes so we will do a full review on this URI will then get to drive it but I just want to explain that I got the exact spec that I wanted on one of the super cab with the short doors absolutely love this this is the most joke spec you can get orange on orange with the short doors and the raptor splash graphics and with all that out of the way we will continue to drive this continue updating you on everything with this truck I look forward to driving this for many miles and potentially sending it in the air so no jumping no jumping okay so don't forget to subscribe hit the notification bells so that you get updates on my Ford Raptor and our regular reviews as well follow the journey I'm so excited to have this car check out our patreon page and join our YouTube membership Rapture so I can't believe I actually did buy my Raptor there are some things wrong with it but I was able to negotiate the price so I actually got this for $18,000 now I'm gonna take it to URIs and my mechanic Ben gets a couple things fixed and then we'll resume the video there I'm picking out my Raptor just got it fixed we're at Dixie Bloor service they don't have a sign but that's Dixie that's blur you know you excited I'm so excited did we do alright though for picking a good one yeah tonight right it's a nice truck said by a mechanic yeah done plus it's a Ford a lot better than Dodger oh this is why he's my mechanic I give you a license to sand with this new new ver channel yeah you go it says 520 on the cap I put ten thirty in these things just because with the amount of miles it miles that are on it it's loosey-goosey you got a tire yeah it looks like the thicker road takes up a slack motor oh cool these things like thicker oil anyways the coolant was disgusting I took the bottle and I took I just fill it full of that purple power crap oh yeah let it sit overnight and that was snapchat that was disgusting yeah yeah snapchat mechanics that was Jacob was getting nervous yeah I was like another one like what does he think that's a Glee but it was all good every time and what about the rear step not happening yeah she's uh I don't think it's ever been used and so so would you say is a very manly truck Oh manly for sure you've had to buy the step because that was an option so it's to prove a point of how manly it is he bought it and then never never used it exactly and then the brakes are all good yeah just all the rotors and all the pads yeah yeah it's got also fresh brakes in it up any of the upper upper ball joint oh my god how much of a pain was that that was nasty yeah that was why was nasty because the one snap you sent us the bolt was mounted the opposite way yeah the bolt was the inside and if they went from the outside it'd be a lot easier but I think because even done before you can see somebody had done these before and I'm pretty sure the guy who did them was either the Hulk or you know he won the fight was girlfriend written for a day he's laying it on the bolts at home and that's pretty much it yeah if it was good yeah everything was good the front dip was nasty yes he's easy fella waterers yeah there was water in the front death on these trucks there's a vent hose that goes from the death up here and I think it mounts somewhere up on the valve covered okay and it's it's a vent hose the vent hose fell down and I think he must have got went like submerged it or something and it got water into the differential so when I drained the fluid it was it was way over filled and it was watering so I these trucks here you know differential services got the big cover on the back yeah I couldn't actually get the cover off of these because of how close the power steering rack is oh what you do is you pull the cover back I was able to scoop all the crap out of there yeah reseal that put it back on I filled it back up so on their invoice I showed you you should really do it again probably about 10 to 15 K just to make sure all that stuff's out of there it seems a lot to me like all those people who do like fixing cars on YouTube we would have no chance no no this would take like days Express that's why people have mechanics and stuff don't even have tools anymore yeah maybe Krista fix would help us a yeah keep the oil clean Oh a needs a belt but even you can have fun with that yourself you you're not that bad to do that's what I was looking at too cuz I notice a little bit of this I know you did the belt on your Lexus so that thing was harder to do than this so I feel really yeah yeah these were easy so both calipers need to be yeah the seasoning up yes well both lower slider pins on both were seized up I I took a torch to him I tried to get him to move they're not going to tell me how much is it caliper roughly for a raptor I don't same as the regular I flip it if it's the same as a regular one they're not that bad you know probably like 20 bucks apiece keep watching this video well thanks a lot zoom in on the logo one more time you need service fixie blur service that we were you located right here Dixie blue yeah Wow real creative yeah yeah America I'm Yuri I'm Jacob we're going for a drive drive right now subscribe we didn't even we didn't do that",19:04
thx9hVgrXhQ,TechLinked,"Tech,News","Apple, this is ridiculous.",0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thx9hVgrXhQ,4 months ago,967K views,"Tech,News",here it is guys you're here for it this is the tech noise tech noise tech noise that's right in the tech noise today apple unveiled the iphone 13 13 mini 13 pro and 13 pro max without mentioning the lightning port even once most likely out of shame they know what they did the whole lineup has a 20 smaller notch and bigger batteries with the lower tier phones getting hand-me-down cameras from last year's iphone 12 pro max to help with the new cinematic mode aka autofocus but with ai this time the 13 pro models got slightly fancier cameras with support for pro res video recording that's pretty sweet and a new one terabyte model to store all of that sizeable footage it should be noted though that the 128 gig pro model can only do 1080p 30 because presumably of storage limitations heaven forbid they just put an expansion slot on it the pro models also now have an adaptive 120 hertz pro motion display but come on would you rather have that for a thousand bucks or the new ipad mini which has the same a15 bionic chip 5g pencil support and freaking usbc for 650 i mean it's the big phone apple should have made for same apple there was also an updated 9th gen ipad and the new apple watch series 7 featuring a bigger screen and a nice swipe keyboard that was almost certainly copied from an accessibility app called flick type that apple forced to shut down not long before yesterday's event that's not anti-competitive those guys could they could just make their own smart watch speaking of competition xiaomi released some compelling products to compete with apple in the form of the xiaomi 11t and 11t pro complete with fast processors super fast charging 120hz display 5 000 milliamp hour batteries and 108 megapixel main cameras launching these the day after apple's event was already going to draw some comparisons but the new pad 5 made sure of it it's an android tablet that not only looks very much like an ipad it might also be a decent android tablet which that feels just what xiaomi also one-upped facebook this week with the announcement of its smart glasses which apparently have an optical waveguide display in the right lens in addition to cameras mounted on the arms i mean did you see this tim apple xiaomi is pulling ahead because you guys won't put usbc on your phones they can play fortnite on the glasses come on tim facebook is probably content to let xiaomi steal their smart glasses spotlight though thanks to a report from the wall street journal that found that studies conducted by instagram concluded that the social media platform almost certainly contributes in some way to higher levels of anxiety and depression in teens the report criticizes the facebook-owned platform for knowing about the study's conclusion since 2019 but not making them available to the public in response instagram said that the studies were proof that they were trying to understand the effects their platform has on teens and isn't that good enough no you just you just don't you just don't understand me i'm running away and this time i mean it in an apparent effort to get in front of similar criticism tick tock has now rolled out warnings that will appear in front of potentially distressing content which teens will definitely pay attention to uh also a separate wall street journal report identified millions of vip facebook users that were allowed to break the platform's rules with no consequences because of their follower accounts so you know the right thing to do come over to twitter which is the super mentally healthy social media app yeah we're great now it's time for quick bits brought to you by storyblocks and its massive library of stock footage images audio and after effects templates which we use in almost every techlinked episode because it's great and also we don't know how to take the camera off the tripod it just got stuck i don't want to talk about it storyblocks recently launched the restock initiative to make content that more accurately reflects our world so they've hired new bipac and lgbtqia plus filmmakers to create authentic stock content depicting underrepresented communities they've got affordable subscriptions with unlimited video and audio downloads so check out storyblocks today at storyblocks.com techlinked and we're back quick banks nutritious and ready in just one second by the time this video goes live spacex will have probably already launched the first private flight to space crewed entirely by private citizens not currently affiliated with the military or a space agency like nasa i mean yeah richard branson and jeff bezos flew sub-orbital flights that lasted a few minutes but these people will be orbiting the earth for three days hopefully raising 200 million dollars for st jude children's hospitals in the process from from the humans on earth that's where the money will come from i'm pretty sure that they don't think they're going to find money in space but i've never been up there so to say there's that asteroid that's like worth trillions of dollars microsoft is now allowing you to ditch the password on your microsoft account completely instead microsoft will let you use the microsoft authenticator app on your phone windows hello or a physical security key to sign in this is honestly great because passwords suck every password it sucks mine mine is all numbers and special characters it takes like 14 minutes to type it sucks that sounds good after requiring apple to allow third-party payment options in the ios app store the country which country has now turned its sites on google fining the tech giant 177 million us dollars for abusing its mobile dominance by suppressing forks of the android operating system imagine south korea caring about a google not allowing forks of the android operating system gee i wonder where that criticism came from excuse me it's only the latest development in the antitrust craze that's sweeping the globe i mean all the cool kids are talking about monopolies these days there's there's tick-tock dances about breaking up facebook for crying out loud four years after its launch nintendo seemingly remembered that the nintendo switch has bluetooth so they have finally released an update enabling support for bluetooth audio although some users are experiencing no you know what i will talk about this later nintendo you can update things mario party for the switch great game lots of fun lots of fun but but there's no way to turn off the tutorial when you play the board game you have to sit through the tutorial every no time me finish you have to sit through it every time no matter if you know the rules and there's these long animations i just want to play the board game it stretches out to take twice as long just make them  skippable nintendo [Music] now some users are experiencing some glitches including audio delays and slow boot times after receiving the update so maybe there was a reason nintendo didn't enable the feature up until now but hey uh doing it out of spite also wouldn't really be out of character for them and vr is fine but you have to stand up or at best sit down to play it come on give me a vr headset like the half dive which is the world's first vr system designed to be used while lying down yes this is probably going to be used for sexy vr things but it could also be really good for people with disabilities who otherwise aren't able to enjoy vr either way looks like an incredible way to fight back against the idea that vr games are also going to be exercise even just a little bit of it because it's terrible there should be no exercise at all and it would be wrong to continue this episode so come back on friday for more tech noise don't worry these are dead these are dead will we include the mario party bit i don't know,8:33
QQh56geU0X8,Top Gear,"Automobile,Comedy",Rolling a Reliant Robin - Top Gear - BBC,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQh56geU0X8,11 years ago,29M views,"Automobile,Comedy","Here we go. Reliant Robin. Oh, no. I've crashed it.
I've crashed it almost immediately. I mean, literally, 20 feet. I can't get out, obviously.
I'm completely stuck. Luckily, people in the North of England
are friendly and keen to help out. Excuse me! Excuse me... Oh heavens, look who it is!
It's Phil Oakey. Do you think you can
push me back on my wheels? -Yeah, certainly.
-Thanks very much. Thank you, so much. Thank you very much,
Phil Oakey, out of the Human League! Pleasure. I suppose, as a Sheffield boy,
Phil Oakey spent a lot of his youth putting Robin Reliants
back on their wheels, when he wasn't rescuing
waitresses from cocktail... Help! Again! Help! Where's Martin Fry out of ABC
when you need him? That's a... useful feature. In the early days,
the Robin had a 750cc engine. With 32 brake horse power on tap,
nought to 50 took 22 seconds. Nought to 60... wasn't really possible. In 1975 though,
Reliant fitted an 850cc engine. This improved the acceleration enormously,
but the consequences were catastrophic. The lamppost! The big engine increased
the top speed, too. It would now do 85. And that was catastrophic as well. Not again! Oh no! I'm 50 years old.
I'm on my side on a street in Sheffield. Oh, is that the sound of somebody? Hello? He... Peter Stringfellow! Were you just walking by, or... Oh, nearly! Yes! Thank you so much, Peter Stringfellow
out of lap dancing clubs. -My pleasure.
-Really, I can't thank you enough. To try and understand why
the Robin was so popular up north, I pulled over to chat to some enthusiasts. -How do you drive a Reliant?
-Straight lines. You don't go round roundabouts. You get to it and you see where you're
coming off and you go straight across. -Right.
-Try to avoid t'hill in t'middle. -I can't...
-Cement on the passenger seat. -Cement?
-Yeah, sack of cement on t'passenger seat. Helps the balance it. Why do you think Reliant owners
have big tool boxes? To weigh it down.
I was going to say... your teeth. Did you lose these in a Reliant accident?
You did, didn't you? Why do you think, everybody,
Reliants were so popular in t'North? -A lot of miners used them.
-But why? Because they were more expensive
than Minis. Because a lot of miners
originally started with motorbikes and they didn't have
a full driving licence. So, to get out of t'weather in winter,
when it were absolutely siling it down, they bought a Reliant. So, it was just because miners
didn't have a driving licence? Some of them, but other ones...
also in t'winter, with them being light, you'd get your normal car
stuck in t'snow or whatever. -These just simply glide over t'top of it.
-Until you get to a corner! Well, long as you live somewhere
with a straight line to t'pit. Soon, I was back on my perilous journey. In this, it feels like I'm driving through
South Yorkshire in the 1970s, again. I grew up not far from here,
so did James May, for that matter. When I were a lad round 'ere,
all t'rich people, them as could afford four wheels
on the car, they all had Ladas. Lah-de-dahs we called them.
You didn't want to hit one of them, I'll tell you that for nowt.
They were built like tanks. One of the best ways to protect
your Robin was to lavish it with an exotic paint job,
such as this Starsky And Hutch homage. The idea was that having spent
many hours with the spray cans and the masking tape,
you'd drive more carefully. But this didn't always work. It really is a wonder how anyone
in the North survived the 1970s. Of course, a lot didn't. In 1971, the population of Sheffield
was 573,000. Since then, it's dropped to just 513,000. Some of the lost 60,000 moved south,
of course. But many, many, many more
were wiped out by their three-wheelers. Today, of course,
most of the Robins are gone and people up here
drive Kias and Hyundais instead. And this means the local TV news channel
has to think of things other than Reliant crashes
to put in its bulletins. Okay, to Braithwell in South Yorkshire now and a blooming mystery that's baffling
its green-fingered residents. Harry is there for us.
Harry, what's going on? Welcome here to beautiful Braithwell. You can see the sun exploding
on a kaleidoscope of colour. And I have to say, there's been
a real area of controversy here, because over the last few days... My God! -Are you all right, sir?
-Yeah, I'm getting used to it now, thanks. -Oh.
-Thanks, very much. If you could just pop me
back on the wheels. Thank you, so much. Thank you, Harry Grayson,
out of Look North. Pleasure. Thank you, so much.",7:33
_Kav2K1DVWo,Barely Sociable,Informative,The Most Elusive Identity On The Internet - Pt. 1 (Ft. Nexpo),0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Kav2K1DVWo,2 years ago,1.5M views,Informative,"[Music] [Music] thousands of people would like to know who really created Bitcoin so who made that when you asked about the Creator who created us who invented this they must be real genius everyone's like we have no idea were you able to learn anything more about who Satoshi Nakamoto is you're taking a look at Bitcoin whole rally mode today you're right about that romain at this point bitcoin is up about 20% if you can believe it and over the last 150 trading days only one damn day look at that it's really pretty incredible 71% the Bulls thoroughly in charge after collecting over a billion dollars of people's investments just and disappeared into the wind now you did not lose $3,000 okay everyone listen up you didn't lose your money now you you have to technically you kind of lost your money [Music] it's most likely it's a fictitious name I don't know them no I don't even know his name [Music] [Music] by now and just about everyone has heard about Bitcoin it's a household name and in the short span of a decade cryptocurrency as a term has gone from obscurity all the way to the mainstream the creation of Bitcoin has fostered this entirely new world of financial discussion into this day and blockchain technology seeks to undermine a number of industries in the future whether you're a fan of the whole Bitcoin thing or not there is one thing almost all of us can agree on Bitcoin is legendary for the sheer number of insane stories that come out of its existence the first story that comes to mind for me with Bitcoin is the tale of the Gizmodo editor who threw away a hard drive with 7,500 Bitcoin on it this is both absolutely hilarious and tragic simultaneously by the time he realized it he had thrown away 7.5 million dollars and today it's worth around 54 million on the flip side of things you might be all too familiar with the stories of the Bitcoin millionaires who made good on their initial investments and held long enough that the words moon and Lambo had a new meaning all in all bitcoin as a whole has fostered this incredibly interesting community but when it comes to Bitcoin the most infamous story you've probably heard of is the rise and fall of the bit Connect Ponzi scheme we've all seen the ball dude yelling bit connect and in all honesty this topic deserves a video of its own time and time again and we've seen scandals of youtubers promoting things that are less than stellar and these are obviously in exchange for those sweet influencer dollars it's one thing to promote youtuber merchandise that's going to end up in all of the thrift stores and a couple of decades from now but selling your audience a Ponzi scheme that led to the loss of people's life savings is just another insane story from the Bitcoin realm the list goes on and on and on my channel previously we've only scratched the surface of the stories of the various darknet marketplaces and services all stemming from bitcoins creation all in all I must say the cryptocurrency community fascinates me with the Witter pumping dumps blackmail emails and major Bitcoin exchanges getting hacked there's so much chaos in the world of cryptocurrency that I can only really describe it as the Wild West but don't get it twisted I still believe that Bitcoin and blockchain technology is a great invention whenever there's something new and there's hype around it it takes time for it to grow out of its infancy we all know Bitcoin by now but despite us knowing all about it there is one thing that none of us know at the heart of bitcoins Genesis there is one internet mystery and that is just as grand a story as all of the others that mystery is the true identity of the creator of Bitcoin and it begins with one elusive online persona as many of you know already and that certain identity is mr. Satoshi Nakamoto in the 21st century it's practically impossible to have a global impact without at least putting your name out there yes Satoshi Nakamoto is an exception by all accounts the person behind this online persona was a genius and to this day no one knows who he is or what happened to him [Music] satoshi nakamoto is a pseudonym which is a fictitious name and this name is the author of the now famous white paper by the name of bitcoin appeared appear electronic cash system Satoshi was the catalyst to the creation of Bitcoin along with the help of various developers over time but to this day not a sliver of verifiable proof as to his real identity has been revealed the person behind this identity is believed to have been ahead of his time and had a comprehensive understanding of C++ coding economics and cryptography this unnamed billionaire is believed to be the owner of about a million Bitcoin that has remained untouched to this day something I should note is that this 1 Million number is a bit of a rumor it's widely speculated that much of the unspent coins within the first year of bitcoins mining belonged to Satoshi I would say that it's very likely that Satoshi owns a large sum but it's incredibly difficult to say exactly how much bitcoins Satoshi has stashed away this mysterious identity came out of nowhere and has thus created non-stop speculation in regards of what type of person could have been behind Bitcoin you might think that the creator of Bitcoin would have some end game where they would profit off of it yet Satoshi's actions thus far have pointed in the opposite direction not a single penny of the supposed fortune has ever been touched and due to the nature of how public blockchain transactions work we would know if this were to change at any given moment there are quite a few theories about why Satoshi hasn't spent any of his fortune so I'll take some time now to address some common theories some people believe that Satoshi is waiting for the perfect time to cash out while some optimists believe that Satoshi never intends on selling his fortune as a donation to the community there's a chance that Satoshi lost access to its Bitcoin which I will explain in more detail later some people believe that Satoshi is dead while others believe he wanted to retain his anonymity as we go forward I will elaborate on all of these theories much more I must say that this Satoshi debate has gone on for quite some time and by no means is his topic new many people have done their research into this subject but typically something I notice is that a lot of journalists who do videos or articles on this matter tend to pick a candidate and then work backwards I should mention that we are going to go over the list of popular candidates but for now I need to point something out the fact of the matter is that starting with a candidate in mind creates a sort of confirmation bias and doesn't give you the full picture of the online persona of Satoshi Nakamoto so instead when we get to my analysis I'd like to focus only on primary sources for evidence to try and set the record straight about what we actually know about the mysterious creator of Bitcoin despite the fact that Satoshi took a wide variety of steps to make sure no paper trail would lead back to him no matter how good you are at operational security the fact of the matter is whenever you connect and interact online with others what you do and say still directly gives clues to what type of person you are any good poker player will tell you that whenever you sit down to play at a table every little thing you do sends information to the other players there whether that information is body language decision-making or even your word choice to the others at the table all of these give hints towards a poker games final outcome in our search for the creator of Bitcoin I'd like to collect a vast majority of the analysis on the internet and compile it together in a similar way to my poker analogy that being said understanding this topic requires quite a bit of background information so bear with me without further ado to start our timeline of context I'd like to take you back to the 1980s to begin our attempts at unraveling the true identity of Satoshi not [Music] [Music] despite what many people have been led to believe the influence for the creation of Bitcoin spans way farther back in history than just 2007 the roots for the creation of Bitcoin actually take place all the way back in the late 1980s and much of their influence can be traced back to one individual by the name of David chow David Chama was a cryptographer and computer scientist who was well known for his various contributions to the cryptographic community in and around 1982 he released a paper called blind signatures for untraceable payments this academic paper ultimately led to the creation of a company by the name of digi cash an anonymous payment system much of David Chang's work is what could be credited as the main influence to the activist group known as this cypherpunks Satoshi had a knowledge of the cyberpunk group what it stood for and he seemed to know many but not all of the popular members but more on that later the term cyberpunk is something that is crucial in understanding the origin of Bitcoin and who its potential creator might be so for the sake of simplicity I'll give you the Wikipedia definition for what a cyberpunk is a cyberpunk is any activist advocating widespread use of strong cryptography and privacy enhancing technologies as a route to social and political change originally communicating through the cypherpunks electronic mailing lists informal groups aim to achieve privacy and security through proactive use of cryptography to explain a bit further here cypherpunks essentially saw ahead in time in regards to the lack of privacy found in our modern Internet nowadays we give up all of our info to advertisers and the government and by now you could argue we've all just accepted that we're all being monitored in the 1970s though that was a bit different and encryption was something that was really only used by governments and spies as these methods of encryption made their way out to the general public cypherpunks advocated against Big Brother by promoting cryptography and other practices on an individual basis cypherpunks sort of wanted the average consumer to take their own online privacy into their own hands by giving them tools to do so as you can imagine teaching advanced cryptographic techniques to the general public and getting them to care about online privacy would be an uphill battle as most people the time didn't even own a home computer [Music] this was the roots of the cypherpunks though and as mentioned previously their main form of communication was a very active email list called the cryptography mailing list you can think of this email list as a sort of precursor to an online forum and this mailing list was so active that trolls of the time would actually sign people up on their behalf to flood their inboxes with spam this mailing list was started around 1982 by Eric Hughes Timothy C May and John Gilmore who founded a small group that met monthly at Gilmore's company Cygnus solutions in the San Francisco Bay Area here as like-minded individuals they would discuss a wide variety of political topics and goals of the group had in mind as a cypherpunk community grew the mailing list grew quickly as well to over a few thousand individuals and over time it became an incredibly active group for discussion over the years as the group grew further the cypherpunks continued to play at least some role in developing a number of notable software's over the years something I want you to keep in the back of your mind as we go forward is that the origin of the site a punk group stems from California consider that at this time in the internet's history you didn't have as far-reaching political activism geographically this group grew far larger by word of mouth more than just random strangers on the internet sharing things like we do today we should keep in mind that the cypherpunks group influence would be strongest where this group had the most people locally if we look at Google Trends for the term cypherpunk leading up to when Satoshi approached the group we can see that California had the highest interest in the United States from 2004 to 2008 Satoshi had come into contact with the cypherpunks influence at some point and something we should consider is that there may be a chance that Satoshi may have been active under a different username prior to creating Bitcoin coding for Bitcoin started in 2007 according to Satoshi so if we look at the cryptography mailing list archive theoretically Satoshi would have been posting previously under another name or another email account as a cyberpunk keep this archive in the back of your mind as I start to add more and more clues to this internet mystery I will link the cryptography mailing list archive in the description for later use what I really want to highlight here more than anything is that California was a hotspot for this groups activism I know this detail might be trivial now but as we start to dig into things you'll understand why I pointed this detail out as mentioned previously the cypherpunks developed a wide variety of software however one thing the cypherpunks couldn't seem to be successful in developing was a digital currency and that's where Satoshi Nakamoto comes in you on October 31st 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto showed what he was working on to the cyberpunk mailing list and sought to turn the proposal into a reality this proposal is the now-famous white paper Bitcoin a peer-to-peer electronic cash system unlike most white papers that came before him Satoshi had already started working on the project prior to writing the white paper in 2007 if you're unfamiliar with the term white paper let me break it down for you as there's a clue here there are quite a few definitions for the term white paper but in this context it's defined as a sort of document with the guiding philosophy towards solving a problem satoshis white paper was a theoretical outline for creating a decentralized currency that others before him failed to do one of the main problems with creating a currency at this time was the double spending problem - which I won't get into technically but in this circumstance Satoshi took knowledge foremothers past work and applied them towards his proposal in creating the Bitcoin project the term white paper itself is actually a British origin and something you should consider is if we look up the Google Trends we can see that out of any of the first world country is up until 2008 when Satoshi posted this the term white paper had almost double the interest in the United Kingdom to top that off and almost every given opportunity in this white paper he would write in British English throughout his various ridings across all his profiles he uses terms like checks analyse favor organize and even bloody difficult throughout all his writings he never spells anything incorrectly though keep in mind that none of us are perfect which means that whatever spell checking software he had at the time was correcting him in a British English [Music] what's incredibly interesting about all of Satoshi's writing on the internet over the years is that he used two full spaces after a period in every single sentence I kid you not go look up his form account on Bitcoin talk and you'll see what I'm talking about this idiosyncrasy is found predominantly in two categories of people one instance for the use of double space after a period is that of academics as a few different college writing styles mandated the use of a double space after a period but here's the thing many of these college formats have since then remove this requirement over the years what's interesting here is that Satoshi casually used this double space after a period method to the point that it became muscle memory which hints at this habit having been done for years this could very well mean that the toshi have learned to type on a typewriter instead of a keyboard as double spacing after a period on a typewriter was required if this is true this gives us a major hint about his age many of the first popular home keyboards for personal computers that actually saw mass adoption weren't even released until 1977 with both the Apple 2 and the trs-80 typically most schools at this time didn't have you write papers on typewriters until college which leads me to believe that satoshi nakamoto is far older than he stated on one of his online profiles on his p2p foundation form accounts it states that he was born on April 5th 1975 which by this time it would make it far rarer that someone would grow up learning to type on a keyboard over a typewriter typewriters saw a pretty steep decline in popularity around 1985 theoretically this would make Satoshi Nakamoto 44 today if he were telling the truth but if we factor in the possibility that Satoshi was around 16 to 18 by the time he began using a typewriter I would estimate that he's around the age of 55 to 64 I know this is speculative so take what I'm saying with the grain of salt here but as far as estimating his age goes this would be my best guess at this time Satoshi claimed that he started working on the project since 2007 and was already well underway and making it a reality many people on the mailing list met this proposal with skepticism the idea for this type of digital money was long in the heads of others before Satoshi but the key difference here was that mr. Nakamoto actually managed to execute on his proposal be money by weight I was another project that was referenced as an inspiration to Bitcoin but never made it past a write up digi cash which barely mentioned earlier was a proposed idea by David charm for anonymous payments where people could take money from a bank and then use the forms of blind cryptographic signatures to store money on their computers and pay for things anonymously digi cash filed for bankruptcy as a company failed to see the adoption in the 1999's due to the fact that ecommerce hadn't really taken off yet another project was bid gold by Nick Szabo and this was basically the precursor to Bitcoin and was incredibly similar but Nick Szabo never turned his big gold into a reality while the two projects at theory were very close Szabo has since written on his blogs the differences and challenges he faced and how Satoshi's idea was an improvement I won't bore you with the technical details but you can go look him up if you're interested many people mentioned that because Nick Zappa wasn't referenced in the white paper and that the project were so similar that Nick Zappa was Satoshi but as it turns out Satoshi did credit nick szabo not just on the white paper but also on his website this seems to suggest that Satoshi Nakamoto hadn't heard about Nick Szabo until his project started to receive attention will discuss the Nick's Abba theory in detail in a bit but for now let's get back to our timeline despite previously failing projects Halfin II decided to be the first to take Satoshi upon his proposal and began to work on the Bitcoin project for free Halfin II was a computer scientist and also a cypher Punk he was pretty well known among the cyberpunk community for his work as a lead developer in the PGP corporation if you've ever dabbled with encryption then you've likely heard of PGP encryption something I should mention is that Satoshi even looked up to hell but more on that later Hal later wrote on the Bitcoin talk forum when Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list he got a skeptical reception at best cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs they tend to have a knee-jerk reaction I was more positive I had long been interested in cryptographic payment schemes plus I was lucky enough to meet and extensively correspond with both Wade I and Nick Szabo generally acknowledged to have created ideas that be realized with Bitcoin as I mentioned previously how worked on the Bitcoin project continuously since his first contact with Satoshi and made a fair amount of money mining the currency in the early days January 3rd 2009 the very first block of Bitcoin was mined and inside this code was a hidden message this message reading The Times January 3rd 2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks which was in reference to the financial collapse of 2008 and was the headline of a United Kingdom newspaper called The Times once again here we see another hint Satoshi being British Satoshi nakamoto's Bitcoin had come with the right place in the right time and that hidden message seems to communicate strongly his intentions for creating the project during the following years up until late 2010 Satoshi would post regularly on the Bitcoin talk forum and make further improvements to the Bitcoin projects he would post daily to the forums and to this day anyone can view his post history on his forum accounts we're going to individually dig up these posts by Satoshi in a bits but for now I should bring up Satoshi's disappearance without any kind of regulation it was primed to be adopted by criminals and other gray area practices we all know what happened with the Silk Road if he watched Bailey's other video but more in regards to 2010 another incident occurred at the time of satoshis disappearance for context and late 2010 WikiLeaks was one of the prime targets for the US government as a result of leaking countless confidential files to the public no government likes a whistleblower and a bounty was made on the organization WikiLeaks was in between a rock and a hard place as the site was hit with frequent DDoS attacks and funding was cut off as no payment processor wanted to work with them any company providing payment services to WikiLeaks became directly associated with them which made them a target by the government as well in 2010 a thread was started on the Bitcoin talk forum that linked to an article from PC world comm keep in mind at this time Bitcoin was still relatively unheard of when the article titled could the WikiLeaks candle lead to the new virtual currency popped up it suggested that Bitcoin could have been a solution to current funding problems over at WikiLeaks this was one of the most popular sites to link to Bitcoin at the time and as a result a flood of new traffic came in over the brewing WikiLeaks scandal it was even reported that right after this article was published the entire Bitcoin forum went down from the influx of new visitors many people chimed in on this thread gawking at the headline and even Satoshi made a post that read the following it would have been nice to get this attention in any other context WikiLeaks has kicked the hornet's nest and the swarm is headed towards us it appears that Satoshi saw an impending threat from the government has not long after this post he'd move away from Bitcoin Satoshi would only make one other update to Bitcoin and would later hand off the project to a man by the name of Gavin Andersson something I should explain is that Bitcoin by nature is an open-source project and by this time there were quite a few people involved Gavin was a computer scientist that graduated from Princeton and at the time he was developing new products for the Bitcoin market as a result of Satoshi's absence for a time he became the spokesman for Bitcoin after handing off the project to Gavin Satoshi was still in contact via email for a short while and so one final day on April 26th 2011 Satoshi would write the following to Gavin I wish you wouldn't keep talking about me as a mysterious shadowy figure the press just turns that into a private currency angle maybe instead make it about the open source project and give credit to your dev contributors it helps motivate them Satoshi really didn't like the angle of Bitcoin being adopted by criminals as opposed to risk of him being targeted by the government keep in mind this email was sent two months after the Silk Roads launch and by now Satoshi had been full aware of what bitcoin was shaping up to being after this email Gavin had informed Satoshi that he was invited to speak at a conference hosted by the CIA but he never actually replied and to this day this is the last known verified correspondence from him [Music] when I initially started working in this video I imagined a one part documentary but with a topic like this I really wanted to take my time and slow things down and improve the video polish the saga that includes this mystery is so extensive that I'd be doing you a disservice by not splitting it into a series to make it easier to follow there are a ton of implications around the mystery of satoshi nakamoto so I want to cover it in a way that explains the scope of the situation and debunk popular misinformation in the next video or videos we will discuss the events after Satoshi's disappearance and narrow down his online profile much further with all that being said I'll see you in the next episode this is barely sociable have a good night [Music] you",30:02
y-jdvMU1EKo,Throttle House,Automobile,Dodge Durango Hellcat vs Lamborghini Urus vs Jeep Trackhawk // DRAG & ROLL RACE,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-jdvMU1EKo,9 months ago,2.6M views,Automobile,you're watching throttle house i'm thomas and i'm james and this is a drag race [Music] look at that let's keep this simple these are the three most powerful gas suvs that you can buy all three are all-wheel drive and all three will put a massive dent in your wallet let's race if you're new to follow us we do car reviews track tests and quite a lot of messing around so subscribe and hit the bell [Music] okay this is the jeep trackhawk a legend all-wheel drive supercharged v8 and one of the most powerful launch control systems in the world because you have to like mash the brake harder than you've ever applied a brake pedal before because it can barely hold itself back it just like strains the leash trying to get forward it's amazing i love it okay we're going here we're going to go into track mode there's a launch we're going to make sure that all the settings are as fast as possible james thinks this is going to be a close race i think that carsten with his legendary incredible focus is going to roast us in the urus but the temperatures are very very cold today and he's been having a hard time when those p0 is getting off the line so we'll see what happens i'm not entirely sure what's going to go on all right i am in the srt hellcat durango by the numbers this is the biggest car here the most heavy the biggest booty and the most power the odds are against me because of my size but that's always been the case throughout my life so i'm i'm still confident somehow this has a ridiculous launch control the torque peak talk is available lower than in the trackhawk and i've been knocking out 3.4 seconds or 60s on the regulars so i'm just hoping i can stay in the game [Music] oh my god oh i'm crushing the trackhawk come on i cannot believe i'm ahead yes yes oh what a monster and the durango takes the win oh my lord followed by the trackhawk followed by the urus oh my god i do believe they've created a monster what that well what what it's durango it's the wrangenstein frankenstein oh my god as soon as we started rolling like ever all three of us were matched matched just matched i think what happened with that launch control on the iris was that those those pirellis are just not gripping in this temperature no maybe not and apparently the uh the oh these are also pirellis but they're scorpions so are those mate we got the same tyre inch that was very it was hilarious like watching all three from my perspective they were all they we might as well have been sparked the cars were parked that was brilliant these have very aggressive launch controls insanely i'm curious to see what happens if we take away the launch control aspect yeah it's been interesting in the past yeah and we just do a dig just by transferring the foot and so no actually like if you just arrived at a traffic light boom you didn't have time to put it into launch yeah what happens when you slam it all right let's give it a go okay so in this dig race we're not going to use launch control which is going to transfer our brake foot to our accelerator foot take away the advantage of these ridiculous launch controls see what happens supercharged versus turbocharged versus supercharged here we go again all right here we go and he's taking it again what is in that durango what's in it is a handful more horsepower wow oh the trackhawk's catching me at the very end now [Music] you know you know what that is what is it they they've they the torque is accessible lower in this oh that's right yeah yeah at 500 or 600 rpm makes all the difference so a pair of cheese-eating americans just walked the lean italian [Laughter] well let's see what happens in the roll okay because it's possible that with gearing i mean the italians are not dumb you know no they know what to do it's a serious car that's the series it's the germans right now it's a two-nil to america yeah yeah what a race i don't know how i feel about that these these are literally matched perfectly you you were slightly catching me wasn't it yeah didn't feel like it i'm curious here yeah i didn't feel like it my ego was like yeah i know i was on you i know i'm doing pizza burps right now i'm so proud yeah i don't even mean pizza all right roll race roll race okay the roll race is the one i'm now sliding it's two nil to the durango but the roll race is the one i'm slightly scared of because yeah i feel like the launch has been really good in this um but we'll see we'll see i don't know if it's possible but all of this has made carsten look more serious than he's ever looked he sees how he wants revenge all right here we go here we go here we go down while the euros is going ahead as is the trackhawk oh i've just got the durango and the urus is just and the durango's had its day oh what a shame oh my god these are fun the suvs should not be this fun i don't know much for you now it's about that's the in my in my defense that's the result you called at the beginning of the day with the dicks yeah i did and i have a feeling that if if it was hot obviously you're just gonna make excuses now i'm just saying that that okay whatever all that matters is that that's kind of the accurate representation of power to wait for all these three i think right i was worried that as well because crostin was looking very vengeful and focused yeah and it's one of those things like i i feel like i'd wake up with him over my bed with a knife you know yeah you ever just watched anybody sleep was fun though these these cars are nuts they're just insane like the fact that i'm sorry we just had to recap recap for everybody at home the fact that these two dodge in a jeep are keeping up with that how much does that thing cost like 350 a 350 000 lamborghini yeah oh that tells you everything i don't know i my chin my chins your chips how many do you have you're white you're bringing back some high school days my cheeks no i know yeah me too it's crazy what a day wow what a day wow america needed a win this year and they got it listen to the sound of the wind oh yes hellcat love these things i love them and that's probably because they're just exceedingly easy to love unapologetically monstrous and irresponsibly fast hellcats they just scratch a very particular itch that most other suvs don't come close to yes the turbocharged urus with its sports car like agility and stunning interior does earn its increased price but there's nothing quite like an 11.5 second quarter mile in a three row 5700 pound supercharger screaming tank and so that dodge could keep the durango hellcat special there's only going to be 2 000 of them ever thanks for watching and stay tuned for our full review of it coming very soon,9:19
Strwla1ELdA,Drew Gooden,Blog,Vine: Where Are They Now?,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Strwla1ELdA,4 years ago,7.8M views,Blog,"heaven stop you getting cream cheese all over the table honey I'm a retired police officer not a maid plus I'm fat and that's what makes my character funny [Laughter] fine you're right Kevin I love you [Applause] good evening everyone we interrupt this up oh come on not right now bring you the important story this is a really big news story that you won't want to miss be sure to state really every channel what is so important twitter has announced that their popular social media app vine will be closing its doors in the next couple months this moment the specific details of this move are unclear but one thing I know for certain is that if you're a minor and your only source of online relevance and health self-worth it's a number of buying followers you have than I imagine this news is simply devastating to my god I heard can you believe this no that's crazy they're shutting down fine what oh no I wasn't listening to that I'm on the news news news boy do I love the new ads I'm the news anchor which is weird because I didn't think I was am i why didn't I know this no you're not this is a sketch drew you're just playing all the characters characters you recorded that yesterday and now you're just playing it on the TV I'm not so sure I'm following alright clearly this is getting too meta did you just write this part in because you didn't know because I didn't know how to end this sketch yeah I figured nine-one-one hi I'd like to order a sandwich also you wrote a sketch that's supposed to take place one year ago just pickles ends the phone you gave yourself was a Motorola RAZR uh-huh do you think that people still used razor phones a year ago remember when people stop using razors can everybody please do me a favor and refrain from commenting on my little band-aid no I'm not gonna tell you how I hurt my finger and I'm definitely not gonna tell you how to use a cheese grater because apparently I don't know and I'm absolutely not gonna tell you why the only band-aids I own are from a movie called The Secret Life of pets which I've never heard of hello everybody and welcome back to the dumpster behind a Chili's today we're gonna be taking a little trip down memory lane specifically my memory as I don't have access to anybody else's and although this video will be filled with personal stories and experiences through my own eyes I think there will be something in this video for everybody particularly if you used to be a Viner or if you were ever just a big fan of vines as many of you may know it's been exactly one year since vine announced that they would be shutting down it's actually been a little bit more than a year depending on how long it takes me to make this video close enough and although it doesn't feel like it's been that long a lot has changed in the past year now every once in a while I will start watching one of the vine compilations that they're all over YouTube and I find myself watching these sometimes and seeing someone and being like what happened to them do you ever watch an old vine and I'm not just talking about like the popular Viners like Lele pons and those sort of people who have not moved on to other things obviously but some of the one-hit wonder vines like this guy you're my emo happened to him and with this being the anniversary of the death of vine I figured this would be a perfect opportunity to do a little bit of research and figure out where some of these prominent figures have disappeared to and because vine was such an enormous ly significant part of my life I wanted to have this one definitive video where I talked about pretty much my entire experience with vine how it changed my life well I think vine was good and why I also think vine was bad because obviously it had its flaws otherwise it would still exist today but for now let's go ahead and take a deep dive into the first ever segment of vine and there's supposed to be uh I got song [Music] cuz some kind in the mail today Deez Nuts ah daddy I laugh every time the Deez Nuts guy whose real name is Charles nuts is one of the most notorious figures to ever come from vine as you all know Charles went on to host his very own prank show on vh1 the Deez Nuts prank hour which ran for 12 seasons and is still the highest rated show in television history who can forget that season 6 crossover episode with Ashton Kutcher where they both thought they were pranking each other your despite strong ratings throughout its entire 600 episode run the Deez Nuts prank hour was cancelled back in August when they simply ran out of people to prank and he can't prank someone twice Zack stop Zack stop you're gonna get in trouble yeah this vine was called kicked too much and without a doubt it's one of my favorite vines ever but it does leave you with a lot of questions like why was he kicking so much why did his friends keep telling him not to well I guess it makes sense why they told him not to because he ended up getting arrested but it's a it's a pretty confusing vine and I continued to be confused about this for months until very recently I was just fed up of that and I decided to do a quick google search and I found out very quickly that he was simply arrested for reaching the legal kick limit in one day afterwards I became very angry at all the people who didn't do as much research as I did and continue to question this fine the answers were right in front of you you just had to google it and although it seems a little harsh that he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole the law is the law and you have to respect the law Iridessa cleitus unfortunately this kid did go on to lose this spelling bee after a late field goal in overtime but as all stories must have a happy ending he is currently the mayor of Sacramento this story does not have a happy ending after facing the worst public humiliation of his life this poor guy had to move to a different state where he was unable to get an apartment or even a job because he forgot his wallet Who am I let's go to the [ __ ] [ __ ] Ming came in judge corbin blue one of the most mysterious figures on vine after an anonymous Reddit user made a strong case that this corbin bleu is not the same corbin bleu from the High School Musical franchise people began to question the true identity of corbin however there is a rumor going around that I think sounds pretty convincing I apologize in advance for condoning a rumor that doesn't have a hundred percent tarred evidence to back it up but I feel very strongly about this one basically the rumor is that corbin bleu is spider-man they may be thinking that's ridiculous spider-man lives in New York while corbin bleu lives on the internet but there's a pretty convincing argument to be made that these two are in fact the same person for one let's take a look at Corbin's post schedule now I'm gonna go ahead and scroll down to 2015 because there's a pretty noticeable discrepancy in here there we go Corbin posted three times on October 16 2015 but then he didn't post again until the 28th of October nearly two weeks later now ask yourself where was Corbin now it stands to reason that if spider-man had a vine account he wouldn't be able to post every day because he'd be busy fighting the Green Goblin and whatever other villains he has and this wasn't just a one-time thing the behavior continues November 17th he posts and then not again until December 11th that's nearly a month Spiderman presumably fights a lot of crime and would be very busy and I imagine this is exactly the kind of post schedule he would be forced to maintain when you look at all this evidence combined it seems obvious that there's no other answer possible Corbin Bleu is spider-man there are a lot of people assume that this was Cole Hirsch playing a character just because they have the same snapchat account and they look very similar but if you ask me that isn't really enough evidence to say oh they're the same person like I said earlier this video is all about the truth everything in this video is true I did a lot of research to find out all these things about all these people and I think it would ruin my credibility as a video maker if I condone such ridiculous rumors without any real hard evidence plus it just seems very obvious that Corbin is spider-man ah we'll get back to that segment in a moment but first I want to talk a little bit about why I think vine was good and also why vine was bad because I think both are true the most important thing I want to make clear in this video is I am a million percent thankful to vine for what they allowed me to do and where they allowed me to go I want to talk honestly about what I think some of the problems with vine were um and I don't think it's like like I said I don't think it's that crazy to say that vine had its flaws because it doesn't exist anymore but ultimately I want to make it clear that I love vine I appreciate the hell out of vine and all the employees and the people I met and everyone that allowed me to be where I am today vine was a perfect place to start out on the internet to build a platform from scratch if you wanted to be an online content creator vine was the place to start it was easy to make vines it was easy for your vines to be seen vine was all about ideas because with vine the distance between an idea and the execution of that idea was very short you could have the idea for a vine and within a couple hours it exists roadwork ahead yeah I sure hope it does and then a few hours past that it's got a million loops and a bunch of Commons and likes and all this validation is given to you for the idea you had a couple hours ago so vine was great in that way but really what made vine great was the people on vine it was such a fun group of creators to be a part of because everyone was supportive of each other it'd be so fun to see your friend or just someone you fall and really like you see a vine they post you're like oh that's a great idea that's so funny that's fantastic they posted a couple minutes ago and you know that's gonna go viral and then you check back a few hours later it's got the little flame emoji next to the view count it's number one on the comedy page with things like vine and YouTube they can only exist with the people using them and they're only as good as the content creators on the app and vine for the most part had a fantastic group of creators and I don't think it was the quality of vines that led to its demise everything that led to its demise was more numbers they weren't making money that sort of thing but I think there was some really great content and really great people on vine now shifting the focus a little bit to what were some of vines flaws and I think a lot of the things that made vine good were unfortunately also the things that made vine doomed to fail in the same way that vine was accessible to creators it was also pretty limiting because it was six seconds long I can't tell you how many times I would sit there trying to edit a vine shorter and shorter and shorter and I could get it to like eight seconds nine seconds and it's just like I can't I can't make this any shorter I can't post this it was hard to fit a good joke into six seconds and sometimes so many vines were perfect at that length but as a creator you start using vine and as your ideas start to get more elaborate you need to go to other platforms to express those ideas even while vine was still around through a lot of 2016 I wasn't really using vine as much because I was trying to figure out you know I was at a point where it's like okay I've done buying for a little bit and I feel good about this I feel good about what I've done but what's next you know and I think a lot of people had that same thing vine was this great place to be but there was always that idea of like well I'm not gonna be here forever so what's next and that brings me to what I think is pretty much my main point on why I think vine was always doomed to fail the way I think of it is everybody has their own career ladder in their head where the top of the ladder represents total creative fulfillment if you were as successful as you could possibly imagine what does that look like and the top of the ladder is different for everybody maybe the ultimate fulfillment for you is you want to write a movie or you want to act in a TV show you want to be like Dwight from the office maybe that's your ultimate career goal or maybe you want to be just famous enough to get fourth place on Dancing with the Stars it's different for everybody so while every vine creators ladder was slightly different I think what they all had in common was that vine was not at the top in fact I think vine for most people was the bottom step it was the first step and there's nothing wrong with that I don't mean to disparage vine in any way but I think for most people no one had success on vine and was like I'm gonna do this forever because it just didn't seem to work out that way it didn't seem viable he was great for starting out but once you get to a point where it's like okay where do I go with this it was usually the next place to go is somewhere else so going back to the latter analogy if vine is the first step that means two things one it was accessible enough to be reached from the ground but the ultimate job of the first step of the ladder is to propel you to the next step of the ladder and so that's what vine was it was 100% necessary first step that would propel people further along I imagine this type of thing made it very difficult to be an employee at vine or someone who had a large role at vine because they would probably see these very talented people come in and use vine to go do something else like they came and they got what they came for but ultimately they just needed to leave and do something else from the rest of my career no matter what I do whether I completely fizzle out and never do anything or whether I go on to be a millionaire movie maker I will owe my start to vine it doesn't matter how talented or funny I think I am I am recognized now as an online entertainer because of vine failing to express gratitude for the thing that got you where you are now shows a complete and utter lack of self-awareness going back to the latter analogy it's pretty easy when you're on that second step to look down at the ground and see how far you've come but let's not forget that when you were on the ground you couldn't reach that second step without the first one halo again so these guys were both pretty popular and vine I haven't seen much of them in a while though so I'll have to look into that on all levels except physical I am off shout-out to the Twitter follower who sent me this paparazzi photo that was taken a couple weeks ago with this guy one of the first things you'll notice is that this is a picture of a wolf and that he is a wolf now on all levels including physical take another life coach just give me a sec give me a sec give me a sec bootie this family is such a perfect encapsulation of what made vine so special every once in a while you'd find someone and just just marvel at the fact that they exist that there's someone out there like that because the young girl Jay Rose is so interesting on her own the way she sings there's too much drama at school all you gotta do is walk away yeah yeah and even just the way she's branded herself gyro but on top of that you add in her uncle your uncle your uncle you add in her grandma or her aunt I'm not actually sure you've got that right honey and it's all about the cook also you look at a bind like this yeah take a look on the babes for days which makes sense you know it has a set up in a punch line but then you realize that the babes for days that they're talking about two of them are like 10 years old we're just gonna gloss over that I got your drink up this makes me miss vine because this reminds me of like all the weird people you discover and it just they leave you with so many questions who are these people what is this family and why don't they have their own reality show well I actually found out that they do uncle's home well premiere its first season next month it's a YouTube read exclusive email man what he got just as I don't love in my opinion Danny was one of the best Finers he was very popular because he was able to make vines that were relatable enough for everybody to understand but there is so much better than all of the other relatable vines and Viners that existed because he's a legitimately hilarious person if you liked him on vine he's still making youtube videos now and if you're not already subscribed you should go check him out the only thing with Danny and he might get mad that I even brought this up but I feel like I should say something about this because if you click on any of his videos all the comments are about this but a few months ago Danny was diagnosed with permanently upside-down disease for those of you who don't know it's basically a disease where an otherwise healthy persons physical body is upside down permanently you know Danny's a really funny guy but it admittedly can be kind of tough to watch his videos because it's so disorienting to see someone who's just upside down the whole time like I said all his comments are about that people seem to be frustrated and confused but props to Danny for not just editing the video so it looks like he's right-side up because if he were to do that then he would no longer be raising awareness for a very real condition that affects millions of person and that's something you simply can't put a price on if you ask me though I think he needs to [ __ ] fix that [ __ ] in Premiere it's gross and I don't like it without a doubt the best memory I have from vine and one of the best memories I have from my whole life so far is getting to work on camp unplug camp unplug more like camp run plugs like camp I plug my jacket for those of you who don't know what camp unplug is that's probably most of you let me explain it so in March of 2016 I got a message on Twitter from this guy Jeremy who works at vine and at first like I couldn't believe it was real he asked if I wanted to be a part of this series that they had written and we're gonna film over the summer and they were gonna fly us out to this camp in Wisconsin and then they were gonna take us to VidCon as like featured creators they were gonna do all these things and pay for all this stuff for us almost everybody on the list I had heard of and was a fan of they're fine so not only was I gonna be a part of this awesome thing but I'd get to meet all these people up until this point I hadn't met set for maybe a couple other Viners who happen to live in Orlando I hadn't really met any creators from vine and so it was so exciting to meet these people who had watched for all this time and actually meet them in real life it also made me a little nervous because I didn't know if I'm I think I'm funny or in real life than I was on vine but there's there was also part of me was like oh I hope they like me which is pretty much just my constant mental state before I do anything what was so cool about it was that they gave us a script Chris Mel burger shooting and Jeremy wrote a great script but everything within the whole project was also 100% collaborative so the first night we got there were sitting down at the table reading the old script and whirled in our lines and any time someone had an idea like oh maybe my character should say this instead it was like there wasn't there was never any sense of like ah maybe you should just do what's in the script you know it was like everyone had their own ideas and everyone's ideas were listened to another thing that specifically for me that was so cool that I got to be invited to this was like at the time when they first asked me I think I only had like a hundred thousand followers which is it's good but there were probably thousands of people who had more followers than me certainly just among the group of people there most of the people there had over a million they were some of the biggest Viners I know Cody had about 2 million Danny had over 1 million maybe he had 2 million at the time Lauren Geraldo had like three million Victor Pope all these people all these people had had so many more followers than I did if it wasn't for this I don't think I would have ever had any vines with any of these people just because I don't live in LA and I didn't then and I still don't and nobody lives in Florida except for like Tiger Woods but I don't know if that would be a good PR move if I had started collaborating with Tiger Woods in conjunction with the release of camp unplug was also vines release of this feature where you could attach longer videos to your vines and that was really the only way this story could be told on the vine platform and couldn't just be a bunch of little six-second scenes so the way camp unplugged was told was you have these like two to five minute long scenes then as these fictional campers have some downtime they get into their own little antics you go you and I go you should jump Oh piss off off this fine I will it was so cool to [ __ ] it was so cool to be a part of that you're probably waiting for me to like get to the point here right now it's just me gushing about these memories I have and the people I got to meet but that's really that's all it is I just I look back and I gosh it the fact that I got to do this like I alluded to they also invited us to VidCon now if you've never been to VidCon and I'd like to go back but this was my one and only time going to VidCon so far it comes crazy VidCon is it's it's a whole different world because you've got this entire subsection of humanity all come packed into one place I don't know if I'll ever feel like as much of a celebrity as I did that weekend the fact that I was technically a featured creator they had their whole booth set up it was one of the the ones near the front they had these big LED screens and my big dumb face would cycle through every once in a while so that was crazy but they also took us to Disneyland which was awesome they rented out this whole section of Denny's nearby so every night between like 9 p.m. and 3 a.m. or something you know you'd have all these drunk creators going there all the food was free we lit you could order whatever you wanted off the menu and it was so free to the point where you would see like people would come in drunk and order something and then not wait for it and you just see like a big stack of nachos just untouched we vine celebrities really abused the hell out of that whole experience but definitely yeah definitely the best one of the best experiences of my life and something that I felt like I had to talk about you know if I'm gonna make this whole video [ __ ] I am so glad I get to take this off now it is so hot it's like 80 degrees in my apartment because I have to turn the a/c off while I film because it's very loud and Jesus Christ uh this I feel good this feels good man hello yeah can I just get like a raw potato and a spoon and then just an egg get to drink thank you sweetheart oh hey we're back to Bros chillin in the hut 5 feet apart cuz they're not gay this was a pretty big headline at the time so you sure you guys already heard about this but basically as the night went on the two bros so as to not be confused for being in a homosexual relationship slowly drifted further and further apart from each other until they both ended up in the middle of the ocean where they were tragically eaten by two different dolphins I was later revealed that those dolphins were in fact married and that is ironically a pretty gay way to die legend has it that this boy is still running no one knows where he is or how far he's run or if he'll ever come back his friends have moved on and so is his family they've replaced his room with a room that's just filled with water all the time no one goes in and no one comes out Tyrone you notice your baby Cole a brand the whitest and boys east of dim white boys if not from vine you may know Cole from his YouTube channel where he and his wife like to film her three-year-old daughter getting hurt you may also know him from that time he tweeted about losing his virginity on his wedding night and then blocked me when I made a really good joke about it Cole I wasn't making fun of you for waiting to lose your virginity I think that's awesome if that's your belief that you want to wait till you're married to have sex and you'd actually do that's great man that's awesome that's I'm proud of you for that I was making fun of the fact that presumably moments after you've finished having sex for the very first time you pulled out your phone and said just had sex no I'm not gonna talk about it I could talk about this for hours you guys would not believe the restraint it took to not make a video about this a couple months ago a lot to say but I didn't want to stir the pot any more than I already did because Cole he's a nice guy he he's a nice guy he's just really really bad at the internet no no problem but you did go straight Road Victor Pope jr. is sincerely one of the funniest people I've ever met he is such a natural comedian and he was so good at vine right now he's in LA doing stand-up he's also done a couple things with super deluxe that are just such high-quality I'm gonna link those in the description because I think they're so funny and well made and I think you should check them out but that being said a lot of people are asking about this ghost we all want to know did he ever get his Subaru unfortunately he was riding his bike on his way to the subaru dealer to potentially get his new car but on the way he was captured by the ragtag group of paranormal experts on the show Ghost Adventures the good news is he was the first real ghost that was ever captured by one of those entirely fake reality ghost television shows the bad news is of course he is trapped in eternal captivity um but it's probably for the best because his credit score really is just terrible Adam hi welcome to chili Adam and Patrick Perkins who you might know as patchy were twins who blew up on vine in the summer of 2015 and they seemed poised to become the next big vine stars that is until a couple months went by and they sort of just stopped posting perhaps they started to feel the pressure of having a lot of people paying attention to them or maybe they just wanted to have normal lives they were about to start college and maybe they just wanted to focus on that which is fine not everybody has to be famous they still have an online presence mostly on Instagram a little bit on Twitter but despite limited information I was able to dig up that the Perkins twins are now the Perkins triplet that's right through the passage of time in the miracle of life a new Perkins boy has spawned and dare I say he might even be the cutest and now we take a moment to reflect on some of the people would you not eat my pants [Music] oh they're not dead I just don't know what happened to them kids I'm gonna tell you an incredible story the story of How I Met Your Mother okay dad I started buying pretty late in the game I didn't start until about February 2015 and so to set the scene a little bit at the time I had just dropped out of college for like the third time and I was we're gonna pop eyes I knew I wanted to be a comedian for a living like that's I knew I wanted to pursue that but I didn't know how I was doing improv at the time but I wasn't that good at improv but I saw what some other people were doing on vine and how vine itself had sort of evolved in the year and a half or so that it had been around and that piqued my interest and so I looked at that and I was like you know what if they can do it I can do it I'm gonna be good at vine and then so I started vine and I wasn't good at vine I was pretty bad at it when it started and I think I deleted like 90% of the things I posted but I guess mathematically that does mean that every tenth thing I posted was not that bad so you know after a couple months I eventually got a little bit better I accumulated some good vine so after slowly crawling my way up from 50 followers to like 250 followers finally in April a couple of my vines got pretty big I got a Joe Jonas revine that's just sort of a tale as old as time you know how many comedians don't have Joe Jonas to thank for their initial stars so then after that I went from like 300 followers to 30,000 or so followers in like a couple weeks which is a type of success I had never experienced on the internet before it was amazing and then I got reached out to from someone at tosh point-o asking if they could use my vine on the show and I was like of course okay I feel good to be so in such a short amount of time I went from an absolute nobody who worked at Popeyes to a person who had a very small amount of internet success who still worked at Popeyes so not much of a change I guess but it was you know there's a lot of cool things all at once however the coolest thing that happened and I'm only explaining all this to sort of give a little bit of a backstory the most important thing that happened to me during this period of other important things haven't right before a girl commented on one of my vines specifically this fine that moan you have to phone so you don't know which one is ringing using the island record and she said oMG you are so cute and your vines are like pure liquid gold now a normal person in this situation would probably just ignore this comment or the very least smile and move on with their lives but me a not normal person decided to do the opposite and pursue it heavily you have to understand at the time I was very lonely and like a good detective I was not about to turn down such a promising lead I found her Instagram page from her vine bio and I looked at a couple pictures was like holy [ __ ] and she's perfect and then so I messaged her I got a phone number we started texting and gone along really well you know everything was great except oh [ __ ] she lives in Arizona and I lived in Orlando so that was kind of a bummer but we got along really well we kind of liked each other right away and so it was like you know didn't no pressure we don't have to commit to anything let's just keep talking and so we talked every day like I said we texted every day for like a week and then after a week she wanted to FaceTime and I was very nervous to FaceTime because I nervous to do anything but I agreed and I called her so we facetimed for six hours seven hours maybe the whole night so not only do we talk from the moment I got home from work until the moment I had to go to bed so I could wake up for work the next day but during the seven hour FaceTime she bought a plane ticket to come see me so I think less than a week into talking to someone who I've never met we agreed to come see each other and not murder each other I remember like the couple months before like we bought the ticket and then but we didn't plan to see each other till like June so it was a couple months and her family kept making fun of her and her friends like oh you're definitely gonna get catfished the thing that I mean we felt pretty good because we did FaceTime and we could see that we were real people like I still could have murdered her if I wanted to I didn't I didn't want to because things went pretty well and luckily she didn't murder me either I think the best thing I had going for me at the time even though I worked full-time at a fast food restaurant was that I lived in Orlando which is kind of a funny thing to say because generally nothing good comes from being a Floridian but I will say Orlando is a very good place to live if you want to host someone from out of town for a few days because you've got Disney you've got Universal which is way better than Disney you've got SeaWorld which just kidding don't go to SeaWorld and then you've got the beach in like every direction so we did all of that except for SeaWorld obviously because [ __ ] SeaWorld but I remember being a little awkward at first it was definitely the first time either of us had done something like this where we talked to someone for like a few months before meeting them you know um and like you can text someone all day every day and talk on the phone every once in awhile but it's still gonna be a little bit different when you finally meet in person I think we'd both kind of set up expectations and it was a little bit weird like the first day but then the next four days or three days or whatever we're like the best days ever and every day was better than the one before and we just liked each other so much by the end of it that it was like alright well we can't not do this you know it's gonna be tough to do long-distance but we can't just uh it was something that wouldn't have worked if we didn't like each other as much as we did because long-distance relationships do suck and there were plenty of difficult times as you can see in these pictures I was not always happy it worked out because we were both like 21 or 22 and we both still had to like kind of get our own life's lives in order a long-distance relationship can be good and in that way you know because it's like you have a couple months at least for us we had a couple months to focus on ourselves and I got a better job eventually and I was getting better at vine because I could focus on that and then every like two or three months you have a four day vacation together so it actually worked out alright you know and we did that for like a year and a half and I have a lot of great memories from that everything was great the accident just kidding this story has a happy ending no I think the the most romantic ending possible for the story would be how I I just couldn't take it anymore I couldn't do long-distance I had to be with the woman of my dreams so I drove across the country and I just showed up at her doorstep one day and I popped out a ring and I said will you marry me and she was crying and she said yes I will do that and then we would be married and then immediately I get her pregnant and we would raise the kid into like the next Superman or something and then he would be I don't know what I'm and then we would drive my 2012 Honda Civic into the sunset and we would live happily ever after that's sort of what happened but it was more like hey we don't want to do long-distance anymore but we still like each other so let's move to the same place and if if you're gonna move to me then I got to give you this ring so I can show you that I'm committed to and so that's what we did she picked out the ring I paid for it quick sidenote fellas if you can get you a girl to pick out your ring for you do it it's a huge relief it's a huge decision you now don't have to make you only have to spend like you know two-thirds of your life savings on it but she moved to Orlando she got the first two jobs she applied for and she's still working both of those and she loves it here I hope I love it here I love to be with her you know I get to live with my best friend I got to sleep in the same bed as her every night which actually we both agree isn't that good we kind of wish we're kind of thinking of getting bunk beds you know so we can have our own space but it's like it's just like every time I think about it and we talked about this we'd love to tell this story I met my wife my future wife because a girl commented on a video I made the stupidest video ever that I made she was like oh you're cute and I'm like me the horny desperate 21 year old was like you're cute too let's kiss let's let's talk and stuff and then we did and then our in the same house and we're married in principle wife's freaking crazy and vine is the best really my main reason for telling the story is to show all of the people out there to watch my videos and I'm so appreciative of you guys but I know there's some of you a lot of you who watched my videos and you don't give a [ __ ] about fine you didn't follow me on vine my YouTube account is so different than what I made on vine it's like I understand that people watch my videos and they don't always like my vines now I hope by telling you by showing you the things I got to do because the vine the the fact that it is the reason I met my wife I hope you guys understand now why vine is so important to me why vine is the was the most amazing experience for me and why I will always cherish this beloved app some takeaways from the story do I think the first time a cute girl comments something nice on a thing you make that you should get married to her every time maybe a small percentage of the time you should do that but it works for me I hope that this story showed you guys that there is hope out there if you just shoot your shot you know if you think someone is acute on the internet town they're cute maybe you'll be dating them in the next two months or maybe if you tell someone they're cute too much then they'll put out a restraining order for you and then that's cool too you know because it's like like what better way to show that you notice someone than by getting a lawyer involved so I think it's a win-win always shoot your shot always respect vine because I love it and always always don't do long distance always never do long distance cuz long distance is trash I've already talked to you for about eight hours now about vine so I think it's time we start wrapping this up oh that's it I guess videos over right at this point I've spent so long making this video that I don't even know if it's good anymore we'll see as you can tell it's taking quite the physical toll on me my hair is a lot longer I've grown out a full beard or at least my version of that the last thing I want to address and I'll try to make this quick is the recent news that I guess one of the founders of vine is working on his own quote follow-up app to vine he wasn't super specific on any details other than just to like keep an eye out a lot of people were pretty excited about this a lot of people were a little bit more skeptical about this for me I don't know I I mean I just made a 12 hour video about how I loved vine but honestly I don't know if I want it to come back at least not in whatever form this entails a follow up app sounds like something that's similar to fine but isn't vine so let's say that's what it is it's a similar app divine but it's not called vine it's called like loops loops with with a Z of course and to make it stand out we're gonna add in more features that weren't originally on vine for example now you're not limited to 6 seconds you can do a full 15-second video and it still loops again loops with a Z also you'll be able to make a daily story because every social media app seems to have to have stories in it in addition you can also post pictures so if you just want to give like a little quick update to your fans on oh [ __ ] I think we just made Instagram okay so vine comes back and it's just called vine or god forbid vine to vine to comes out and it's exactly the same as vine was well part of the reason vine failed initially was that they were always losing money and so you're gonna need to add some sort of monetization system in place otherwise vine too is going to end up with the same fate as vine one so now you have an app that's the same as vine was except with let's assume ads in between vines are like in the corner of the screen or whatever so it's a lesser product because it's now been diluted by ads it also no longer has the novelty value that vine had when it first came out because that was like five years ago at this point and on top of this it doesn't offer anything that isn't already available on another platform not to be cynical but I am being cynical I don't think it would work out I think people would be really excited about it for a month and then they're gonna stop using it like they did before the creators are gonna slowly leave because there's more profitable uses of their time elsewhere and as they leave the content on the app will dwindle and so will the users who use it and it will have the same exact end as the original vine did except I don't picture it lasting three years this time I picture it lasting like three months call me cynical but that's just how I see it we all have wonderful vine memories but sometimes it's okay for something to just be a memory good things can still come to an end I have great memories from childhood that doesn't mean I want to be 8 again I love being an adult I can do whatever I want I look back on vine with all the love in the world but that doesn't mean it has to exist again for me to cherish it you can cherish memories let it rest move on it's in the past even if it comes back it'll never be the same as it was and that's alright maybe I'm wrong and I would love to be proven wrong something I have had to come to terms with selfishly is that I think I think I'm glad that vine ended just because I know the type of person I am I embrace complacency like nobody's business when things are going well for me I don't always have the same motivation to work as hard as I should because I'm content and that's something I'm trying to improve about myself that's something I've gotten a little better at over time but I know that a year ago vine dyeing was the catalyst for me to figure out what I was going to do now if I never went away I don't know if I ever would have started YouTube I always wanted to but I never felt like I needed to because I was a famous Viner I had 400,000 followers on vine I didn't want to start from scratch on YouTube and have to do like a hundred times more work and learn how to use a real editing program that wasn't just iMovie on my phone my thought process at the time was why would I do all of that extra work when I already had vine and then one day vine died and everything I had spent two years building up was pulled out from under me I was upset I was angry I regretted the fact that I hadn't tried to spread my followers around to other places on the internet I like hundreds of other Viners put all of my eggs in the vine basket and then the basket broke it exploded destroying all of my eggs in the process and now I'm infertile but when vine went away my safety net went away with it and so I had to deal with being irrelevant again for several months and I had to try new things I had to try different types of content and a lot of it didn't work some of it did eventually I figured out what people liked and what I liked doing I worked hard I got super lucky emphasis on that and now I'm about to quit my job to do YouTube full-time and that's something that even at the height of my vine success I never even fathomed the possibility of quitting my full-time job to just do vine full-time that was never a possibility for me and so if I'm being a hundred percent honest which like I said this video is all about the truth for selfish reasons I think I'm glad that vine died feels good to get that off my chest I loved vine and now I love you too I'm ecstatic to be able to do what I'm doing now and I'm so excited to get to continue to do it and see where my channel goes and where it takes me and if I ever get to be on the h3 podcast because that's all I really want the good news is I've learned from my mistakes vine taught me to never put all of my eggs in one basket because you never know what's going to happen and that's a mistake I don't think I'm going to make again except obviously with YouTube because I don't think YouTube's going anywhere YouTube's infallible they've gotten along good PR lately and I just feel comfortable alright guys that's it I want to thank all my beautiful little stinkers out there for watching this entire video if you didn't watch the whole video then it doesn't really matter because you didn't see this part anyway now that I'm finally done with this massive project I have a lot of ideas that have that I haven't at any time to focus on so lots and lots of more content coming lots of new content is what I meant to say and I could have just said I hadn't already said the thing that I was going to mess up I also have an exciting merchant on sment coming pretty soon and I don't think that I'm being too hyperbolic when I say this is going to be the greatest merch of all time seriously guys I'm changing the game so I hope you're ready for that all right well I don't really know what else to say now I think it would be funny if after the world's longest video I end it by just cutting myself off in the middle of a sentence [Music] ten tents",48:09

OoH8G4ZJqOE,LevelCapGaming,VideoGames,Battlefield 4 Best Guns For All Classes,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoH8G4ZJqOE,7 years ago,2.6M views,VideoGames,hey guys level-cap here today I'm going to be talking about the best guns in each category for battlefield 4 so this goes through assault rifles carbines shotguns DMR sniper rifles light machineguns PDW even pistols and for each category I will briefly explain why I think that gun is the best in its own category now the first gun I'm starting with is in the carbine category this is the ak5c not really a huge surprise here it's one of the most popular guns in the entire game because it can be used for any class it's incredibly versatile it's got a nice 700 round per minute rate of fire with a stupidly fast reload of 1.85 seconds the thing that makes this gun so good is that it's incredibly accurate it has very little recoil you can put a few attachments on there to even make that recoil better personally I like to put a flash hider on here and a stubby grip to try and improve the accuracy at range you can really put whatever attachments you want on this gun to fit better fit your play style because it really is just one of the most versatile guns in the entire game this is without question my go-to engineer set up for all conquest games I'll run a rocket launcher and the ak5c and it's just a really great well-balanced kit if you want to play some aggressive recon again the ak5c is a great little carbine to run with now if the ak5c isn't particularly your thing the acw-r brings a bit more power for close-quarter combat it's a very good carbine the ace 21 is also a very good carbine giving you a much bigger magazine of 35 rounds plus one in the chamber now let's move over to the engineer specific weapons these are the PDW so you have some very interesting options here all of these guns are geared very much for close quarters they have high rates of fire not great damage at long range and usually very good hipfire without question my favorite gun for this category is the cz 3 a1 this gun shoots a thousand rounds per minute does 25 damage maximum is a 30 round magazine it is unstoppable in close quarters now the way I like to outfit it and I've actually talked about this in a video I put the laser sight on there to get better hipfire but you can actually control this gun and aim down sights quite well if you put a compensator on there and an angled for grip to deal with the just crazy high four shot recoil this way if you aim down sights you can actually have a gun that's going to out damage most assault rifles even at medium range now unfortunately pdws are not Universal weapons like they used to be in battlefield 3 and so you're only going to use it when you're playing the engineer class and you want to do a lot of close quarter infantry killing but for that it is just absolutely amazing it's got a 1.9 second reload it's really a lot of fun and if you haven't tried it yet you must next up we have bolt-action sniper rifles and my favorite is the SRR 61 now the gold Magnum came out recently and I would say that's probably my second favorite sniper rifle it's very good but the SRR 61 offers something that not a lot of sniper rifles offer and that is the absolute minimum bullet drop maintaining a very high minimum damage of 59 there is a gun out there that has lesser bullet drop than this one the F YJ s the only problem is that it extreme ranges it only does thirty six point six damage so you can't one-shot headshots so the s RR 61 is the least bullet drop for a one-shot headshot at any range and it's absolutely phenomenal just aim for the head any range pretty much and you'll get your headshot extreme distance shooting you might have to aim a little bit above their heads but for the most part it's going to be one of the easiest long-range sniper rifles to use and get kills consistently with now the big downside to this one is the rate of fire you only get 40 rounds per minute which is very slow for a bolt-action sniper rifle and when you compare to a gun like the GOL magnum which is easily my second favorite sniper rifle again this one shoots 60 rounds per minute and it has a 580 meters per second bullet velocity which is only marginally slower than the SRR 61 so gold Magnum still very good at long range but it has a significantly faster rate of fire and that is something that can be a little bit tricky with the SRR 61 you really just have to not miss your shots now how about some guns that are a bit more forgiving with their curacy LMGs they have lots of bullets they fire really fast they're only for the support class and in my opinion the AWS is not only the best support gun out there it's one of the best guns in the game it has a 780 round per minute rate of fire which makes it very lethal in close quarters but what really makes this gun stand out is it's very very low recoil that allows you to be incredibly precise at medium and even longer ranges I feel like I can take out targets no problem and pretty much any sort of distance up against assault rifles up against people with dmrs this thing just feels spot-on accurate and I never really feel outclassed in any gunfight close quarters medium range long range the AWS does it all and it does it really well it's for attachments on this weapon I like to put a stubby grip and flash hider occasionally if I'm feeling like being sneaky I will put a suppressor on here and you have just got one lethal stealth gun now let's switch gears and talk about designated marksman rifles unfortunately dmrs have just had a huge downfall since battlefield 3 they used to be very good in bf3 I would not call them overpowered but definitely very usable now I would say they are pretty much useless and unfortunately one of the best guns in this class is still a difficult weapon to use the SKS offers the highest rate of fire out of any of the dmrs at 333 rounds per minute and it still has a 3 shot kill at any range just like any of the other DMR's out there its accuracy is pretty much on par with most of them maybe a little bit less accurate you can compensate for that with a heavy barrel if you really want to or you can do what I do which is put a muzzle brake and an angle for grip on there to really reduce the recoil on this thing and allow you to just spam fire because unfortunately that's what you need to do with this gun to get any kills three shots to take somebody down you got to fire this thing as fast as possible because you're going up against full auto assault rifles now you'll notice I even relied on the 93r a bit here to try and take out some opponents the 93r in my opinion is one of the best pistols out there it's incredibly reliable burst fire allows you to use it a bit like a traditional pistol but three round burst allows you to drop opponents in close-quarters very quickly and moving on to the shotgun category surprisingly what I think is one of the best shotguns in the game is also one of my least used weapons in the game that is a QB s 0 9 this thing just has an incredible combination of pellets per shot and rate of fire giving it maximum kill ability for minimal amounts of opponents and I say that because you only get six shots now you can still reload those shots at a very quick rate of 0.6 seconds per shot but still if you get a big flank behind some players say there's three or four guys you're not going to have a lot of ammo to deal with all of them so you may even have to switch to your sidearm when getting massive flanks on players or just hope you can reload fast enough you can certainly play around with attachments on this gun use whatever you like it's going to be good no matter what but what I like to use is the full choke so I can kind of bring that spread down make it more accurate it shoots 11 pellets per shot so if you can densify that into one area you can increase the range at which this can one-shot somebody and then if you want the ergo grip will allow you to get better accuracy well on the move which is very important for shotgun users now for the most part I'm really not a big fan of shotgun use in battlefield 4 simply because it really does illustrate how bad the netcode in this game is but if you're going to have a shotgun you may as well use something like the QBs m9 because it's going to give you a lot of follow-up shots it's going to make you rage a little less hard than a pump-action would and last but certainly not least we're on to assault rifles and I don't think anybody's going to be too surprised when I say the ace23 is in my opinion the best assault rifle out there now the ace23 doesn't do anything the best but it's very good in every category when it comes to reload speed accuracy and rate of fire it's a really really well-rounded assault rifle it's going to allow you to do good at pretty much any range now if you want to mix it up and do really well for close-quarters then the aek-971 is absolutely going to decimate your opponent's if you want to get a little bit longer range the m416 is not a bad option by any means so there's certainly a lot of options in the assault class but if you can't decide the ace23 is never going to be a bad choice as for the way to run this then I personally like the stubby grip and the muzzle break combining them allows me to control the gun a bit better and still maintain decent accuracy there's plenty of ways to run this weapon I've seen people use it with the ergo grip and the angled four grip it really all just kind of caters to your playstyle and how good you are at controlling recoil and as for optics obviously you've seen me run a lot of Cobra sights on the guns here Cobra really is my favorite sight as you can see that red dot is very easy to see in all situations no matter how much stuff is blowing up or how much screen shake is going on I always seem to be able to maintain the position of my Cobra optic so now that you've heard my list of what the best guns for each category are it doesn't necessarily mean go and play with each one of them I would recommend trying them out but if you really do like certain play styles that aren't necessarily facilitated by the guns I've recommended then by all means play with something else there's a lot of really good alternative options out there so I hope you guys enjoyed this video and if anything I would hope that you keep yourselves open to trying a lot of different guns out there and not just focusing in on one specific type of weapon all the time it'll make you a better player in the long run as always guys thanks for watching and I'll see you next time this is level-cap signing off you,10:29

already softened Intel up after the launch of their rise in 3000 series processors but team red is now preparing the knockout punch this is a very very slow boxing match yesterday AMD officially unveiled the first to third gen thread Ripper CPUs the 24 Core 48 thread 39 60 X for $13.99 US dollars and the 32 core 64 thread 39 70 X for 2 grand they're going to launch on November 25th alongside the new king of the mainstream rise lineup the Verizon 939 50 X the first 16 core mainstream desktop processor AMD says that despite the high core count it will still offer the highest single thread performance of any rise in CPU while keeping the same 105 watt TDP of their other high spec rise ins and if some leaked Geekbench members are to be believed the 39 50 X even beats Intel's 10th gen h EDT part the Cry 9 10 9 8 exe in both single and multi core performance despite having to fear course Wow but guys let's not forget the real star of the show here the Athlon 3000 G this $49 dual-core quad threaded part is going to shred everyone else in its price point when it launches on November 19th look guys just because you think it can't doesn't mean it won't never underestimate the little guy that's right US carriers t-mobile and Sprint have been trying to get approval for their merger for a year and a half and now they're trying to sweeten the deal with a bunch of promises that they'll be able to fulfill if regulators let it go through the two companies announced that after their merger they will offer free home internet to ten million low-income households for five years and throw in a free tablet or laptop although they'll only have a hundred gigs of data per year the new t-mobile as the company will appear really be called we'll also offer free unlimited 5g access to every public and nonprofit US state and local police fire and EMS agency and we will provide a new $15 per month prepaid plan with two gigs of data now the merger has been approved by the federal government but it currently faces 16 lawsuits from various states concerned about the move reducing competition as the number of nationwide wireless carriers would go from 4 down to 3 that is a 25 percent reduction as a reminder of what a lack of competition can lead to AT&T recently gave its mobile share customers an extra 15 gigs of data along with a $10 price increase BOM that you can't opt out of well at least we'll get some free stuff on our way down the slippery slope and this week saw the release of some interesting AI tools research nonprofit open AI has made the text generating GPT 2 software available to the public the system can actually write articles based on a human prompt that are impressively well formulated even if they are mostly inaccurate seems like it learned too much from the humans it was a Iying based on so research with GPT 2 showed that humans find its outputs convincing so it's been described as something of a fake news generator opening I previously said that the tool was simply too dangerous to release to the public I mean think of the Facebook posts but now they say that there was no evidence of misuse in their research well I guess not yet anyway in slightly more optimistic news Google released two teachable machine 2.0 this week which lets users train an AI using images video and audio for custom machine learning applications so maybe we could like train an AI to detect whether an article was written by an AI you know keep them focused on each other so that way like Skynet never happens matrix now it's time for the crunchy buns

only realized later that they had a bunch of money burning a hole in their pocket that's just bad planning yesterday tons of people in the US and Canada received text messages that had been sent way

DF-yBAkLFfw,Sam O'Nella Academy,Informative,Fidel Castro's Dairy Adventures,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF-yBAkLFfw,5 years ago,8.7M views,Informative,hey kids let's talk about Fidel Castro we're all familiar with Castro right dictator of Cuba for the whole second half of the 20th century main antagonist of the Cuban Missile Crisis you know anyway this man loves three things he loves Cuba he loves communism and good God does the man love Dairy yep you heard me right the all-powerful dictator of communist Cuba is obsessed with anything related to milk and its derivatives a drupe a little charity rate I called the Lecce lovin ladder at the bottom you got dairy farmers then you got Ross O'Donovan then mr. bones then starving babies and then all the way up at the top here you got Fidel Castro today I'm going to share a few true stories that illustrate his preoccupation okay the first one isn't really the story so much as a fact but according to several sources Castro was known to be able to eat 18 scoops of ice cream after a meal that's more than two pints if that doesn't impress you then go try it for yourself me I can barely manage a pint and a half on an empty stomach and Castro's doing it on top of a full meal but it gets better being such an ice-cream connoisseur Castro ordered the construction of an ice cream shop but this isn't your average everyday parlor not by a long shot he built a straight-up ice cream complex taking up an entire city block this was a piece of modern architecture too in total contrast of the surrounding slums all for the sake of ice cream the place is called Coppelia and it's still open today of course Castro's obsession went beyond just personal pleasure Dairy was so dear to him that it often found its way into diplomatic interactions like one time a French diplomat came to visit so Castro whips out some Cuban cheese specifically though it was camembert cheese a variety that France is famous for French guy was like hey not bad it's almost as good as the French kind try it again I think you'll find it's even better than the French all right I wouldn't say that I'm sorry are you disrespecting my cheese in my house on my island no I mean it's good I just said the French kind is better maybe if you froggy [ __ ] bathed once in a while you'd be able to taste the cheese instead of your own bo listen you've got your cigars we've got our cheese live with it fine [ __ ] him it's good cheese I'm paraphrasing just a little bit that's basically how it went down so already it's obvious that dairy is of great value to Castro most exceptional however is how this value reflected in his leadership naturally having an entire nation at its disposal Castro wanted to bolster the Cuban dairy industry as much as possible but there was one problem Cuba initially had two types of cows called Lorena's and Z pues Lorena's came from the days when Spain ruled Cuba and zaboo's originated from India both of these cows are well suited to the cuban environment having a very high tolerance for heat however they don't produce much milk they're mostly just raised for their meat so Castro decides to import thousands of Holsteins from Canada Holsteins are the classic black and white cows and as we all know you can juice these guys for days they are utterly superior only problem is they're used to living in Canada so when they're plopped down under the scorching Caribbean Sun it's going to stress him out they're not going to be laughing cows by any means so as a result Castro's import still didn't put out enough milk to satisfy his desires at this point your average run-of-the-mill Dairy Queen would have given up for Castro he's more than that he's a dairy dictator so we ordered the construction of a giant air-conditioned complex with the sole purpose of providing a comfortable environment for his Holsteins and it helped a little bit but they were still stressed out they still weren't putting out at their natural levels and as you can imagine climate controlling an entire facility is very expensive so Castro was forced to abandon the project but like the astronaut he is Castro who held on to his dream of finding the Milky Way so he gathered a team of scientists and farmers and ordered them to breed together the Z booze and the Holsteins in order to produce a heat-resistant lactose pumping super cow the breeding efforts were mostly a bust never producing the bovine master-race that Castro longed for however there was one exception under Castro's program a single individual was born that met his expectations with flying colors the cow was named Ruben a Blanca Spanish for white utter and she produced world record-breaking volumes of milk peaking at a hundred and ten liters a day that's more than 29 entire gallons of lactation needless to say Castro was absolutely euphoric at this isolated success of his to say he went ballistic would be an understatement he went intercontinental ballistic like India hasn't got [ __ ] on the levels of cow worship that Castro performed daily updates were published in the Cuban national newspaper describing Obon a Blancas health and productivity and when she died in 1985 Castro commissioned a giant marble statue of the cow in her honor he also had scientists harvest tissue and egg samples for the sake of preserving her DNA after opener Blancas death Castro's plans for the Cuban dairy industry got even more desperate and ridiculous somehow this is based off of an actual conversation that he had with this team of scientists in 1987 ok guys hear me out what if we make cows that are the size of dogs so that way they can live in people's apartments with them Fidel I I don't think that's gonna work no no no no it'll work you just have to grow grass in the apartment too you can't be serious yeah you just got to put up some fluorescent lights BAM little a little a little grazing patch for your doggy cow you are a [ __ ] lunatic and obviously nothing ever came with that idea and Cuba's dairy industry is still floundering today sadly so yeah if you haven't gotten the picture by now the dude likes milk imagine he's at the birth of his grandson right ah what a beautiful baby boy ah Fidel there's something we need to tell you your grandson he's lactose intolerant prepare the firing squad anyway there's plenty of other miscellaneous stories surrounding his little preoccupation like the time the CIA tried to poison his milkshake so I just decided to highlight a few big ones anyway that's all for today until next time I'm salmonella and thank you for watching,6:20
puMYeBRTsHs,LGR,VideoGames,LGR's Best (and Worst) Sims 3 Packs,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puMYeBRTsHs,7 years ago,2M views,VideoGames,"*mechanical keyboard typing* You know, ever since I started reviewing all of these some years ago, I have gotten one question about The Sims 3 more than any other and that is which expansion pack is the best? Which one's the crappiest? How does this one compare to this other one? And, you know, until they were all out I had no way of really answering that properly but now that they're all here and it's done and The Sims 4 is on its way I figured it's as good a time as any to take a look back at all the Sims 3 expansion packs and Stuff Packs and put them in some sort of arbitrary subjective list that I would put together if I were to do so, and I just did, so let's watch it. First we're gonna start at my Expansion Pack list and we're gonna go from the very worst to the best and then we'll do the Stuff Packs after that So, let's get straight to #11 Showtime The pack at the very bottom of my list is here for good reason: It was completely unnecessary! Not just because of the Katy Perry connection, I don't give two craps about her being on the cover or not, w hat bothered me was that we already had Late Night before this and Showtime was basically the same thing with a slightly different coat of paint. I didn't find the new careers fun, didn't care for the online social features, Simport was a mess, and the genie was just kind of there. This was just completely forgettable and was the first expansion I uninstalled immediately after reviewing it. #10 Supernatural All right, I know several are going to send me hate mail for this, but whatever! As I said in my review, I just don't care for these creepy and kooky mysterious and spooky paranormal Packs. I did like some of the outfits and the goth-infused items but the rest of it, I never played with ever again. My style of play is more grounded in reality and whenever you start tossing in fantasy elements, you lose me. Give me a spin-off game if you're going to do that! And, holy crap, where those zombies annoying or what? Maybe they were after brains so much because whoever made it so that you couldn't initially disable them needed a brain, badly. #9 Into the Future Freakin' time travel! OK, Sims team, you done jumped the shark on this one. It's silly, over-the-top, and downright sub-par as far as things it adds that I actually find fun. Traveling to utopian and dystopian futures and messing with sci-fi fantasy objects can be a fun gimmick, but for me the charm wore off quickly and it became more of a nuisance than a really compelling way to play. Building your own androids is easily the best part of the Pack but the fact that you can then bring these overpowered superbeings into the main game totally broke my immersion. #8 World Adventures When this first came out, I was not impressed at all because it made The Sims 3 feel like more of a spin-off of the life simulator it should have been. It added objectives, progression, and adventure end goals that, to me, didn't belong in this type of sandbox game. However, as time went on I really started to appreciate the fact that it provided three distinct new areas to explore that differend from the rest of the game and it broke up the monotony of living a normal life and let me explore tombs like some sort of Indiana Jones with bladder control problems. It's not a bad pack at all, actually, it's just not my cup of tea 100% of the time. #7 Pets The only reason this is not higher on my list is the fact that I am not a huge pets person. I love my pets in real life, but I just don't have much fun keeping up with them in The Sims. I'd rather just make Duke Nukem and attempt to woo-hoo the entire town instead of spending all my time training Fido to not take a million dumps on everything. Unicorns were pretty cool I guess, if only because they were Hell's minions in disguise, but I just don't care much for this one otherwise. The only thing that kept it installed on my hard drive was the town itself, which had this cool neverending fall aesthetic. Also, that ice cream truck still creeps me out and I wish it would just crash into a telephone pole and explode. #6 Island Paradise I've gotta be honest, the only reason this isn't closer to the bottom of the list is because of my own life experiences. Having lived on an island in the Caribbean myself in real life, the fact that you could finally have a bit of that lifestyle in The Sims 3 was just awesome to me. Otherwise this Pack is kind of forgettable with only houseboats, SCUBA diving, and running your own hotel being the highlights and all of them can be lived without in your game quite easily. It also broke the playability of the game after extended use for some people, myself included, so use with caution. #5 Ambitions If you think about how much time your Sim spends at work, or messing around with random hobbies and skill-building at home, it makes sense that an Expansion adding to both of these would come highly recommended. New careers, expanded base game careers, new hobbies and skills, tattooing, thrift shops, and freaking detonation made for quite the enjoyable Expansion Pack in my eyes. And it came with a whole new town that I felt was nicely designed and I used it quite a bit. It's all the kind of stuff I think of when I think ""Expansion Pack"" without delving into the territory of fantasy or paranormal silliness and that makes it well worth it to me. #4 Generations I am well aware that some people don't like this one much, and I can see why. You only get the most bang for your buck from this if you play with families and Sims of all ages and several of the new additions seem minor or were added to the base game through a free patch anyway. But while I can certainly live without a lot of the stuff it adds, it just fleshes out so much of the game and adds so many new interactions and options that it feels like a very worthwhile addition. Basically, Generations is all stuff that should have been in the base game to begin with, and that's either a good or a bad thing depending on how cynical you are. #3 University Life As you might have understood by now, I really enjoy the opportunity to do something a little different from the normal routine in The Sims, provided it's also pretty realistic and doesn't go overboard. And University Life is the best example of that in my opinion for The Sims 3. Your Sims aged young adult and older can attend college and enjoy all that that entails including copious amounts of streaking and experimenting with mood-altering substances. It's chock-full of new activities, items, and skills, and the pace is just different enough from the normal gameplay that it's a great distraction from the virtual rat race of the rest of the game. #2 Late Night This was my favorite Pack for a long time for one simple reason: Cities. I love cities! I love tall buildings, I love the city lifestyle, I love the high-rise apartments you can live in here, and I really dug the new dive bars and night clubs. It's a shame that most of the time they were completely empty and that the celebrity system was more of a pain than fun for very long largely due to the stupid paparazzi that never went away. It also had vampires that were less involved than those in Supernatural but I didn't care.  I just wanted to walk around the city and enjoy the downtown ambience and get fat off of food trucks. And #1 Seasons If you saw my review for this, you'll know that this is one of the few Packs that seriously drew me in right at the beginning and got me excited for The Sims 3 again. I loved seasons in The Sims 2, and they were even  better here. Rain, snow, summer, autumn, holidays, aliens, this was just an all-around enjoyable Expansion Pack and I didn't hate any of it. In fact, I thought it was the one that changed the absolute most about the game no matter how you choose to play because weather is such an intrinsic part of everyday life in both The Sims and the real world. Weather changes moods, changes plans, changes smalltalk conversation topics. It's just something that should always be in a life simulator, and I approve 100%. And now it's on to the Stuff Packs, and as you might have guessed if you saw my reviews of those, I don't particularly care for any one of them too much mainly because the price is ridiculous for what you get. But, whatever, here are my best and worst and this time we're going the opposite direction; we're starting with my favorite and ending with my least favorite. Let's get straight to #1 High-End Loft Stuff Yeah, go figure that the very first Stuff Pack they released would also end up being the best and it would all go downhill from here. Even though I wasn't super psyched about it to begin with, it added several items that I frequently used and brought back some from The Sims 1 as well, which makes this my favorite Stuff Pack. #2 Fast Lane Stuff Cars are awesome, garages are awesome, and rockabilly music is awesome. And yeah, Sims still teleported inside of these cars but that's more the fault of the base game, not this pack. Plus, the Norwegian version of this was called Full Fart and that still makes me laugh. #3 70s, 80s, & 90s Stuff I still don't know why they didn't just call this Decades Stuff, but whatever. It's three of my favorite decades in one Pack.  What's not to love? Well, other than the fact that it left out a lot of stuff that was super iconic from those decades, and many items just look generic but whatever, it still had its place and it came with some  really cool music. #4 Town Life Stuff This was pretty much just a bunch of prebuilt lots but nonetheless I had fun making my own phallic town using it in conjunction with the Create-A-World tool. And while the lots it came with didn't add anything new to the game, they still look pretty cool, at least if you're into that type of modern architecture. #5 Outdoor Living Stuff All sorts of stuff for living outdoors and some stuff for the almost-outdoors, pretty boring as far as premises go, but I also ended up using several of these items in my houses throughout the years and farting on non-drinkable lemonade side, it could have been worse. #6 Master Suite Stuff My, my, what a Stuff Pack! Sure, all it added were eye masks and a bunch of stuff for your bedroom, and the best I can say is, at least most of it looked half-decent. But honestly the greatest part about this pack were the item names full of innuendo and sexual connotations. ""Glamour Puss"" and ""Delicate Dangling Participle""? Ooh, yeah, talk dirty to me Sims team! #7 Movie Stuff Generic cosplay outfits and nonfunctioning decor items, meh! I can't say I've ever used anything from this pack beyond what I did for the review except for maybe the Dr. Frank-N-Furter outfit just to amuse myself when everything else got boring. #8 Diesel Stuff Ugh, son of a nutsack, what a waste of hard drive space this was! I didn't care about the brand and half the items were downright hideous. Not only that, but many of them didn't let you change their style so even if you did like the mesh, you were stuck with some awful texture on top of it. and finally #9 Katy Perry's Sweet Treats Ah, yes, the Sweet Treats House of Pain and me eating the artwork at the end of the review. Need I say more? Yes, in fact, I do, because this was an atrocity and represents all of the worst aspects of the Sims series from the lazy item design to the stupidly high price to the hamfisted cash-grab nature of its half-hearted celebrity endorsement. Sweet Treats made me fear for the future of a series that I love and it also makes me shed a malcontent tear knowing that sealed copies now sell for upwards of $70. And knowing that even when I bashed this thing to hell and back that might have actually made some people want it more which makes me feel like a bad person. Screw this Pack; I hope I forget about it. And that is all for my best and worst of the Sims 3 Expansion Packs. Stay tuned for my full review of The Sims 4 on this channel shortly after it comes out. All of these are gonna be dirt cheap soon now that The Sims 4 is coming out on September 2nd 2014 so if you've missed any of these and anything that I said sounded intriguing, maybe it's a good idea to keep a lookout for some sales and grab it as long as it's not Sweet Treats. Ah, but whatever, they stop manufacturing that anyway which is just good for the betterment of humanity. And if you want more in the meantime, there are plenty of videos on my channel covering The Sims 3, The Sims 2, 4, and 1, and whatever else I happen to cover which is a lot of stuff; I make new videos every single week so subscribing is not only very appreciated, but would help you get more content to hopefully enjoy. And you can also interact with me and other Simmers on Twitter and Facebook as well as support LGR on Patreon which lets you not only support the show but also provides perks like being able to see videos there before anywhere else at all. And, as always, I thank you very much for watching.",12:35

CCkPhYiKbJU,videogamedunkey,VideoGames,Old Dunkey and Cuphead,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCkPhYiKbJU,4 years ago,11M views,VideoGames,"Before YouTube, there was Newgrounds where a bunch of kids brought their ideas to life with cartoons. If this can be considered animation, then I was one of those kids, trying to make something special for people to watch on the internet. Let's take a look at one of my first videos: ""The great Yoshi Migration"", uploaded on December 1st, 2003. What the fuck was that piece of shit? I created it, and I don't understand what the fuck just happened there. Now in the sequel here, If you look to the left side, you can actually see the Yoshi continually running in place, because I didn't know how to change the size of the screen. And then I hit you with the scrolling text, except you see the end of the sentence first, so that kind of ruins everything. It wasn't until 2004, where I would seek the help of the commenters. Here the description is: “Tell me what you like and dislike [aobut] this movie.” As you can imagine, the comments were very insightful. da07panther said: ""GAY"" “Fuck you, fuck you. I'm Italian.” I noticed all the best animations on the internet featured talented casts of voice actors and beautiful, crisp drawings of original characters. So...I made this. Critics were blown away by my ultra-realistic drawing of Yoda, but that's not even the impressive part, watch this: Yoda: ""When do I start? [unnhNNnn] He said Monday. True story it is. Then Wayne the Goblin try to steal my butterfinger."" Didja hear what happened there? I swapped out the voice actor for Yoda in the middle of the scene. And you're only gonna get that kind of professionalism from a guy like me. Needless to say, people loved it. They said it was the best that they've ever seen, so I knew that in the sequel, I would have to up the ante. Apparently, Yoda: ""I'M A YODA"" ""DIIIIIEEEEEEEEE!"" ""A-Venge Myf a ther's death."" *Blood-curdling battle cry* Now I have to put a disclaimer on this next part, because no man, woman, or child should ever see this in their entire life. Please, everyone, turn this off now, and leave. For the love of God, just, please- Megaman: ""It's always fun at the F-U-C-K, It's always fun at the F-U-C-K"" *Dunkey takes a deep and painful sigh* This is a, uh... parody of the song by the Village People. Except I swapped out the letters YMCA for... ""Fuck"". I have to put an additional disclaimer here... because, what you are about to s- hear, can never be unheard. Please... Please turn the video off. ""When you walk in the street, and a ninja jumps down, you say to his face;"" ""Hey, yo, fuck you man. What?"" ""F-U-C-K chucka-dun chucka-dun
chucka-dun chucka-dun"" ...if anyone still viewing this has the technology, I am willing to go back in time, and assassinate my own self before this was uploaded. All right, one more. Just- just one more. Now this is one of my oldest masterpieces, called ""Up My Ass"", here we go. Left Cat: ""EY BOB. Ey why don't ya tell me the old story o' when you bought that frog fuckin' thing on your fucking head, why don'tcha?"" [unintelligible 13 year old noises]
Right Cat: ""awwellddatell da story of da frog thing on mah hed UP MY ASS."" The reason why I've taken you on this elongated intro is really to acclimate you with what animation looks like, when you don't have the patience or talent for it. Even though I'm probably the worst animator worldwide, I've been doing this shit since I was 12 years old, so I know all the tricks, I know all the cheats, and I have a huge appreciation for quality stuff like you'll see in Cuphead. These guys have really gone about nailing the look of this game in the most pain-in-the-ass, time-consuming way possible, and it looks absolutely stunning for it. Documentary: ""The thousands of pencil drawings go to the inking department."" ""Here, hundreds of pretty girls, in a comfortable building all their own,"" ""well-lighted, air-conditioned throughout, cover the drawings with sheets of transparent celluloid."" Dunkey: Every single boss is this impossible combination of precisely-detailed drawings and fluid animation. Let's just slow this down a little and look at how many times they had to draw this flower guy on the right here. [Counting]
1, 2, 3, [Counting still.]
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, [Skipped a few, but still counting]
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, [More counting]
24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 32, 33, 34, 35, Okay, now- let's just play that back real quick. In two and a half seconds, they had to draw that flower guy 35 different times. This is why you should never be an animator. In general, these boss fights are around two minutes long, and i'd assume in that time you'll see around 300 different frames of animation per boss. That means 300 times drawing, inking, and coloring the one guy over there. For this reason, the art direction of Cuphead has been universally praised. The difficulty of the game, however, has come under some criticism. And to be completely honest, I am NOT the best guy at video games. I can't beat Castlevania, I can't beat Punch-Out, and I especially can't beat Contra, okay? And the first thing you need to know about Cuphead is that this game is a fuckin' Dickhead. I'd say it's right on the border of ""Complete Horseshit"" and ""Go Fuck Yourself"". In a game where every millisecond counts, the frame-by-frame animation is a perfect match. The player is forced to carefully observe the boss while attempting to dodge 50 projectiles at the same time. The genius part is because the bosses are so detailed, the way they telegraph their attacks can range from incredibly obvious to frustratingly subtle, while still being fair. On the other hand, there is a level of randomness in a couple boss fights, that can sometimes cheat the player out of a hit. Usually with attacks that are kinda disconnected from what the boss is visually doing. Also, some of these upgrades feel more like downgrades to me. Steam says it took me 13 hours to beat this game, so, 7 hours on this dumb fucking dragon, uhh, 4 hours on this piece of shit bumblebee boss, and then the rest of the game was probably about an hour long. ""Persistence"" is the key word. Going back to Newgrounds, there was so many moments when I was a kid, that I thought I had something really special. I worked so hard, for months on some of those movies, and when I finally put them up the reception was ""GAY"" and that was crushing for me, but for some reason I kept going back again, and again, and again, and eventually, EVENTUALLY, I got better. After 7 rage quits, 13 controller throws, 28 angry comments directed at the developers, I got better at the game. So for those of you who've thrown in the towel at this point? I'm saying; try it again, man. You can do it. You really gotta parry those pink attacks, because that's gonna chop off a significant portion of the fight, and, you gotta equip the Smoke Bomb and the Scattershot. Especially the Smoke Bomb, this thing is like 100 times better than every other power up. There are moments in Cuphead, where you'll say: ""Fuck this game."", ""This is bullshit."" and trust me, some parts in here really are bullshit. But there's so much love put into these boss fights that you can't just walk away! You gotta see it all, you gotta beat it all, and... you gotta buy my new hotdogs. I give Cupfoot... a 4 out of 5.",7:34
r7qliVpGEk0,VICE,News,Underground LSD Palace,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7qliVpGEk0,9 years ago,20M views,News,"HAMILTON MORRIS: Dearest
Krystle, I cannot express the excitement within me when I
think that shortly we will meet face to face. Over the years, I've read your
books and watched your videos, perused court documents,
police records, and affidavits, yet I still feel
confused about what happened between you, Todd, and the LSD
laboratory so many years ago. I hope that when we are
together, I will finally understand what transpired,
and the truth will shine brightly as a crystal
in the Kansas sky. Much love, Hamilton. Krystle Cole is one of the most
unlikely figures in the psychedelic community. A Goth stripper from Kansas
whose introduction to the psychedelic underground came in
February of 2000, when she fell deeply in love with a
mysterious man named Todd, who was the heir to a spring
manufacturing fortune. She quit her job as a dancer
and moved in with Todd at a decommissioned nuclear missile
silo that served as his private pleasure of
lysergic delights. Exactly what happened in that
laboratory at the dawn of the new millennium is still a
subject of heated debate. But it is known that Todd formed
a partnership with Leonard Pickard, an accomplished
clandestine psychedelic chemist. And together they began to
assemble what would have been the world's largest LSD lab. But before the lab could be put
into full operation, it was destroyed by the DEA. After verifying that my
intentions were pure, Krystle agreed to meet with me to
discuss her involvement in the lab and take me on a guided tour
of the subterranean LSD palace that she once
called home. Last night we flew into Kansas
City, and right now we're on our way to meet Krystle Cole. Outside of what she's written in
her book, Lysergic, and her numerous YouTube videos,
there's very little known about her. I have a lot of questions. I've wanted to meet her
for a long time. Here we are. Hey, what's going on? It's Hamilton. Nice to meet you. KRYSTLE COLE: I was raised in a
small Kansas town, which is comparable to being sucked into
a spiritual black hole. I was surrounded by flat, bleak
cornfields farmed by similarly flat, bleak people. At a young age, my classmates
labeled me as a nerd, causing me to never quite fit in. The first thing that comes to
mind upon reflection is, thank god for being an outcast. My peers were the perfect
example of white trash at its worst. The majority of them had already
given birth to a couple children and dropped
out of high school because of it. No aspirations existed in their
minds beyond the next round of incestuous
sex, six-pack of beer, and line of meth. HAMILTON MORRIS: Krystle is
one of very few people surrounding the bust who is not
currently incarcerated. And in the wake of extraordinary
heartbreak, trials, and prison sentences,
she used her life experience to inspire a variety of
informational YouTube videos that have garnered much
attention across the internet. KRYSTLE COLE: So this is the
green screen that I use to shoot all the NeuroSoup
videos. So I came up with the name
NeuroSoup because it's basically the combination of
neurology and then the soup, we all have this soup of
different neurotransmitters in our brains. And so drugs affect these
neurotransmitters, and so that's kind of how I came up
with the name NeuroSoup. HAMILTON MORRIS: Mm. You were saying that your most
popular YouTube video is the Shamanic Colonic
anal DMT video. -Hi. Some people have gotten onto the
NeuroSoup forum and asked me about the time that
I took DMT anally. And so today I want to describe
that for you guys. There are some benefits to it. I've only done it anally once,
because I guess the negative side effect to it, while I'm
talking about all the positives, is that it burned
really bad, and it just kind of put me in this weird
head space. KRYSTLE COLE: That was my most
popular one until YouTube forced me to remove it because
of its new community content guidelines. There's some other paintings
and more paintings and more fractals. I kind of have them on
the walls everywhere. And of course, Grateful
Dead bears. That one is the one that I put
on my first edition of Lysergic book cover. It's my favorite one. And the language around the side
of it are things that I kind of saw when I was
tripping, these alienesque-type languages. I don't know what you
would call it. HAMILTON MORRIS: Can you talk
about just the things you talk about the beginning of Lysergic,
how you initially got involved in all of this? KRYSTLE COLE: Yeah, well, I
met Todd at a strip club. I worked there for about
three months. And he came in-- well, actually, one of
his employees came in and saw me first. And then they went back, and
they said, oh, there's this girl down there you should
see, kind of thing. So then he came and met me. And shortly thereafter, I was
driving one of his Porsches and living at his
missile site. HAMILTON MORRIS: I asked Krystle
to take me on a tour of the silo, which is now
owned by a vintage tank enthusiast. It will be the first time
Krystle has entered the silo since her romance with Todd. When Todd was seducing
you, what kinds of things would he say? KRYSTLE COLE: Oh, boy. I don't know. Um, at first he was
very gentlemanly. It wasn't like he was drugging
me and taking advantage or anything. At first he was being the utmost
gentleman, to try to win my trust over. HAMILTON MORRIS: On the way,
we passed the place Krystle and Todd first met-- Club Orleans, one of Topeka's
premier exotic dance establishments. KRYSTLE COLE: This was the club
that I met Todd, although it was a different
name back then. They've kind of remodeled
since then. I did kind of an interesting
act. I did a bondage act. And so I-- really stood out for the Kansas
crowd that's in there. I would play death metal music,
and I had this, like, chain that I would hold around
my neck with a dog collar. I'd wrap it around the pole
and stuff, and I'd whip myself on stage. I was really into
Goth back then. Because I really hated Kansas,
and I was just rebelling against everything that this
whole place was about. And so he comes in there. He was sort of like
the mad scientist. If you can imagine, like, a guy
walking around with this big metal briefcase,
you know, bald-- and his hair, like, what hair
is left sticking up everywhere. His clothes rattered,
tattered everywhere. He would come in there and just
sit with me and pay me like lots and lots of money just
to hang out in the VIP room with him. And he would sit there
for the whole day. And we did that for
a couple of times. And then he's like, well, why
don't you just come out to where I live, and stuff? And I was like, well, OK. I'll go out to your
place with you. They have a policy where you're
not supposed to leave with customers. You're not supposed
to do that. And I never would have done
that, but Todd was so persuasive. And so, I kind of gave in. I probably shouldn't have. If I wouldn't have met him, I
wouldn't have had all this horrible stuff happen. But I also wouldn't have had
all the cool stuff happen. He drove Porsches and
had lots of money. And, you know, he bought me
Armani clothes and gave me money, and I didn't
have to work at the strip club anymore. So I was like, hey,
let's party. I didn't care. I'm kind of excited to see what
it looks like in there. I think it's going to bring
back a lot of memories. HAMILTON MORRIS: As we drew
near the legendary missile silo, I tried to imagine Krystle
arriving here with Todd for the very first time. KRYSTLE COLE: You used to have
to call in using this system right there, or you'd
have an access code. HAMILTON MORRIS: Upon entering
this silo, Krystle left the spiritual black hole of Kansas
behind forever and was introduced to Todd and Leonard's
underground ring of chemists, dealers, and drug
enforcement agents. KRYSTLE COLE: These tunnels
are really fun when you're tripping, because they'll start
swirling on you and you'll be, like, hanging
on, like, ahh! HAMILTON MORRIS: And what was
your experience with drugs before having met Gordon
""Todd"" Skinner? KRYSTLE COLE: Virtually none. Of course, I did the normal
drinking alcohol, smoking pot. I tried meth twice and
I did coke once. But other than that-- I'd never even heard of MDMA. I didn't even know
what it was. All I know is, he's like, it'll
make you feel good. Just try it. You like it. Don't worry. You'll like it. And boy, did I. Back then, I was on so many
different substances. It was like living in an
entheogenic monastery, because I didn't have to work. I didn't have to worry
about paying bills. I didn't have to do anything
other than use psychedelics and pray to the god
that we all share. The whole situation was centered
around tripping, so we just wanted to
be comfortable. This here is the missile bay. About where the tanks are is
where we had a platform set up with a stereo, and we would have
a couple of king-sized beds in here and a bunch of
different couches, like leather couches and things. That way we could hang out and
have plenty of places to sit down and lay down or whatever. HAMILTON MORRIS: Todd spent
money with wild abandon, decorating the silo with stone
statues, Persian carpets, cedar saunas, a marble bathroom
with a tub large enough to accommodate a
half-dozen people, and a $120,000 stereo system, which
he used to play both Sarah McLachlan and Deep Forest at
extremely high volumes. [MUSIC PLAYING] KRYSTLE COLE: Yeah, we would
all get in here and shower. There was lots of nudity. You can imagine, you
know, lots of cute girls running around. And the parties were-- could
get really wild. One of the things they really
liked to do was have IVs set up and have some DMT or some
5-MeO in the IV bottle. They would sit there, and then
they would like, crank it up so they'd start tripping more. And then they'd roll it down
a little bit to kind of-- and so you could, like-- he
would like surf in the DMT high, you know? I would do a lot,
but not that. Todd seemed like the most
spiritual person you would ever meet. And when we would trip
together, it was like, I don't know. Tripping with him is different
than tripping with anyone I've ever tripped with, you know? And we experienced things like
telepathy together, and you know, we experienced
God, if you want to label it that, together. HAMILTON MORRIS: Krystle was
exposed to a cornucopia of psychedelic substances, ranging
from the more common chemicals like LSD, DMT, and
MDMA to such rarities as ALD-52, ergot wine, a variety
of fluorinated AMT analogs, and a mysterious substance
made by Leonard called diazedine. Unbeknownst to Krystle, Todd
and Leonard began to argue, and Todd was slowly overcome by
fear of both Leonard and an impending bust by the DEA. KRYSTLE COLE: Todd was so
secretive about everything. A couple weeks before the bust
happened, he gave me some MDMA and said, go in the bedroom and
trip and leave me alone. Don't come out here. So I was like, pretty high,
and I came out there, and like, what are you doing? I'm bored. And so then I got to
see all the stuff. He had pictures of Leonard and
all this stuff about Leonard, like this huge file on him. Looking back on it, I should've
known something was getting ready to come down when
he had all that stuff out, because then I could
have said, Leonard, you gotta watch out. KSNT REPORTER: Wamego residents
say they were shocked when DEA agents arrived
into town on November 6, looking for drug fugitives. HAMILTON MORRIS: In October
2000, Todd formally contacted the DEA and declared that he
would like to turn in the world's largest LSD
manufacturing conspiracy. Todd received total immunity for
his involvement with the laboratory and walked away a
free man, while Leonard was chased by the DEA, outrunning
them on foot and hiding in a barn with his body covered
with cold leaves to evade thermal cameras. The following day, Leonard was
turned in by a farmer and eventually given two concurrent
life sentences without parole. MALE SPEAKER: Wamego Police
Department were brought in to assist in the manhunt, which
ended up being an 18-hour hunt for the individual. KSNT REPORTER: DEA agents
believe the LSD lab is one of the largest in the world. HAMILTON MORRIS: After the
bust, Krystle and Todd traveled across the country for
three years with a small group of ravers and drug
enthusiasts, selling phosphorescent capsules of
MDMA and living like psychedelic royalty in Seattle, Mendocino, Tucson, and Tulsa. KRYSTLE COLE: Here's our
California house. We had our own private
beach down there. We would try to get the best
we could everywhere. HAMILTON MORRIS: There were
peacocks on the property? KRYSTLE COLE: Yeah. Yeah. There were peacocks
on the property. You would think having
peacocks would be cool, but it wasn't. Outside of our houses was
all these Amanitas. And so we would go pick
Amanitas and stuff. You can see us, we're
identifying them and researching them. Some of these don't have Todd in
them, because he didn't let us take a lot of pictures. There towards the end, I think
all the stress of the court case, and everything, you know,
the years of running, and the years of all the
problems, you know, just really were piling in on him. And I think that he was
just kind of going a little bit crazy. Todd was very much escalating
things. He started abusing me,
like literally physically abusing me. I was willing to look over some
of the bad stuff that I started to see the first couple
years, because, oh, I know underneath all this,
it's just the stress. It's just temporary. Underneath all that, he's this
beautiful, spiritual person. And he's doing all this
for good reasons. And now looking back on
it, no, he was just manipulating me. I was-- I was just a stupid girl. You know? He always had a couple of
other girlfriends, and I always had boyfriends. And we were each other's
primary, you know, I mean, but like we always had other
people around. And so the boyfriend at the
time, Brad, he was the first guy over the years that I dated
that wanted-- that said, look, this situation's
no good. You need to get away
from this. And so, so I'm like, OK, well,
the only way for us to get out of this is for us to go to the
DEA and basically do what Todd did to Leonard to Todd. And so we go to the DEA
together, and we basically spill everything about Todd's
local operation that he's got going there. They were already familiar with
the Pickard case and all that stuff. And so they knew who I was, that
I was Todd's girlfriend and all that. They had a case. They had me. They had the boyfriend. And I told them where
one of his labs was. So they had more than enough
of a case, and more than enough of a reason
to go after him. You know what they said to me? They're like, well, we'll
give you a call. And I'm like, OK. And so they had my
phone number. So I go home. And then conveniently, two days
later, Todd called me up. Well, I know you went
into the DEA. HAMILTON MORRIS: So you
went into the DEA. You told them that
he was dangerous. They took down all
the information. Didn't do anything at
all to stop him. But told him that you had
reported him and just infuriated him? KRYSTLE COLE: Yes. And that is why he kidnapped me
and Brad and did the things that he did to us. HAMILTON MORRIS: On the 4th of
July, 2003, believing he was immune to legal prosecution,
Todd lured Krystle and Brad to the Tulsa Doubletree Inn. Shortly after meeting, Todd
offered Brad a communion wafer laced with an unknown
psilocin analog. KRYSTLE COLE: The next thing I
know, he's duct-taped up, and they were injecting
him with stuff. And they were telling me, you
know, if you don't obey everything we say, we're going
to give him something that's going to kill him. And we have to get information
out of him. We have to know what he said. HAMILTON MORRIS: As the drug
took effect, Todd taped Brad up and spent one week subjecting
him to psychedelic tortures of unfathomable
depravity. KRYSTLE COLE: I know that he
was giving him stuff like barbiturates and things
like Valium and stuff. HAMILTON MORRIS: But
he was using psychedelics as a truth serum? KRYSTLE COLE: Yeah. And he was using psychedelics
as well. He was giving him IV DMT. Any drug he had, he pretty much
was giving it to him. You know, and after that, after
it was over, I had to stay with Todd for
a whole month. And I mean, he drugged me, he
raped me, he sodomized me, he did horrible things to me. It's hard for me to talk about,
because I have PTSD now because of what he did. But I mean, it's horrendous. I mean, to think that somebody
would use psychedelics for the kinds of things he
used them for. HAMILTON MORRIS: Todd fled to
Burning Man, where he was arrested for MDMA distribution
and ultimately tried for kidnapping and assault with
a dangerous weapon. For these acts, Todd was
sentenced to life in prison. KRYSTLE COLE: Todd was so tall
that he had to really watch out for those things, or he
would hit his head on them. KRYSTLE COLE: Yeah. He has life, so you don't have
to worry about him coming back and haunting the place here. Once you trip a lot, you can
make any trip a pleasant experience. Unless the person's literally
standing above you and injecting you and strangling
and threatening you and yelling at you and stuff. You can't-- there's no way
to make that good. The last few years have been a
difficult road for me to walk down, yet they have made me
a much better person. I got so far out of touch with
a normal person's reality. For years, I never worked a job,
watched television, or even went a week without
being around someone who was on an entheogen. I basically had to start
life all over. I began watching the news to
get up to speed on current events, got an apartment of my
own, and started a business to support myself. I feel like even after four
years, I'm still working on reintegrating into society. In the spirit of actually doing
something with what I've learned through entheogens, I
founded a nonprofit website called NeuroSoup.com. My hope is that it will be a
place for people to learn, share their beliefs about
spirituality, entheogens, and themselves. Namaste. HAMILTON MORRIS: After
everything that has transpired, Krystle still
considers Todd the love of her life. We are all brothers in the
family of humanity, and life is a cosmic giggle on the
breath of the universe. Namaste.",19:21
qXUJSCZiU48,Linus Tech Tips,Tech,The All-ROG Gaming PC!,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXUJSCZiU48,2 years ago,8.5M views,Tech,"I'm probably not the only one who's noticed at this point that a soos ROG makes so many different gaming PC components that you could pretty much build an entire system with nothing but ROG stuff so when a soos reached out to sponsor a video for Intel's gamer days which is gonna have giveaways deals on components desktops and laptops starting August 30th we figured why don't we try to finally do it so in front of me is all the components of what Anthony and I hope is going to be the ultimate test rog gaming system that we had ever built and of course pretty much everything in front of us has that one important feature that everyone everyone needs [Music] so as always our build starts with safety first rolling out the gamers Nexus mod mat so we can get started on our machine so at the court oh is of course gonna be our ROG Maximus 11 code motherboard so this is the one that we've been using on our Intel test bench basically ever since Intel launched the 9900 K I guess yeah ever since said 390 it's honestly been a solid board I haven't had any complaints at all and this has been through plenty of both CPU and GPU testing not this one in particular this one this one's new but this model of motherboard that's that's the main point right all right let's pull out all this it's okay it's just plastic so to install on our board we've gone with the core I 999 hundred K so do you want to walk us through why we chose this particular model because it gives us that extra bit of flexibility with Intel Quick Sync so say you're a content creator it actually integrates pretty well but the Adobe suite right now that is a point in Intel's favor as far as CPUs go also it is still a little bit faster for gaming it's not you know the major leap that it used to be but that plus a relatively mature platform I think this is a pretty solid platform to build from so next up we've got our memory and we're actually doing a pretty craptastic job of using our G components here aren't we because this is for only one four three so far they don't actually make our OD memory yet but this memory is or a sync compatible which is very important since it is our GB memory so this is G skills Trident z RGB 3200 C 14 kit it's actually Intel XMP ready and these are 16 gig dims which is going to give us a total of 64 gigs of RGB goodness in our finished system delicious overkill that is so far over the top that it's not even funny I think we even have a video planned in the next little bit sort of demonstrating that this much memory is completely unnecessary for gaming wow we're making excellent progress here so do you want to get the case fired up while I try to figure out this cooler I've never actually this is the part where we can paralyze things a little bit this has been kind of a single-threaded task up until now yeah humor it's funny cuz hyper-threading and actually there is something I need to do while you're working on that I get these nvme drives installed so once again not actually an ROG component so we got a couple of 970 Pro one terabyte drives we're gonna be running these in raid zero for that maximum performance so this is interesting with just one screw you can actually install both of these SSDs oh yeah that's a neat feature in fact it appears as though you don't actually need it at all you can just chuck this thing on top of it and it'll just hold it into place I don't really want to do that though so I'm gonna see if I can find that mounting screw in the box oh wow I actually have not seen a Seuss's ROG chassis before yes it has what they call super comfortable handles and they're actually not bad yeah I was gonna say they're they they're okay I wouldn't call them super comfortable I think the handle is on the other end okay that's something you might justify calling super made a fabric instead of sharp metal I was wondering what that was let's see they got these little buttons here actually I play vastly prefer the latch system for these kinds of things cuz I'm always super terrified of tempered glass shattering when screwing and like a screw into it yeah everything in here actually feels pretty good so this is a soos is HIGHlarious cooler that not only has our GB built in but it also has a display because that is what everyone needs it's funny it's not even the only component in here that has a display oh that's right doesn't their power so if I have an OLED display on the side yeah and I think the motherboard might also okay check this thing out so you've got your copper base at the bottom and then you've got your standard ASA Tech mounting ring system you've got your pomp up here but then asus has gone and built like a multi-level parking structure on top of it so you've got a cooling fan down here and then you've got this PCB up here that there you go handles both the RGB lighting and the built-in display like most cases usually have their drive bays in behind the motherboard tray here and yet in this case you have all the drive trays arranged in such a way that you can have all the cables running parallel with the rest of the cables in the system so it's a lot cleaner back here okay this is the rog Ora terminal it's an RGB hub but what has got me stammering right now is that it comes with a wall plug what please tell me it can be powered internally okay so the wall plug is for external case lighting and the 4-pin yeah well no no it's actually got a four pin Mike molex to DC adapter perfect so so while Anthony is working its way through the RGB stuff I'm trying to figure out how to hold all three of these fans in place while light position the radiator under them and get my hand out yeah so I can mount the rad up in the top now I could ask Anthony for help but he's really busy working on important things well I'm just you know doing cooling stuff you don't need cooling if you have our GP not if you've got aesthetic who do I sound like looks and form factors all that matters don't need cooling Steve Jobs no he cared did he steve wozniak care at times okay I guess he did why he did make sure this computers at least worked were those the fans that came with it yeah it comes with industrial PVC fence I didn't know that yeah it's freaking awesome so a soos is the one company that's just like you know what Knox what makes the best fans why are we why are we not just using them in our a I oh I was getting ready to put like sticky pads on this but it's actually exactly the right size for a drive bay oh it's two-and-a-half-inch yeah oh that's cool it actually has to dress the holes too oh that's cool those of you who have watched any of our build guides before probably noticed that I ran all of these power leads for the fans towards the back of the case so that when we connect them they're all at the back where we won't notice them now we've got the world's longest USB to cable this is coming off the CPU cooler that gives me a lot of options for routing oh that's that's potentially a problem how many USB two headers we have - oh good that is not a problem then oh it's sort of a problem oh okay well figure that out later though okay this was one oversight there's no convenient spot to route the front panel audio and front USB here I also have to go in from over here yeah that was my favorite spot and you can take that route out so now that I've got my cable under the shroud I can go ahead and bring this up and plug into my front panel USB - connector there these have to be the thickest wires that I have ever seen on an AIO CPU cooler how the F much current are they planning to draw through this thing you bastard get on there I don't think I have ever seen a USB plug that has that block on it like all the all the housings have that cut out for the block but I've never seen anyone actually use it yeah come to think of it so where do we want these RGB strips ah everywhere oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah for sure for sure there but okay so here's the USB problem we've got our front USB 3.1 which is here we've got our front USB 3.0 which is here and we have two front USB 2.0 which are here the problem is that this place in a Seuss's attempt to go as fully featured as possible has four USB 3.0 s and that 3.1 powered type C there so they include an adapter so you can use a 2.0 plug off the motherboard for these 3.0 ports but we don't have any left because of all of our RGB stuff now for extra credit what we could do is we could take these two connectors and combine them to fit onto a single header do that is it worth the extra credit we got to go all the way oh so these are really simple to work with all you got to do is pop up this little plastic tab here at the back of the pin and then loop pull the pin out I wish the ATX connector was this easy to work with so now what we do is check this out so in the pin block here from the RGB controller so we're taking the ones from the cooler and putting them in there you can see there's empty ones because no one bothers to actually some do but very few people bother to put just the four wires in like a single width block so all we got to do is just put them in in the same order neat huh so now those two devices only take up a single USB 2 header ow ah damn that hurt what would you hate it when you drive a pin under your fingernails Oh mm-hmm yep oh crap what everything I just did was totally unnecessary there's a right-angle USB 3.0 port here so there was enough for the front panel stuff and for those both to be there well now we have one more I'm bleeding I held it stabbed me right under there yeah I don't know where the RGB headers are supposed to be okay so here is your RGB synchronization header nice then check this out we've got a couple of SATA power so there's a lot of power for this case that's kind of hilarious and then for the two USB 3.0 they've got one that's right angle and one that's straight to account for that a Seuss's motherboards often have one straight in one right angle sick oh wow that's amazing the system works Oh so between the air cooler this friggin thing our RGB controller and whatever this last thing is we have a total of three SATA connectors and one molex connector before we have actually plugged in any drives or peripherals why do they need to make it molex I don't know so this is kind of cool actually they've got this like cable management haider thingamajig in here and it can actually slide depending on how wide your motherboard is so that allows us to hide things like this USB 3.1 cable behind this cool little shroud here so here's our USB 3.0 connector here which on a normal system is one of the kind of eyesores because it's so bulky but you can't even see the cabling at all you just see the connector going in at the back so this one too this goes nice and snug at the bottom just like that wow that actually really is really clean yeah I like it power supply for Anthony so we're throwing in our 4 or 1200 watt platinum which appears to be the entire reason that there's a window built into the bottom of the case because this power supply has a display on it now I don't always keep the most glamorous parts of the build for myself but when I do it's dual 28 ET is an SLI this is gonna be the ultimate minecraft computer like that moment when you feel like your graphics card needs to have an RGB controller and a fan controller on it so this case does have that feature that allows you to put one of your graphics cards and kind of this like show-off position over here but I will not be taking advantage of it because with hard SLI bridges being what they are it's not possible to set up SLI with one of the graphics cards in the show-off position and one of them installed behind it you're gonna pop this out yes future I mean maybe someone made like a thing oh you've got to be kidding me did you find that in the manual how did you know that I just saw it and I was like HM that looks like a vertical bracket I wonder where that goes that's actually pretty smart I come bearing an assortment of PCI Express riser cables and a one and A two and E yeah yeah what yeah all right so I'm putting in my second graphics card here now I have a bit of a problem this extension is not the right angle kind so it's gonna be hard to get it down low enough and it might not work anymore once we do that so we're hoping for the best there we go nice okay now I wouldn't ship the system like this no but I also wouldn't ship a system with heavy GPUs like this installed in it anyway so all right cool speaking of which these both have 2a pins yep good okay all right so power me up Scotty it is a power yeah so sorry right or left unless your left oh okay that's yeah to be clear this probably would have been easier if we had taken the shroud off but we always like a challenge around here sure let's go with that kind of feel like I'm artificially inseminating a horse oh wait I can see it I can see it through the window that's easy we're done boom okay nice Wow I can't get my arm out Oh are we there we're almost there wow these are not that easy to plug in wish I had done them beforehand like I always advise people to do in my build guides and then forget about every time I'm actually building a computer mm-hmm sweet that is so clean hey that's not bad actually yeah that's not the best I've ever done but it's decent it's all in one place I need you to plug this in what is that that's the RGB control for the power supply all right horse doctor time I don't see it at all okay let's let's just let's look at the manual let's calm down no shroud taking the shroud office for the week Oh Oh hold on no I don't think I was over far enough oh okay whoa all right we're getting close laying out our peripherals there we go all right can I scoot past you here scooch away oh we need a monitor we do dang it hey soos has thoughtfully provided one for us though this is my second-favorite monitor from a soos right now it's are 144 Hertz 4k g-sync display I'm more of an ultra-wide guy though so I actually like the 200 Hertz ultra wide ah my finger can you tilt the screen down towards the bottom of the base thank you oh I love pivot monitors got that RGB life now that is cool being able to see a real-time readout of how much power your supplies drawing yep I was expecting more rainbow birth okay wish me luck everybody all right it's prompting us for if we want to enhance the system performance with the XMP settings oh yeah sure on multi-core enhancement turn everything on this is an ROG machine what the hey let's good luck everybody and it's running at 60fps no it goes really nicely with this build my stealth water bottle LTTE store calm subtle stealthy okay I'm on a pair of gpu-z yeah see what gpu-z has to say about this okay so one card is at 8x that's what we expect yeah the other card also 8x nice okay yeah anything's fine we can close up the panels and now what we got to do is get our sink running is there a peel on here there is a peel I leave two peels two peels it must be somebody's birthday dang it I suck boo boo me boo hiss even worse I sucked Wow okay so this is it the all ROG PC is done let's go ahead and do just a quick Cinebench r15 run see how things are going how's our overclock doing well we didn't really overclock it well no just the XMP all core turbo blah blah blah yeah a strip and we can see our wattage 265 ish and we're sitting at around four point seven gigahertz just shy of that yeah that's respectable not bad Cinebench score of just just shy of 2,000 that's actually pretty good isn't it yeah 1996 decent year that's good yeah all right this is one of my favorite things to do on an HDR enabled wonder shadow the Tomb Raider in HDR looks so good can you do HDR and 120 Hertz at the same time I believe so yes looks like it's completely locked at 120 at 4k I know right there's not a lot of systems that can do shadow of the Tomb Raider at 4k Ultra details except I turned motion blur off and just not even begin to break us way what's the power splitting 712 watts alright I was worried we weren't gonna be able to do the quake to RTX demo but it turns out it's a 25 second download so we're back in business ladies and gentlemen that's what a gigabit connection will do for you yeah hi hi baby it is amazing how even with these low-res textures and stuff better lighting changes how the game looks in such a big way you know what's kind of funny about this is like turning our TX on in a game like this is kind of like built-in nostalgia glasses the lag time between like shooting and especially the fact that there's a projectile is really disorienting in today's world it was disorienting back then - so we're at 4k HDR with our T axon and we're running it like 60 FPS yeah with the LS s on - so if we had d LS that's off it would actually be even worse that's freaking crazy how many of these guys do you have to take out all of them I guess that's like assumably the objective of war so there you have it guys everything is running flawlessly this is it you may not like it but this is what peak performance looks like but you probably like it cuz this thing looks freakin sick I think Isis has done an excellent job of tying together certain components in particular like the motherboard and the case especially and making them go together in a way that I don't know if I've actually seen before like especially those USB headers really cool stuff what else is really cool is of course Intel gamer days so if you check out the link in the video description you'll find deals on PC components laptops and desktops as well as some really cool giveaways which we will also have linked in the video description so thanks for watching guys subscribe and all that good stuff see you next time you're just playing games now aren't you",22:21

That reminds me of like um...listening to the Dollop there's episode threeeee..twenty-three Ummm It's about the race to Paris from New York done in 1908. It is one of the funniest things I've ever listened to. I recommend listening to it. I'll provide a link in the description to it but this part in particular is so damn funny and I don't know why. [Man's voice #1]: He ate a two-inch-thick steak while people stood around and watched and asked him questions. [Man's voice #2]: So this bogs down into a freak show. [Man's voice #3]: Wellll, *laughs* when not racing, you're just kind of road-tripping so why not eat a great steak? [Man's voice #2]: Is Roberts the driver of the flier?

Because you know what was the most trending topic of that moment because everybody made a video joking about that one topic. 'Course it's not that bad anyway, so thank you everybody so much for watching! I lost as is usual. But then again, I try to go until I lose, no matter what happens.

hQAHSlTtcmY,Web Dev Simplified,Tech,Learn React In 30 Minutes,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQAHSlTtcmY,2 years ago,586K views,Tech,hello everyone in today's video I'm going to be covering all of the basics of react so you know exactly what you need to know in order to get started building projects with react so let's get started now now before we get started I do want to say in this video I cannot cover everything there is to know about react I can cover all of the basics and teach you everything you need to know in order to get started with react but some of the advanced concepts and some of the mindset shift that you need to take in order to program efficiently in react I cannot fit into this video but I do have an entire full course on react that covers all of those advanced topics I can't in this video and it also covers the mindset shift and the ability to think in components and write efficient react code so if you're interested in checking that out make sure to click the link in the description below in order to buy that course so with that out of the way let's jump into this tutorial to get started I have Visual Studio code open to a completely blank project and the first thing we need to do is actually create our react application and to do that you need to be inside of a folder that has no capital letters and no spaces in the name our folder is called learn react in X minutes with dashes in the name instead of spaces so this was going to work for us just fine and what we need to do is we need to make sure we have note installed by just typing no dash B and if you see a version then that means you have note installed if you don't see any version where you see an error that means you do not have note installed and I have a video on how to install note linked up in the cards in the description below so you can check that out in order to figure out how to download note now once we have note downloaded we need to run is npx which is a lot like NPM but instead of downloading something it is actually going to run that command for you and we want to run the command create react app with a period at the end essentially that period says use the folder were already in to create the application inside of and when we hit enter what this is going to do is it's going to start up and create our entire react application it takes quite a while to download everything so I'm going to come back to you when it's finished downloading so now that that's finished downloading everything you can see that you have a ton of new files and folders on the left side here and if we scroll up our terminal you'll see that we have a bunch of commands we can use inside of our application and the main ones you want to worry about is NPM start which is going to allow us to start up our development environment and then NPM run build this is going to build our application minify all of our files and give us a production version of our application that we can deploy to a server somewhere and actually access on the internet so NPM start for development and p.m. run build for production that's essentially all you need to know also we can take a look over at the files that we have over here node modules dissolve our libraries and our public folder we have essentially our HTML file and what's special about this HTML file is it only has one div which is our route there's no style sheets there's no script tags nothing is inside of here except for this single div which is route and all of our application is going to be put inside of that route div react is going to generate our HTML and put it inside of this div here so our HTML is very basic for this application really the main meat and potatoes of the app is in the source folder where we have all of our style sheets JavaScript test files logos literally everything in your application that is part of your source files is going to be inside of this source folder and the main ones I want to look at is our index GS which is where our application starts and what this is doing is it's saying react down render which is saying render the content we pass in here at a certain element so you can see we're getting the root element which is that element inside of our HTML and we're rendering everything inside of our app component inside of that root element and if we go into our app component you can see it's rendering just this basic boilerplate code that comes when you create a react application so let's actually start up our application by running NPM start to see what it looks like and this takes a little bit but it's going to open up on our browser for us now with that loaded up you can see our application over on the right-hand side and if we change something for example if we change this instead of saying learn react if we say learn react today and save it's going to automatically refresh over here for us which is a really great aspect of react but for our use case we want to actually remove all of this boilerplate code we're just gonna return null here and if we save this you should see now nothing is showing up on the side over here also we can remove this extra code for the CSS and logo import as well as removing this test file all of these CSS files the logo file and also inside of here we no longer need this service worker code this CSS file or this Service Worker import here we can also remove this service worker down here now if we save that you can see we're back to our blank application and we just removed a bunch of the extra stuff that we're not going to be using in this application and when you're starting with a react app the first place you're going to start is your app component because this is the root of your entire application and for our application what we're going to be doing is building a really simple to-do list application I know to-do lists are not the most interesting thing to build but they are so good at showing all of the things that you need to learn with react and a really concise and short manner so to get started the first thing that I want to do is actually write the HTML for our application and we're going to start inside of our app component and return some HTML inside of here and a trick you can do is to use parentheses in order to return everything inside of those parentheses and we then we can actually go on to a new line which allows us to just format our code a little bit nicer so it's just a quick tip there for you and the first thing we want to do is we want to return our to-do list so our list of two do's and this is actually going to be a separate component so we're gonna create a component called to-do list and we're gonna return that here as the first element inside of our application and this isn't normal HTML as you can see this is not valid HTML but it is in JSX which is kind of like Reax version of HTML and it allows you to embed components inside of other components you can see on our index here we have our app component being embedded and inside of here we have a to-do list component so we can just create that by saying new file we can call it to-do list Jas and I have a plug-in installed on visual studio code if I scroll down here it's called es 7 react Redux graph kill iraq native snippets and what this allows me to do is actually just type in RFC and hit enter and it will create a function component for us inside of react and it will give it the name to-do list which is the name of our file now instead of here we can import that to-do list component and we want to import it from dot slash to-do list so this is giving our component from inside of here and we can just say hello world for example inside of our return and if we save that and we save our app over here you see a hello world is showing up because in our app were rendering to-do lists and in to-do list were rendering the text hello world so now inside of our app the next thing we want to do is put the input for adding the new to do so we can just put an input and we want to make it a type of text here and let's just close that off and if we save we're immediately going to get an error and that's because we can't put two HTML elements or JSX elements in this case next to each other inside of a return because this return can only return one thing any JavaScript function can only return one thing and right now we're returning two things a to do list and an input so what we can do is wrap this inside of an empty element this empty element is called a fragment and it allows us to return one thing which is this fragment which contains two things which is actually what we want to return now we have that to-do list text as well as this input here next up I just want to add a couple buttons this first button is going to be for adding art to do and then we want a second button what you're going to be for clearing art to do so we'll just say clear completed to do's and then lastly after this we're just gonna put a div which says how many to do is we have left to do we're just going to say zero left to do now if we save that you see we have our ad to do button are clear completed to do's and zero left to do and let's just shrink down this name a little bit so that we can get it to fit all in one line just like that and that's really all the HTML for our app component all the HTML for each one of our two do's is going to go inside of our to-do list component but before we can get started into that first we need to set up the state for our application because the way react works is it manages State inside of your application and when that state changes it rear Enders things for us and we want to store all of our to do's inside of a state so we actually render those to Deus and every time we change it to do add it to do deleted to do it'll actually rerender our entire component tree for us so in order to use State in a function component we need to use what's called the use state hook so we can import this from react like this inside these curly braces and now we can call the use state function and we want to pass it our default state for our to deuce the default is going to be an empty array so the first time our app loads we're going to use an empty array of two dues because obviously we have no two dues and now we need to set this to a variable here so we can say Const and the interesting thing about use state is it actually returns an array so we can destructor that array and then set it equal to use state and the first element is all of our two dues and the second element is going to be a function that allows us to update art to dues and this is a little bit confusing to look at essentially this is just object D structuring so if you don't know object D structuring make sure you check out my video that I have done on object D structuring it's linked in the cards and description below but essentially this first variable here to dues is every single one of the two dues inside of our to do state and the second variable is the function we call to update those two dues to show you a little bit of an example of what this would look like with actual data let's just pass in some default data we can just say to do one and we can have in here to do two as well so now we have two two dues by default inside of our application and we can pass these to our to-do list by just saying two dues is going to be equal to dues and this is what's called props essentially all of our components like app or like to-do lists are going to have props that we can pass to them and we pass them just like we pass attributes to an HTML element so we're saying that we have a prop to dues on our to-do list and we want to pass the taboos variable to that problem to dues we could have these as different names this could be called to-do lists for example and it would be exactly the same we would just have a to-do list prop on our to-do over here so instead of here this would say to-do list in our case we're just going to call it to dues because I think it's easier to work with so let's make sure we change also back to to Deus and now inside of our to-do list we can actually render out those two dews so for now let's just say to do is dot length and we need to put this inside of curly brackets here and that says that this is going to be JavaScript code now if we save that you can see it prints out too because we have to - duze in this list but obviously just printing out the number of - duze we have is not that useful we actually want to print out each one of our - duze and we can do that really easily inside of a loop and what we want to do is actually map over our current array and return elements of our actual - duze and we're going to do this with a to do component so let's create that to do component and of course we want to do that RFC trick in order to generate all the boilerplate code and inside of here we're just gonna pass in a to do element just like this now we can just save that go back into our to-do list and we want to import to do from dot slash to do just like that now we actually have our to do element inside of here to do component and what we can do is inside of an array we can actually loop over this so we can say - duze dot map and we want to do is we want to map over all of our - duze so for each one of our - duze we want to return a to-do element but to do component and we want to pass it art to do just like this and then inside of our to do what we can do is we can just say here we want to print out the to do just like that let's save both of these and you can see immediately we have to do one being printed and to do two being printed but there's actually a slight bug here if we inspect this we're gonna notice in our side of our console that were actually getting an error it says warning each child in a list should have a unique key prop and without saying is that this list of two dues reacted doesn't know how to update these properly every time our to do is array changes it's going to re-render every single to do in that list but we only want it to re-render the ones that change so what we can do is we can set a key here in our case it has to be a unique element so we can just set it to our to-do name which is right now unique anytime that you have a key you just need to make sure that it's unique for the array that you're actually using with in our case the name is going to be unique now if we save that and go over and inspect we no longer have that error as you can see so that's perfect and essentially what this key does is it allows react to only rerender or change the components that actually change inside of our array instead of rear entering all of them every single time it's really there for efficiency purposes now obviously we can't just store the name of our to do we actually need to store an object of whether or not it's complete we need to have an ID as well as a name so back inside of our app let's actually change this array to be an object we're gonna have an ID of one we're gonna have a name which is just going to say to do one and then lastly we're just gonna have a property call to complete which we'll just set here to false for now so now we have it to do with an ID a name and a complete flag and then instead of our to-do list we can just use to do not ID here as our key since that's going to be unique and instead of our to do we want to just print the name so we can say to do dot name now you can see to do one is showing up perfectly fine but obviously we don't want to just have the name being printed out we actually want to check box to check whether it's complete or not so let's set up all of our code for doing this first we're going to have a label and inside of this label we're gonna put the de tube name just like this make sure I get rid of that and then inside of here we also need our input which is going to be a type of check box just like that and we also want to set in here a checked property essentially the value now we want to set that to to do dot complete and now as you can see we ever to do with our check box over here and if we come over and change our complete value to true you can see it's going to check our check box for us and if we have it as false obviously it's not going to be checked now what we need to do is actually set up events so that we can actually add to dues so let's remove this default to do for now and just have an empty array because by default we're not going to have any to dues at all in our application when it starts up what we do want to add to dues whenever we add this to do with the add to do button so we need to set up an onclicklistener on our add to do button so we can just say on click we want to set this equal to a function in our case we're gonna call a function which is just called handle add to do and let's create that function up here we can just say function handle add to do and it's going to take that event property and inside of this function what we need to do is we need to set our - duze - one more to do so we need to take our previous two dues add our new to do and then set our two dues to that to do list but you'll notice one problem immediately we don't have access to the name inside of this field we can type this in and click Add to do it's going to call this function but we need access to this name and this is where it what's called the user Red Hook comes in handy so we can say use ref and the user effect allows us to reference elements inside of our HTML in our case the input so we can say ref here is going to be equal to a variable we're just going to call this to-do name ref and then we can create this variable up here by just saying it comes to do name ref is equal to user ref now we're going to have access to this input element inside this to do name ref variable and to access it we just say to do name ref current which is going to be whatever element we are currently referencing in our case this input so we can say current value and this is going to be the value of our input so we can just say that the name is going to be equal to this and then we of course want to return if our name is equal to an empty string essentially if they don't type in a name we just want to return so we don't add an empty to do and then afterwards for now let's just log out that name to make sure that this is working just like that so now let's inspect this page go over to our console and if we type in a name for example we just say hi click Add to do you can see it prints out hi if we type in just H it adds to do it's going to print out H so we have access to whatever is inside of this variable here instead of our input one other thing that we probably want to do is we want to take our to do name ref dot current now we want to set the value here equal to null that way if we type in something and hit add to do it's going to clear out our input for us it's just a nice quality of life change now the real change that we need to make is actually setting our two dues the way said to do's works is you have two different ways you can set them you can just pass it a value for example empty array would clear all of our two dues or you can use the previous value in our case our previous two dues is a function call so it's a function that is going to give us the previous two dues which allows us to change that so we could say that now our new two deuce is going to be equal to previous two dues and we want to spread this over our array and then we want to add a new to do to that list so let's just for our case give it an ID of one a name which is going to be equal to our name variable and a complete of false now what we can do is when we save this we type something into it add - do you see it's going to add that to do but the problem is we are always adding with an ID of one and if we inspect our page we should see that we have an error inside of our console which is saying that we have two keys with the exact same ID so what we need to do is actually download a library that's going to allow us to completely create random IDs and the best library for this is called the UUID so we can just say npm i UUID just like that it's going to download the library for us and we can actually import the UUID inside of our application so we can say UUID v4 from and we want to import that from UUID slash v4 just like that this is going to give us access to UUID v4 which is just a function that generates a random ID so now if we save that create some - duze we're no longer gonna get that error of having duplicate keys because our IDs are now completely unique but you will notice a problem every time we refresh our page we no longer have our to do is being shown up they're not being persisted across page reload and this is something that's very easy to fix with react we want to store these inside of local storage and the easiest way to do things which are a side-effect so for example every time we added to do we want to save it we can use what's called use effect which is just another hook inside of react and this is just a function which is going to take as its first parameter another function and this is the function that we want to do things so every single time something changes we want to call this very first function and the way we determine when to call that function as we pass an array of properties here and this array is going to be all of our dependencies so anytime anything in this array changes we want to run this use effect function so in our case anytime our array of today's changes we want to save our to dues and saving them is really easy if we're just going to save them to still local storage so we can say local storage dot set item we need to give this item a key here so let's create a variable for that we're gonna call it local storage key and we're just going to set that to dues to do app dot two dues just like that you can call this key whatever you want it really doesn't matter so we pass it first the key and then we want to make sure we pass it a string so we're gonna stringify whoops stringify our two dues so this is just a JSON string of our to-do application there we go so now we added to do add another to do it's actually saving these to our local storage but of course when we refresh they're not showing up and that's because we need to use another effect and this effect we're going to call to load our two dues and we only want to call this once right when our component loads so if we pass an empty array of dependencies it'll call this function once and since the empty array never changes it'll never recall this use effect and this use effect we want to set our two dues to what we get back from our stored two dues so we can say Const stored two dues is going to be equal to local storage dot get item of that local storage key and we want to make sure that we get that item stored into our store to dues and then we want to set our to dues to that store to dues only if we actually have stored two dues so if we have stored two dues then set our two dues to those store two dues now if I save that you'll see we're getting an error and that's because this is a string we need to parse this using JSON so we can just say json dot parse of that string this will convert it to an array and now if we say that you can see that this is working properly now let's add some to dues will say FFF a a and if we refresh those two dues are still showing up inside of our so we know that both storing and getting their to dues is working properly so now we have saving built into our application and only just a few lines of code which is the real power of the use effect inside of react now this is all great but right now we have no way to toggle or to deuce even if we click on this check box it's not actually going to check our to do for us we need to write some react code in order to store the change of our to-do from being not a complete to complete or vice-versa so let's write a function to do that we can just come down here create a function called toggle to do and this is going to take just an ID of the to do that we want to toggle and then what we want to do is we want to toggle the to do from our list so the first thing we want to do is get a new list of - dues we're just going to call this new - dues and it's just going to be equal to a copy of our current - dues list this is just so we don't change our current to-do list and we always want to make sure we create a copy in react you should never directly modify a state variable you should always create a copy before modifying it and then use that copy to set the new state so we've created our copy now we want to get the to do that ever actually trying to modify so we can get that from our new - dues by just finding a to do that has the to do dot ID which is equal to the ID that we passed in to toggle to do then we can just say to do that complete is going to be equal to the opposite of to do complete so we can just negate that here and then we can set our - dues to our new - dues this is essentially going to allow us to toggle or to do from complete to incomplete or from incomplete to complete but we don't have any way we can use that function because as you remember our - dues are stored inside this to do component which is referenced instead of our to-do list which is referenced inside of our app so we need to pass this function down into our to-do list so we can just say to do toggle to do is going to be equal to toggle to do then instead of our list we can import that toggle to do prop and pass it down to individual - dues just like this so now we're passing both the to do and the toggle to do function and then finally inside of our to do we have toggle to do function and on our input we can come in here and we want to say on change we want to call a function and this function is not going to be our toggle to do because we need to make sure we pass an ID so we're just going to say we're going to call this handle to do click and then we're going to create that function which is handle to do click and inside of this function all we need to do is we need to call toggle to do and we want to pass that our to do ID now if we save that and we just click the check you can see it's actually checking our box for us same thing with our a and if we refresh you see it's storing that complete status inside of our to do is inside of local storage and the way that this is working is a little bit confusing is what's happening is every time we click is calling this on change which is calling our toggle to do function with the idea of the to do we're inside of that intern gets passed up through to do list into our app which calls this toggle to do function here which resets our to do list variable to the new list of to do's with the to do checked that we clicked on now that we actually know how to toggle a none toggle our to dues let's make this text down here actually tell us how many to do is are unchecked and this is fairly straightforward to do we can just say to dues dot filter and we want to filter all of the ones that are not checked so we can say to do which is not to complete just like this and we just want to get the length of the not complete to dues now if we say that you can see we have one to do left we check this it goes down to zero we uncheck both of them it says to left to do and so on and if we add a new to do it's going to go up to 3 which is great now let's set up the click event listener for our clear complete we can just come in on click we want to handle clear to dues and we can create that function let's just do it right here and what this is going to do is it's going to set our to dues to the new list that doesn't have any of our complete ones so again let's create a variable called new to dues and that's going to be equal to our current to dues dot filter and we want to filter on all the tattoos that are not to complete so we can say to do dot complete this is going to be all of our non complete to deuce and we just want to set our two dues to that new two dues just like this and now if we click clear completed you can see it's clear everything that we have checked just like that and we refresh its going to save those changes and that's everything for the basics of react but as I mentioned there's so much more to react and my full course is going to explore everything in react in much more depth than I can in this video so if that interests you make sure to check out the course linked

Washington's butt was sufficiently kicked (not licked), winter was here, his troops' morale was low, some just up and left. Washington needed to do something; anything, to restore faith in the revolution. The British had spread throughout New Jersey and settled in for a winter of drinking cider and partying hard. Nobody expected an attack in the winter, so Washington started making plans for an attack in the winter. (Of course he did, He's George Washington.) The British had hired a large force of Hessian mercenaries from the German states of Hesse-Kassel and Hesse-Hanau to fight the rebels. It was these mercenaries that were stationed across the Delaware River from Washington and his army. And there were more Hessian reinforcements incoming, but they made an unscheduled stop because their commander got thirsty. No, not that kind of thirsty, that kind of thirsty. ;) It was Christmas Eve with a blizzard outside when Washington heard the Hessian defenses were down and he decided to attack. (Again, it's George Washington.) He made a perilous crossing of the icy Delaware River with 2,400 men and marched nine miles to Trenton, where he caught the Hessian forces completely off-guard. After a short, but fierce battle the Hessian surrendered in droves. It was a much-needed victory that sent a clear message, not only to the British, but to Americans across the colonies; the war was far from lost. General Cornwallis led the British forces South to counter-attack the Americans, but in a series of battles, Washington's defensive positioning and flanking maneuvers defeated the British three times in ten days, (There's a taste of 'Murica for you.) and the British decided to abandon Southern New Jersey for the rest of the winter. Washington finally set up a winter camp in Morristown, but for the Americans, there was much less partying than the British. Elsewhere, the British had taken Newport, Rhode Island because it was a good naval base. In the South, they failed to take Charleston, South Carolina, which left British loyalists unsupported and vulnerable to more harassment, and even mass expulsion. Congress sent Benjamin Franklin to France on a mission to convince them to join the war. And while the French generally loved any opportunity to hoodwink the Brits, they didn't want to join unless it was a sure win. (That coward) So, for now, Franklin spent his days chilling out and chasing tail. (Really, Ben?) The British Parliament couldn't believe the war wasn't over yet, and the pressure was on to end it. So the British came up with a plan; General Burgoyne in Montréal and General William Howe in New York would advance through the Hudson Valley and meet in the middle, splitting the colonies in two, and thus screwing over the American communication lines. Burgoyne began his movement South and after taking Fort Ticonderoga quite easily, he then came across heavy American resistance. So he sent Howe a dingle-dongle, asking if he'd be showing up anytime soon. Meanwhile, Howe completely abandoned the plan and gone for all-out personal glory by capturing the American capital, Philadelphia. He defeated Washington and his army at Brandywine Creek by using the old hit-him-with-a-decoy-and-flank-him-from-behind tactic, and Philadelphia was now in British hands, forcing Congress to escape to York. (Oof rekt) But Burgoyne was left on his own to face the ever-increasing American force in Saratoga. American General Horatio Gates teamed up with our old friend Benedict Arnold to deal one final blow to Burgoyne's army. Arnold wanted to take the fight to the British, but Gates wanted to wait for the British to come to them. After a heated debate, Gates, the senior officer, told Arnold to go to his room, but Arnold defied his orders and at the Battle of Bemis Heights, he charged at the British, and obliterated them. Great job, Horatio! By the way, what happened to that other guy who was in Saratoga? Who? Benedict Arnold. Never heard of him. Ouch. (So sad, Alexa play Despacito) Hey, George. Didn't I do a great job? Taking Philadelphia and all? Hmm? Didn't I- You're fired. (lol) Both Burgoyne and Howe returned to Great Britain, leaving British General Henry Clinton to take charge of the war. And the war was about to take a nasty turn, because with the victory at Saratoga, the French were finally ready to join the Americans. Alright Benny, we're in. Hey, isn't this kind of funny? You know, 'cause you're a republic trying to overthrow an absolute monarchy, and I'm an absolute monarchy helping you? Like, like could you imagine if your revolution inspired my people to revolt against me? And then they imprison me and all my family? And they chopped all of our heads off? (lol shut up) Could you imagine? That's called foreshadowing! For now, in America, winter was here once again, which meant yet more disease, more starvation, and even a little mutiny. After losing Philadelphia, Washington's job was again on the line. But suddenly, a Prussian guy with a very fancy name, hired by Benjamin Franklin, showed up out of nowhere and said, ""Hey, I'm here to give your man a European military training."" And train them, he did! They learned how to shoot accurately, how to march in formation, where to poop and where not to, and strict punishments were handed out to any who didn't comply. Washington's army came out of the winter in 1778 a new and improved force, ready to take Philadelphia back from the British. In the end though, they didn't have to. With the French entry into the war, the British ordered General Clinton to evacuate Philadelphia, and consolidate all of the British forces in New York. So Washington sent Benedict Arnold to reoccupy and secure the city, as he pursued the British through New Jersey on land, eventually finding a good opportunity to attack at Monmouth Courthouse. The battle took place on a sweltering hot summer's day, and as many soldiers died from heatstroke as they did from battle. In the end, after some incompetent/borderline treason from Washington's second-in-command, it was a draw, and in this war a draw is kind of a victory for the Americans. Next up, let's talk about this guy. This is John Paul Jones. John Paul Jones is handsome, Scottish, and absolutely insane. When the war first broke out, everyone was like, ""How do the colonies expect to stand up to the might of the British Navy with their meager fleet of converted merchantme-"" Yep, try telling that to John Paul Jones. This guy sailed to the British Isles, somehow captured a British ship off the coast of Ireland, and brought it back to France. Then he returned, attacking more ships, raiding towns, and evading capture the entire time. These are basically pirate tactics, but hey, if it works, it works. In one incident, he captured a British ship and returned to a Dutch port without an official ensign, because his was lost during the battle. That's a big no-no, and can have you arrested as a pirate. The Dutch helped him out by quickly creating a design based on Benjamin Franklin's description of what the American flag should look like, and they entered it into their records as an official U.S. flag. What they came up with looks pretty cool! The whole campaign probably played heavily on British morale, and brought into question their ability to win the war. And, Fun Fact, he was so cool that one of the towns he raided in 1778 gave him an official honorary pardon in 1999. Keep rippin' in heaven, John Paul Jones. You're an angel now. What the Continental Navy was lacking resources, though, the French entry into the war made up for. The French began with naval skirmishes in the English Channel, and they sent a large fleet to America, although it sustained a lot of damage in a storm off Rhode Island. The Americans were hoping for a bigger commitment from the French, so John Adams went to France to help Benjamin Franklin continue negotiations. Oh good. You're finally here. Check this out. Hey ladies. I'd like to fight you like a kite, cuz you're electrifying! Isn't this great? Is this... Is this what you've been doing? Yeah, why? We were sent here on a diplomatic mission to secure military support from France, not to philander with the locals. Wait, no, ladies come back! Ugh... Worst. Wingman. Ever. But the Americans would get some more help; the Dutch provided aid, although they never formed an official alliance. More significantly though, the Spanish, who had already been providing aid officially joined the war in June 1779. They would provide support in the Midwest and the Gulf Coast, campaigns that heavily impacted the Native American tribes in those areas. Both sides actually enlisted the help of Native American tribes throughout the war, sometimes even pitting those tribes against each other. In the summer of 1779, after a series of raids against the Americans by the Iroquois, Washington organized an expedition that burned down more than 40 villages, forcing the tribes to relocate to Canada for British protection. And another group that shouldn't go unmentioned were African Americans, both free and enslaved. They joined both sides of the war, hoping to gain their freedom, but afterwards, many were simply returned to slavery, particularly those who had fought for the Americans. Despite owning slaves himself, Jefferson had written a condemnation of slavery in the Declaration of Independence, but out of fear of offending the southern colonies, this was removed from the final draft. For the same reason, the American Army stopped enlisting African American men in 1775, a policy that Washington, a slave owner himself, supported. But they were forced to reverse the policy after the British promised freedom to any slaves who joined them. In general, you stood a better chance of gaining freedom if you fought for the British. However, even those that left with the British after the war suffered mistreatment and discrimination in their new lives outside of America. Our good friend Benedict Arnold is now in charge of Philadelphia, having a good time, partying down with, and even marrying a member of the Philadelphia elite, the same elite that had partied down with the British when they controlled the city, and suddenly the people of Philadelphia, including the state governor, started accusing Arnold of having pro-British sentiments. To keep the people happy, Washington wrote a letter rebuking Arnold, calling his conduct imprudent and improper, and that was too many ouchies for Benedict Arnold to handle. He asked Washington to put him in charge of the fort at West Point, then he contacted the British, offering to hand the plans of the fort over to them and join their side. Our good friend Benedict Arnold is our good friend no more. Luckily, the treasonous plans were discovered on a captured British officer, but Arnold managed to escape before he was arrested. As a British Brigadier General, he would go on to lead raids against American cities, most notably his rate of Richmond, Virginia in 1781. His betrayal shook George Washington, who had once again set up camp at Morristown. His leadership somehow held the Continental Army together through the harshest winter of the war. We're entering 1780, and Parliament was hopping mad that the war still wasn't over. The British debt was soaring, and despite taking parts of Massachusetts in late 1779, the North was in a stalemate. So the British decided to make a major shift in strategy to the South, an economically rich area with a higher level of support for the British. Or so the British thought. A year earlier, they had captured the under-defended city of Savannah, Georgia easily, and a joint American French counter-siege failed. Now, they laid siege to Charleston, South Carolina. It fell within months, with thousands of American troops surrendering to the British, a costly defeat. The British quickly moved to take control, and they sent stereotypical Hollywood villain with a British accent Bannister ""the Butcher"" Tarleton into the back country, where he hunted down rebels and destroyed them with ruthless brutality. The British presence also inspired local loyalist militias in the back country to rise up against their persecutors. The British really seemed to be onto something with their new strategy, and the ball was very much in Washington's court. I'm gonna send my most loyal general, Nathanael Greene, to the south to stop the British. Gonna have to overrule you there, George. We're sending Hero of Saratoga and your biggest rival, Horatio Gates. Watch this, George. I'm gonna save the day again, everybody will love me, and I'm gonna get your job. Here I go! And he got into one battle with Cornwallis, got annihilated, and ran away. Alrighty. Let's go with your guy. Nathaniel Greene knew the British outnumbered his own forces, and wouldn't be defeated with conventional tactics. So he had to think outside the box. He split his army into two, said ""Hey, Big Boy, look at me!"" and then they went running in two different directions Cornwallis sent Tarleton after Morgan, and he caught up with him at Cowpens, where Morgan proceeded to kick Tarleton's butt. Then the two led Cornwallis on a wild chase through North Carolina, his bigger and better equipped army, much heavier and slower than Greene's quick and mobile troops. Greene led Cornwallis further and further from his supply line, then crossed the Dan River into Virginia, picked up some reinforcements, and turned back to face the now exhausted British. At the Battle of Guilford Courthouse, the two sides engaged in vicious close combat. Cornwallis, fearing loss, fired his big guns into the chaotic fighting, cutting down many of his own men. Greene retreated, giving Cornwallis the victory, but Cornwallis lost a quarter of his men in the fighting, so it felt much more like a British defeat. At this point, both sides desperately needed something to happen soon to end the fighting. The British were running out of money, while the Americans were again facing mutinies, as the men went without pay or even basic living needs. Fortunately, the French were now showing up in greater numbers and were ready to fight. After his encounter with Greene, Cornwallis decided the only way to win the South was to first prevent the Southern Continental Army from using Virginia as a supply base. So he abandoned the Carolina's, moving to Wilmington, and on to Yorktown, a position the British believed would be easy to supply and support. On his march to Yorktown, he raided many farms, stealing horses and supplies from the locals, but also freeing thousands of slaves, many of whom joined him. The French saw Cornwallis' new position as an opportunity to land a decisive blow on the British. Washington wanted to attack Clinton in New York, but the French said it was a really dumb idea, and, to be fair, it was. Instead, Washington sent out fake dispatches to make it look like they would attack Clinton, but secretly their combined force marched all the way down to Virginia. A large French fleet under the command of Compte de Grasse arrived and successfully cleared the British Navy out of the Chesapeake Bay. The combined land and naval forces then laid siege to Cornwallis' army in Yorktown. The American and French forces tightened in around the city, raining artillery down on Cornwallis, who desperately appealed to Clinton for aid, but Clinton was unusually chilled out about the whole thing. Cornwallis held out for nearly a month before he had no choice but to surrender. Over 7,000 British troops were captured, a crushing defeat, and with that, Parliament had reached the end of its rope. The war just wasn't worth it, and it needed to end now. The British still held New York, Charleston, and Savannah, but fighting between the two sides mostly ceased as peace negotiations opened up in Paris. The resulting treaty in 1783 saw Great Britain remove its troops from American soil, recognize U.S. independence, and cede territory up to the Mississippi River. In return, the Americans agreed to pay any debt still owed to Britain, and gave fair treatment to any colonists who remained loyal to the Crown. The Spanish got Florida, while the French got an economic crisis that led to its own revolution a decade later. (Best reward ever.) Washington retired to his home in Mount Vernon, wishing his men farewell by saying, ""I most devoutly wish that your latter days may be as prosperous and happy as your former ones have been glorious and honorable."" He hoped to live out the rest of his days in peace, but unfortunately for him, a number of people wanted him to be the first leader of the new country. And by a number of people, I mean literally everyone. The first election campaign in American history was basically a grassroots effort to convince Washington to accept the office. He was sworn in on April 30th, 1789, and he himself established many of the standards and limitations of what the American leaders should be. First of all, there was debate on what he should be called. Is he a king? Is he our glorious leader? In the end, they went for a word that, at the time, was pretty modest; president. Like the president of your local bowling club, or office bake sale committee. He set up a cabinet of expert advisors knowing that no president could know everything, no matter how much of a stable genius they claimed to be. He proposed major legislation to Congress, and gave an annual State of the Union address to keep his own power in check. He stated that the U.S. should remain neutral in foreign conflicts, and in the end he voluntarily gave up his power after just two terms. He could have made the presidency anything he wanted, but his careful and cautious actions helped set the precedent of an office that is powerful in its limitations, decisive through its diplomacy, and respected in its humility. And so the United States was born, and everything was perfect. It had no problems. Not a single one. Certainly nothing that would, I don't know, cause such an extreme divide that it would lead to a civil war. Anyway, moving on. Quick quiz! Name the most American thing you can think of. Baseball? Bald Eagles? (Orange dude that wants to build a giant wall?) Calling the winner of an America-only sports tournament World Champions? (Sounds right.) Or maybe math and science? Wait. Math and science? That's right. If you didn't know, science is American as combining chicken with waffles. And don't just take my word for it, ask Thomas Jefferson! Of course, to do that, you would need a time machine, and that would take some math and a lot of science.

3heSgyr8_cs,FoodTribe,Food,James May tries your sandwich suggestions,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3heSgyr8_cs,3 months ago,544K views,Food,hello viewers and welcome back to the redesigned bug out bunker kitchen complete with my new fridge do not suggest your sets we've reversed everything is actually much better this way around and i don't know why we didn't do it originally anyway moving on some weeks ago we had a video showing rachel and lucy making me what was supposedly my ultimate sandwich yes lucy's was better it's just fantastic it's unbelievable but what it did do was generate some quite interesting comments which gave us a bit of an idea now to start with i'm going to read out to you this comment which came from someone who calls himself nick dutch mind body spirit psychic and tarot two weeks ago and he said now try dairy-free cheese gluten-free bread raw spinach steamed orange bell pepper and slices of tomato with a sprinkle of cajun seasoning and we thought why not invite other viewers to send in their sandwich ideas so you don't have to keep watching us eating stuff that me and tom used to eat in the 1970s so we've come up with a new series and we're calling it tribers sandoz we have to hope that we have all these things dairy-free cheese gluten-free bread bread would be down here yes look at that there is a fresh packet of gluten-free bread that was a stroke of luck dairy-free cheese that's a bit of an ass let's see if we've got any in the new fridge what were the chances of that vitalite dairy-free delightfully creamy slices of raw spinach surely we won't have any raw spinach yes we do right now we put it there steamed orange bell pepper orange specifically no yes there you are already opened in fact they're not strictly bell peppers but that is an orange pepper slices of tomato yes we've got some tomatoes for that let's have one of those and a sprinkle of cajun seasoning that's where we're going to fall down because we've never done anything with cajuns no look at that maggie peppery and warming cajun seasoning right so um i know i thought of a problem because nick dutch mind body spirit psychic and tara two weeks ago is clearly a he must be a vegan dairy-free cheese gluten-free bread so he might be see there because well raw spinach steamed orange boneless i can't legitimately use lurpak spreadable butter invented in 1901 can i because that is not vegan but i'm not a vegan not normally anyway so what do we think shall we make this with lerpax spreadable butter but it is if you want to make this nick dutch mind body spit whatever he is his way use a vegetarian spread olive oil spread or don't use any spread at all we're going to use lurpak which was in case i hadn't mentioned it invented in 1901 two pieces of gluten-free bread and we need a knife that will be in the drawer no it won't yes it will no it won't yes it will very much lurpak spreadable butter on one slice only did you speed this bit up this is a steamed orange bell pepper so let's put the kettle on uh oh actually this one is quite quick isn't it yes you're quite right with the old uh student two ring tragic bed sit device this would take several hours turn it on boil water let's see how we do while that's happening dice up a tomato which requires a knife which is in here there's one that i sharpened earlier i believe yes i did but i'm going to do it again very quickly over there because i can slices oh tomato do we want the nub endy bit of the tomato no okay so what are you writing three four slices put the tomatoes on first since they are there believe what do we think of that can you see that is this interesting yes no don't care i'm going to try that see if that's a flavoursome tomato not particularly pata let's do this the what's his name way jeremy pang sorry i'm talking about my mouth but he's featured in our other videos there we go been slightly too far away and who's broken this i don't i'm not full of hope for this sandwich what do other people think it doesn't come across as a fun sandwich not like say peanut butter and marmalade or chocolate spread and sugar but who knows that's coming up to the ball dairy-free cheese i'm going to open it this bit where it says peel i'm also going to try a little bit of this would you like to try a bit of this lucy brown because it is cheese and yet it isn't it smells nice it smells like um well yeah it smells like cheese it smells it smells a bit like sort of low rent burger cheese you want to try a bit a tiny corner lucy's hand comes into shot takes an insignificant amount of cheese we'll just give that a bit of a slice down the middle this is looking very promising there goes my water there goes my bell peppers to be steamed we're almost there anybody want a nub end of tomato ben don't like waste around here put slightly too much water in the pan and they are actually boiling but what the hell i've put it onto the heat milk setting which will be slightly low now they're steaming perfect spinach so i suppose when he says raw spinach we can just sprinkle a few leaves on i don't know i've never made a sandwich like this obviously so i'm not sure if it makes any difference which order clips go in like comment subscribe and we're going to sprinkle it with cajun seasoning so i would suggest i think i'll put the dairy-free cheese on next thusly as richard hammond would say give those maybe another 15 seconds or so but i think i'm going to put the spinach on next and then we will anoint it with as a word i use far too much with the steamed orange bell not bell peppers and then we've got the spring cleaners who's actually looking the colors are extremely good lovely colors quite um quite sort of pre-raphaelite in a way tom would you say it looks like a berne jones or something like that you know one of those nymphs in the pool type pictures or an italian flag indeed these you can't smell them that's one of the problems with food programs you can't smell things you can't taste things or you can look at them and that's the least important bit of the process but anyway i can assure you that these steamed bell peppers smell very peppery nice so let's just put those over that bowl for a moment so any moisture comes off how old is this lucy sure there's a bag in a bag oh i see it's not a bag of stuff it's a cooking bag it says they're in very small es but i didn't know that that's something new so there is is the is the cajun spices cooking but that may be useful one day we'll put it in this drawer and then when we're all dead someone can say what they put that in there and throw it away yes there it is yes smell want to smell nice isn't it cajun seasoning is a great thing used in say cajun food i suspect the reason it's in this sandwich is because it's otherwise rather terrible but in the same way that oyster sauce saves anything that you thought might taste a little bit chinese and soy sauce can save your dreary attempt a japanese tempura even though you're not really supposed to put it on there i don't think uh cajun spices will save a multitude of other things including probably this sando here we go what do we call a sprinkle um absolutely not too much because it's it's just going to taste of cajun what do you think so it's quite it's quite potent enough to save this otherwise very dreary sandwich here we go nick dutch mind body etc press it down because that's traditional on food tribe who is going to try this viewers tribes sando ben you have been volunteered tom is there anything in that sandwich that you don't like there's no peanut butter in it no this is there you go tom are you up for it um yes the enthusiasm in this room is it's overwhelming okay dive in just you know if that little bit of bell pepper was empty to go by that's going to be quite good i think it could probably do with a bit of soy sauce as well but [Music] i've been swayed i did not have good expectations i'm impatient that's good [Music] nick dutch etc etc etc two weeks ago i think you might be onto something that is surprisingly it's light it's fresh it's definitely flavoursome and it's not because of the cajun spices if anything i'd now say i didn't put enough of that on it could have had another quarter of a teaspoon tom right the cheese looks really disappointing though doesn't it cheese doesn't look right a salt and vinegar crisp looks fairly disappointing it's just a sort of crinkly beige vague circle it's all right it's all right i'd go further than that i'd say it's pretty nice it's pretty nice but it's a bit like if you're a bit late to a buffet you'll always find these sandwiches the only things left so you're hungry you're desperately tried i think it's not as bad as it could have been so i'm pleasantly surprised but i'm not overwhelmed by it okay but we've discharged our duty in making this video we will return with more tribes sandoz in the near future we will cut the cameras and make some hot dogs yep [Music] you,10:40
ifTF3ags0XI,Fireship,Tech,25 VS Code Productivity Tips and Speed Hacks,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifTF3ags0XI,7 months ago,770K views,Tech,visual studio code is like a knife it's only as good as the hands that wield it but unfortunately it has more knobs than a fighter jet and requires the steady hand of a surgeon to the untrained eye vs code is just a simple text editor like microsoft word with code highlighting but in reality it contains a ton of productivity boosting features that you're probably not using yet in today's video we'll compare amateur vs code techniques to the ones used by professionals allowing you to write and analyze your code faster because the most valuable thing you own in this world is your time if you're new here like and subscribe then leave your best vs code pro tip in the comments i'll choose one of them to win this free t-shirt next week and now let's jump right into things by installing vs code once installed you'll want to open up a directory with some files in it maybe you just generated a new astro project from the command line then to open it in your editor you pull up the file explorer and click open with vs code that works but it would have been much quicker had you done it from the command line if you're in the terminal and want to open a directory or edit a file you can do that quickly with the vs code cli using the code command but keep in mind if you're on mac or linux you need to first add the binary to your path now that we have the editor opened it's tempting to go around two different windows with the mouse and click on buttons to run commands just like we would with any other software but here's a little productivity secret the less you rely on the mouse the better vs code allows you to use the mouse for everything making the tool approachable but that's really the most efficient way to get things done you don't have to go crazy and learn something like vim or emax but it's important to understand that anything you do with your mouse can likely be done quicker with the keyboard virtually every command you see in the vs code window can be done with a keyboard shortcut you don't need to memorize them all but knowing about 10 to 20 will literally change your life letting go of the mouse may not feel natural at first but mastering the keyboard is a lot like learning to play an instrument it takes a lot of practice but eventually it becomes second nature the first shortcut you'll want to memorize is control papa which brings up the command palette the beauty of the command palette is that it gives you all the power of vs code from the keyboard without having to memorize a bunch of key bindings by default it will give you a list of recently opened files in addition you can start typing a file name to find it in your project and that's obviously much quicker than trying to find a file by clicking through a bunch of directories in the file explorer but the command palette can do a lot more if you type a right angle bracket it will give you access to virtually any command that you can run in vs code along with the commands for the extensions that you use for example you may want to toggle the minimap or one thing that you'll notice in some of my videos is that i execute javascript directly in the file itself and that's made possible by an extension called quoca which is a tool that i can start and stop in any file via the command palette the extension itself is really cool it automatically runs your javascript code in the background then appends the output directly in your editor which can facilitate rapid prototyping when your goal is to just write some plain javascript code now another really awesome thing we can do here is find pieces of code or symbols throughout our project when working in a really big file it's easy to get lost the worst thing you can do is scroll around the page looking for the function or interface that you need you could do control foxtrot to find that text on the page but an even better approach is to use the at symbol from the command palette that'll list out every symbol in the code so you can quickly navigate to it and if you want you can bypass the command palette altogether by entering ctrl shift period to do the same thing directly in the file itself now in other cases you may want to find a symbol throughout the entire project including all of your dependencies like node modules use a hashtag followed by the name of the symbol you're looking for to find that interface in your own code or your dependencies code another really awesome bonus tip here is that if you have a really long class name you don't even have to type the whole thing out just the first character in each camel cased word and it will work just as well the command palette is awesome but it doesn't really help you write your code faster when you see a line of code that you want to edit the natural approach is to take the mouse and then highlight that line a developer might do this hundreds if not thousands of times per day a faster way to get to where you need to go is to hit control golf followed by the line number that you want to focus on from there use the arrow keys to go character by character and hold down the shift key if you want to highlight something or use ctrl arrow to move word by word when your cursor lands on a word that you want to edit hit ctrl delta to highlight it so you can then delete it or replace it but here's where things get really mind blowing if those characters appear multiple times in the code and you want to edit them all at the same time just hit ctrl d again and again and you're now a 3x developer editing three lines of code at the same time in some cases you may want to use the mouse for multi-line editing holding down alt while you click on different parts of the editor will set up cursors in multiple places that can be really useful for writing repetitive css properties one place you might use this often is with opening and closing html tags but you can actually make your life even easier by installing the auto rename tag extension this will automatically rename the closing tag when you edit the opening tag and it can work in other languages beyond just html now in other cases you may just want to delete or move a line the amateur approach is to highlight that line do a right click with the mouse and find cut then do another right click with the mouse and find paste here's the faster approach if your cursor is already on a line all you have to do is hit ctrl x to cut it no highlighting is necessary but if your goal is to move the line somewhere else then there's an even better approach use alt followed by the up or down arrows to move the line somewhere else quickly and if you want to copy that line as you move it use alt shift followed by the arrows now one other thing that you likely often do in your code is comment it out to disable it the worst possible thing you can do is go line by line adding the comment syntax to each line if this is how you currently do comments you'll want to pay attention to this next shortcut first highlight the code using your mouse or by using the control l command to highlight line by line once highlighted use ctrl forward slash to toggle comments on that code now when speaking of code comments it's often important to format them properly in javascript that typically means following the js docs standard and there's an extension called add js.com once installed it allows us to highlight a function then use the command palette to add a comment to it automatically bonus tip in your js dot comments you can use the link tag to link to other symbols in your source code when you hover over that symbol it will give you the comment that if you click the link it will take you to that part of the code automatically that makes writing comments much easier but what if we could also make them easier to read by also installing the better comment extension we'll get automatic highlighting in our comment text any line that starts with a bang is now red and all of our to-do's are highlighted orange but now let's switch gears into a very important topic the terminal you can open a new terminal session directly in vs code in your current working directory using control backtick when you start a new terminal it uses your default shell which in my case is bash if you click the caret you can use a different shell if needed like powershell or wsl what often happens though is you need multiple terminal sessions running at the same time like one for your test runner one for your dev server and so on to keep things organized click on the icon then change the name or the color of that session and now you don't have to fumble between different terminals to figure out what each one is doing now when you type out an actual command in the terminal and you screw it up you can use ctrl arrows to quickly navigate to a different part of the actual text because your mouse won't even work here but if you already hit enter and got an error message you can use ctrl k to clear out the terminal then use the up arrow to go to the last command in your history and just rerun it instantly but what if there is a way where you didn't have to write the same terminal command over and over again like how many times have you written npm run build or npm run test to simplify things you can create a vs code task which is just a json configuration that contains a command that you want to run in the terminal now instead of pulling up the terminal and writing out a command you can just use the command palette to run it automatically and it will show the name of that task in the terminal sidebar here speaking of the terminal one of the most common things you'll do here is execute commands for version control using get not only are git commands hard to remember but it can be very dangerous and painful when you mess them up the standard procedure for get ups is to go to stack overflow and look at the top questions there because they're almost all related to get the funny thing though is that i think this is an area where it actually makes more sense to use your mouse as opposed to the keyboard in the source control tab in vs code we get a breakdown of all the changes in our current working directory we can just point and click at files that we want to stage and also notice the icon next to each file which will tell us if that file has been modified added or removed now from the drop down menu we get a list of all the possible git commands most often we're just committing files but vs code will give us a breakdown of all the possible commands without having to look them up in the documentation if you're working on a big complex project with other developers i'd highly recommend installing the git lens extension it provides a bunch of extra ways to visualize and explore your code and most importantly it will tell you exactly who to blame when your code stops working it's a really great extension but now we're going to look at another extension that's brand new and even crazier normally when you want to work with a git repo on github you need to clone it to your local system but now thanks to the monopoly that microsoft has on the developer ecosystem this process can now be streamlined with remote repositories install the extension then click on this icon in the bottom left corner to open up a remote repository it'll have you log in with your github account then you can start contributing to any repo on github without needing to worry about complex git commands you can create a new branch edit some code and then submit a pull request without ever having to leave bs code in addition to remote repositories you should also know about remote ssh to connect to a remote server and also remote containers to use a docker container as your development environment instead of your local system these extensions are managed by microsoft and can turn your basic text editor into a full-blown integrated development environment but let's get back to our actual code in many projects you may find yourself writing the same boilerplate code over and over again if you find yourself doing that an easy way to improve your productivity is to create a custom snippet from the command palette run the configure user snippets command you can create global snippets to use across all of your projects or scope them to an individual workspace basically you just modify this json file with the code that you want to insert then when you go back to your main project you can use the insert snippet command to quickly add your own custom boilerplate but if you work with a popular framework there's a good chance that somebody already did this work for you before you go building your own check out the extensions panel to see if there are any pre-built snippets out there that already meet your needs oh and here's a cool random thing if you need to create a new file in the file explorer but it lives in a directory that doesn't exist yet you can create that file along with any nested directories on top of it automatically by just putting a slash in front of the file name and vs code will automatically create those directories now yet another awesome tool that i want to mention is the pace json as code extension if you work with typescript one extremely tedious thing you might have to do is take a json object and convert it to a bunch of types to represent some kind of schema this extension will take your json and automatically infer types using a tool called quick type and in some cases that can save you hours of work but the final thing i want to leave you with is a quote you've probably heard before there are only two hard things in computer science cash invalidation and naming things naming your code is hard which means that you'll often be renaming things when you name something poorly your first idea might be to do a find and replace across your whole project but that can be kind of dangerous a better idea is to find the thing you want to rename then if you right click it you can find all of its references or implementations then from there you can use the rename symbol option to safely rename it across all of your files i'm going to go ahead and wrap things up there but make sure to share your own vsco pro tips in the comments and if you want to support my work consider sponsoring me on github or

-nSHiHO6QJI,CNET,Informative,Google's congressional hearing highlights in 11 minutes,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nSHiHO6QJI,3 years ago,8M views,Informative,"Our only witness today is Mr. Sundar Pichai Pichai is the chief executive officer of Google. Chairman Goodlatte ranking women adler distinguished members of the committee Thank you for the opportunity to be here today More than 90% of all internet searches take place on Google or its subsidiary YouTube and they are curating what we see Google, has long faced criticism for manipulating search results to censor conservatives. Conservative individuals and organizations have had their pro Trump Content tagged as hate speech or had their content reduced in search results So what are you going to improve that situation? Congressman thanks for the question. If I may Some of the studies you mentioned we have investigated those there are there are other studies which have looked at it we have found issues with the methodology and the sample size and so on. But let me step back and say Providing users with high quality accurate and trusted information is sacrosanct to us It's what our principles are. And our business interests and natural long-term incentives are aligned with that We want to serve users everywhere and we need to earn their trust in doing so Ileana Murillo is Google's head of multicultural marketing. Does miss Murillo do good work? I'm not directly familiar with her work, but she's an employee of Google and you know We're proud of our employees. Your head of multicultural marketing Said you were pushing to get out the Latino vote paying for ride to the poll to the polls for the Latino vote Only in key states and you're saying that's not accurate Yes, that's right They be haven't found any evidence to substantiate you she just made it up out of thin air the day after the election I wrote This email to your top executives and it's not true Congressman. I'm happy to follow up, but I think the employees today do their own activities. We don't want to follow up I want the real answers right here in this committee As I said earlier, we've looked into it We didn't find you push to get out the key vote and and I would say the two most populous states for Latinos would be California and Texas Did you push to get out the Latino vote and pay for people to go to the poll in California in Texas? We as a company didn't have any effort to push out votes for any particular demographic that would be against our principles We participate in the civic process in a 
nonpartisan way and we think it's really important We do it that way. I I have an iPhone and If I move from here and go over there and sit with my Democrat friends, which will make them real nervous Does Google track my movement? Does Google, through this phone, know that I have moved here and moved over to the left? It's either yes or no not by default There may be a Google service which you've opted in to use. So Google knows that I am moving over there It's it's not a trick question. You know, you make a hundred million dollars a year You ought to be able to answer that question. Does Google know? Through this phone that I am moving over there and sitting next to  Mr. Johnson, which would make him real nervous It's his question. It's yes or nope. I wouldn't be able to answer that I'm looking at yes say yes or no without knowing more details sir. I have a concern Concerning China In 2010 Google left the Chinese market place due to concerns over Hacking attacks censorship and how the Chinese government was possibly gaining access to data I'm interested in what has changed since 2010 and how working with the Chinese government to censor results are part of Google's core values. Do you understand my question? Congressman We right now there are no plans for us to launch a search product in China we are in general always looking to see how best it's part of our core mission and our principles to Try hard to provide users with information we Always have evidence based on every country we have operated in Us reaching out and giving uses to more information has a very positive impact and and we feel that Calling. But right now there are no plans to launch in China The extent that we ever You know approach a decision like that I will be fully transparent; including with policymakers here and engage in consult widely so anticipating what took place in 2016 happening again, and and this is specifically regarding What Russia did to foment racial tensions in the United States and Wanting to know how you are responding to that. Were they called for, you know fake protests? Either to get African Americans to turn out to protest something that was fake or to have white supremists Be ginned up to attack communities of color so specifically what is Google doing to respond to that? We mainly saw with respect to Russia Limited improper activity on our ad platforms but in general, you know We are not a social networking company across the products. We do it's an area we haven't done well as a company so we typically are in connecting groups of people and that's not how Google mainly works today and So we haven't seen that kind of activities on our platforms, but we are vigilant and you know I'm happy to share any findings which come through as we look into it more the operating environment in China has Deteriorated with respect to surveillance censorship and the like since Google first made the decision in 2010 to leave So I want to ask very specifically are any employees currently having product meetings on this Chinese project and if not when did those end? We have undertaken an internal effort. But right now there are no plans to launch a search service in China as I said earlier Are there any current discussions with any member of the Chinese government on launching this app Currently we are not in discussions around launching a search product in China Are there any current discussions with members of the Chinese government about this? You know, this effort currently is an internal effort and you know, I'm happy to consult as well as be transparent to the action We take, as steps towards launching a product in China. And who at Google is leading the dragonfly effort It's, you know our efforts around Building search, you know, it's undertaken by our search teams, but these are distributed efforts It's a limited effort internally currently Will you Mr. Pichai, rule out launching a tool for surveillance and censorship in China while you are CEO of Google? congressman I commit to engaging one of the things which is important to us as a company. We have a stated mission of providing users with information and so we always think it's in our duty to explore possibilities to give users access to information and You know, I have that commitment. But you know, as I said earlier on this will be very thoughtful and We will engage widely as we make progress this is now the fourth hearing in a series of ridiculous hearings on a free speech of Internet companies a significant portion this hearing was a waste of time because the First Amendment protects private individuals' and corporations' free speech rights, so I'm gonna search for Consequence Steve King i'ma hit the news tab The first article that pops up is from ABC news It says Steve King's racist immigration talk prompts calls for congressional censure That's a negative article, but you don't have a group of people from Google sitting here thinking and trying to modify search results every time Steve King comes up, because a negative article appears. That's not what's happening, right? We always operate for any query with the same set of principles We are trying to reflect what is currently you know If it is newsworthy what is currently being discussed about that phrase Thank you So, let me just conclude here by stating the obvious If you want positive search results do positive things if you don't want negative search results Don't do negative things. And to some of my colleagues here across the aisle, If you're getting bad press articles and bad search results Don't blame Google or Facebook or Twitter consider blaming yourself Did Google design a prototype for a search engine that would be used in China to censor content Congressman we have undertaken an internal effort Did you create a prototype that there was a report in the intercept that says a prototype for the censored search Engine was designed We have developed and explored what a search could look like if it were to be launched in a country like China and that's what we Explored and how many months was that project ongoing? We've had the project underway for a while and there have been other projects which we've undertaken for a while and we've never launched them - so we could be a constantly exploring... How many how many people were working on it? The estimates, you know the number of engineers and the project have varied over time at ten at one point We've had over a hundred people working on it. It's my understanding. Who makes the judgment calls regarding content moderation at Google Chairman it depends on the area. So for example if it's YouTube we have You know very clear teams which are responsible for YouTube content policies and... They identified whether is it possible for the customer to write to them and say ""hey here's a concern I have"" ? We give clear channels for content creators to You know to raise concerns back and we have clear avenues and and we also have had people who are responsible for these platforms Including content moderation appear here You know and I think they've consulted widely here too - thank you. Well you've gone for about three and a half hours and it's about what we predicted isn't it yesterday when we talked so we Thank you very much for your participation today. This concludes today's hearing and without objection All members will have five legislative days to submit written Question for the witness or additional materials for the record and with that this hearing is adjourned",10:58

IKyaNyYS5Is,Hardware Canucks,Tech,INSANE Gaming on 65-inch 4K TV!!!,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKyaNyYS5Is,6 years ago,2.1M views,Tech,"this video is brought to you by NCIX.COM
great technology selection and service what living room gaming a full 5.5 inches tall
that this is 8 inch gaming oh yeah fifteen point six inches I didn't think
it had come down to this let me show you what real living of gaming is like gasps enough with an intro already just
do it how they see five inches why would you bleep me I said 65 hey hello
everyone I'm Dmitry with Hardware Canucks and my face after unboxing this giant
TV remained the same for the remainder of the time that I've spent with it the
goal was to see how something of this size in my tiny living room would work
as a daily driver for content but also explore all types of possibilities for
gaming so the first thing to cover with the samsung series 8 65-inch 4k Smart TV
is the physical tour and Here I am next to it for scale it's like a mini theater
in your living room and notice that it is a flat panel and if you want to check
out our experience with the curved 55 inch TV it will be linked in the
description below now I'm absolutely impressed with just how thin these
high-end TVs are net a little bit thicker closer to the center with this
thin edge effect the brushed aluminum frame at the front is beautiful that's
also curved around the bezel and is completely plain without any unwanted
stamps but a simple Samsung logo at the bottom Center without any ambient power
lights and that s UHD indication in the top right the TV stand also falls in
line with a beautiful simple design with that long front aluminum support that's
incredibly low profile and the base extends all the way back because the
front rail is more forward it kind of helps to sort of visually elevate the TV
so it doesn't look like it's right on the surface
now this suHD indication doesn't mean better resolution of UHD the native
resolution here is 3840 by 2160 with support at 60 Hertz the SUHD format is
Samsung's way to promote their higher-end models with this extra
marketing inclusion to say that 4k content looks more vibrant clear and
just processed better with their suHD TVs this is an LED backlit TV which
means black and white pixels won't compare to all a tee
but Samsung has done plenty to compensate for proper viewing experience
with UHD dimming that controls brightness and contrast in multiple
sections of the screen and viewing content with native color profile
delivered natural colors with perfect white balance and I can say that because
I made the video that I was watching so I know exactly what to look for in terms
of connectivity at the back the ports include a USB 3.0 which is perfect to
playback media off a USB storage below that is a one connect mini port that is
a super convenient way to connect to the hub so you don't need to handle any
connections behind the TV and just plug and play stuff off this hub furthermore
we have a LAN port if you prefer to choose that over smart built-in Wi-Fi
and finally components and video in Jacks with audio out four speakers back
to the one connect mini that is covered with brushed aluminum nice touch and
this hub is pretty small here is next to the 1 + 2 4 scale on the side we find a
pair of USB 2.0 ports and on the back or HDMI 2.0 that are all hdcp 2.2 compliant
then there is the optical audio and mini connect port for the TV but it was time
to start gaming on this thing and I hooked up the shield Android TV which is
capable of 4k video streaming and has got some pretty awesome titles running
off the shield itself like half-life 2 that was a pleasure to play through
although I'm no good with the controller but here the 1080p signal off the game
was up scaled with no artifacts that I could see and so for any console players
720p upscale signal will look fairly sharp from a couch distance but for
optimal detail 1080p or higher is of course recommended Talos principle just
came out on a shield and getting try that game up scaled look fantastic and
here the framerate wasn't so great an enabling game mode on the TV allows for
slightly smoother picture and it actually reduces import lag that is
otherwise felt but to experience true 4k gaming I had to pull out the big guns
my SLI gaming station that you can check out the review of in the description
below now want to find out how the TV would handle
itself in a PC environment and enabling game mode and jumping into gta5 the
world inside the game was truly beautiful at 4k resolution plus at 60
Hertz it helps to achieve good enough refresh rate for this game although I
still could feel a little bit of input lag from the controller so I won't be
playing any first-person shooters with this TV in my living room and I'm not
talking about any competitive shooters but the mouse aim is just not what I'm
used to however racing games on the size is fantastic letting me enjoy the
large-scale environment and the view from the cockpit like I'm right there
plus the slight input lag wasn't much of an issue here my gaming experience both
on the Nvidia shield and the PC were satisfactory for the refresh rate vivid
colors and rich contrast and watching native 4k YouTube content was absolutely
beautiful the anti-glare coating on my setting in
my tiny living room that is struggled to keep off the reflections and in a
brightly lit room the TV brightness was fine and reflections in the dark areas
of the screen were muted but still noticeable and so what I wanted to get
out of this experience is whether or not we are ready to start talking about 4k
gaming in the living room utilizing a multi-purpose smart TV like this one for
entertainment which i think is the future of livingroom gaming and while
very demanding still to drive games at 4k the upscale engines in these TVs is
really good with satisfying results and everything about this model indicates
sort of future proofing your investment in the way everything is handled from
the convenient mini Kinect hub the amazing in deformity of such a large
screen remote for ways to handle color presentation and the Smart Remote that
lets you interact with all the menus seamlessly plus the built-in Smart Hub
is there auto in my experience it comes out disappointing with just lack of
content and apps and so the way we're noticing these TVs to emerge with
multi-use is fantastic and I thoroughly enjoyed the series 8 model and I cannot
wait to try out the next Generation TVs so guys I hope you
enjoyed this video all the relevant content will be linked in the

fihVzPl7Dys,Dr. Becky,Science,Do ALIENS exist? | An astrophysicist's perspective,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fihVzPl7Dys,2 months ago,393K views,Science,when people find out i'm an astrophysicist they have one very big question for me do aliens exist it's possibly the biggest question that humanity is ever asked right like is there other life out there in the universe are we alone and while there's no scientific evidence yet anyway for life either in our solar system or beyond science can help us estimate a probability or a likelihood that life exists out there somewhere in the vastness of space all right so to answer this question scientifically we first of all have to put an estimate on the number of stars in the universe that have planets that can support life so where do you even start with that well why don't we start with just the number of stars in the universe first of all and then we'll get to how many of them actually might have planets and planets that can host life so stars are found clustered together in what we call galaxies they're essentially islands of stars out there in the universe our galaxy is the milky way galaxy in which the sun is just one star of a hundred billion of them so to work out an estimate for how many stars in total there are in the universe you can start by working out well how many galaxies are there in the universe how many islands of stars and we can do this using the hubble ultra deep field it's an image of a patch of sky that's less than five percent of the size of the full moon it was taken by the hubble space telescope which stared at the darkest patch of sky that we know is in a constellation called fornax in the southern hemisphere and it's there in it for about six months total and that was to collect as much light as possible from even the faintest furthest galaxies that might be in that region of sky this is what it found you can see in this image that there's six stars from our own milky way in the foreground kind of like getting in the way but everything else that you see in this image is a galaxy an island of billions of stars from this beautiful spiral galaxy here that looks like the milky way to this tiny pixel right that's so far away we can barely detect it at the last count in this image there's about 5 000 galaxies in this one tiny patch of sky this image is only 1 30th of a degree by 1 30th of a degree the entire sky is a circle it's 360 degrees round so this is a tiny tiny fraction it is in fact only 124 millionth of a fraction of the total area of the sky so if you take that 5 000 estimate of the number of galaxies in that tiny patch and extrapolate it across the entire sky then the number you get is that there are at least a hundred billion galaxies in the observable universe but remember the hubble ultra deep field is the darkest patch of sky we know that has the least amount of stuff in it therefore the least amount of stuff that's giving off light so a hundred billion is probably an underestimate because there's also galaxies that have smaller dwarf galaxies orbiting them as well like the large and small magellanic clouds little dwarf galaxies that orbit the milky way that you can see from the southern hemisphere so perhaps we should round up our number to at least a trillion galaxies in the universe just to be safe but then the question is well how many stars do each of those galaxies those islands of stars contain the milky way for example has around about 100 billion stars but its largest closest neighbor andromeda has a trillion stars there are also the smaller dwarf galaxies though and the huge elliptical galaxies of even more stars so let's assume that the milky way's 100 billion stars per galaxy is a nice sort of average amount of stars that you would get per galaxy then you say okay there's a trillion galaxies at least in the universe each of them contains on average about 100 billion stars you get the number of stars in the universe is somewhere around 100 sextillion stars that's a one with 23 zeros after it it's a big number one that's really quite difficult to actually imagine like even the analogy that people use with time to demonstrate you know the difference between a million and a billion like even doesn't help here so if you haven't heard this before a million seconds is 12 days a billion seconds is 31 years a trillion seconds is 31 000 years and a hundred sextillion seconds is 3 100 trillion years so it's an unfathomably large number despite its ridiculously largeness we at least still have a number now for an estimate on the number of stars in the universe the next question is how many of them host planets that can support life now we think the majority of stars probably do have planets around them it's sort of like a natural occurrence from the formation of the stars that you will end up with the leftovers the rubble going into making forming planets around them that's a fairly recent sort of understanding from the fact that we've just found so many planets around other stars in our milky way as well but will they support life are those planets that form actually habitable that's the bigger question now the first thing you need to get life is the ingredients for life things like carbon nitrogen oxygen the stuff that makes up you and me and proteins and amino acids and all this kind of stuff those elements are made in stars themselves unlike stars which are mostly made of hydrogen they turn that hydrogen into helium in nuclear fusion when they reach the end of their lives and go supernova is when they produce the heavier elements in nuclear fusion they're almost forced to as they try and resist the crush of gravity inwards it's why you hear people say like we're all made of stardust very poetically right is because all the elements that make us up like the only amounts that go into my hand right now they were all forged in a star that is now long dead and that the sun and the solar system formed from the remnants of so you only get planets that have the ingredients for life in regions where many generations of stars have come before for life to develop you then need time right the earth and the sun are about 4.5 billion years old and we think it took just less than about a billion years for the first signs of life on the earth to appear then took another four billion years or so for like life to fully evolve into intelligent life as as humans right so you need a really long time you need a star that's going to live at least a billion years for life to appear on that planet that rules out the most massive stars right they have to burn their fuel quicker to resist the crush of gravity and the most massive of them only live for a hundred thousand years or so so that rolls out a good chunk of our 100 sextillion stars that we reckon are in the universe and it also rules out the ones that are like first generation stars still like the ones first form out of like pure hydrogen we need like the third the fourth generation of stars that have formed from the leftovers of others to have the ingredients there that are gonna live the longest amount of time to give life enough time to develop of the stars we're then left with which do have planets those planets need to be in what's called the habitable zone or the goldilocks zone you know where it's like not too hot and not too cold to support life and that zone will actually move depending on how hot the star is so hotter stars are bigger and there's going to be much further out whereas if the star is smaller and cooler you can have the zone much further in you can have a planet actually orbiting quite close to its star where it would still be habitable whereas you know in the solar system for example mercury is far too close to sun to be habitable right it gets absolutely fried by radiation from the sun but the sun was much smaller and maybe mercury would be habitable because it would be cooler as well so actually getting a planet in that zone that reduces your probability even more than a star actually will have a planet that can host life so if we take a very conservative estimate for all of these numbers reducing our probability all the time that a star will have a planet that can host life and i actually go through all those numbers in chapter eight of my book as well if you're interested in picking that up but if you do that you get a probability of one in a quintillion stars having a planet with both the ingredients and the right conditions for life that's a one with 18 zeros after it but because our estimate of the number of stars in the universe is a hundred sextillion and that one in a quintillion of those supports life even if you take a really pessimistic view of things you still come to the conclusion that there are a hundred thousand planets out there in the vastness of space and the entire universe that could support life so to me as a scientist looking at all of the statistics and the probabilities like the question of do aliens exist is a no-brainer like yes of course they do space is so vast there are so many stars out there i think it's very very unlikely that we are indeed alone but these are planets probably in other galaxies entirely billions of light years distance travel and communication with them would be impossible under the laws of physics as we understand them if we're to think about life on habitable planets in our own milky way galaxy that would at least be a little bit closer to home we perhaps have to take a more optimistic view this is what frank drake did the famous astronomer when he came up with the drake equation to actually try and estimate not just the number of habitable planets but the number of planets with civilizations that were capable of communicating with others the kind of things that like sci-fi writers dream of and the equation looks fairly complicated there's lots of different terms but they're all ones that i've sort of spoken about in this video so far as well there's a huge uncertainty on all of those terms in that equation there's a huge range of different values that you can assume for each of those terms as well so there's a huge range of values that you can get using this equation for the number of active communicable civilizations in the universe right and it goes down from like the tiniest of fraction which would mean alone in the galaxy probably even alone in the universe up to 15 million actively communicating civilizations in the milky way alone but of course it's once again the scales that scupper us because the milky way is a hundred thousand light years across that means that it takes light traveling at the fastest speed there is the universal speed limit that einstein said that you cannot travel faster than at least as we understand the laws of physics right now anyway it takes like a hundred thousand years to get from one side to the other so if you were gonna send a radio signal which is light it would take a hundred thousand years to get to a planet on the other side not exactly a time scale that lends itself to having a conversation we're not even close to sending a probe and even a fraction of light speed the furthest thing we've ever sent from earth are the voyager probes which were launched in the late 70s they've only just left the solar system it will in fact take voyager 1 which is the furthest thing currently from earth and the sun 75 000 years before the sun is no longer its closest star so while i firmly believe that life must exist somewhere out there in the vastness of space just because the numbers don't lie i think the sheer scales involved are really going to scupper us when it comes to any form of interstellar travel or communication and i don't think we'll ever make contact with another intelligent alien civilization but i would be very happy indeed to be proven wrong before we get to the bloopers i just want a huge thank you to this week's video sponsor brilliant brilliant is a website and an app with a huge range of interactive courses on topics in science and maths that get you to learn by doing no you wouldn't be here on my channel if you didn't want to learn something new but maybe you want to take your understanding to the next level and personally i think brilliant is a great way to do just that especially because recently they've upped the interactivity on their courses making them so much more intuitive for example check out their logic course one of the skills you need as a scientist is critical thinking especially through mathematical reasoning right it's how you work through probabilistic answers to questions like do aliens exist in brilliance logic course you can learn how to solve problems by going through logical reasoning like i do every day working through questions in my research so if that sounds like fun to you maybe you're a budding scientist too then head to brilliant.org forward slash dr becky and sign up completely for free plus you'll get 20 off an annual premium subscription if you go to that link which is linked in the video description down below so a huge thank you to brilliant for sponsoring this video and now roll those bloopers oh it's so cold i get like so wrapped up today this forward it's only a thirtieth by a thirtieth of the fifth it's the death it's only a thirtieth by a thirteenth oh thirteenth why is this so hard to say i think this year's scales involved are really going to scupper us when it comes to like international track international travel it is covered that discover in international travel not the scale of the universe interstellar interstellar not international oh i feel like i need a giant plate of mashed potato to talk about aliens donuts [Music],14:02
n30DARxk9A4,TheStraightPipes,Automobile,2019 Lamborghini Urus Review - Is It A Real Lamborghini? Yes,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n30DARxk9A4,2 years ago,1.7M views,Automobile,I'm Jacob hearing bolster drive 20:19 lamborghini horas with launch control hit so whoever said this is a fake Lamborghini is wrong oh yeah you're all liars this is so fast and handles so well let's start with the horsepower of torque 641 horsepower 627 pound-feet of torque from a four liter twin turbo v8 so usually Lambos are naturally aspirated yes they are high revving naturally aspirated v10 s and V twelves so we've driven an Aventador and Aragon before yes we have the port for Monte so now we're in the Auris yes so this is obviously an SUV and this is Lamborghinis second SUV after the Rambo Lambo so I guess sports car companies now are making SUV so that they could sell them and maintain their company's kind of like Porsche did yeah and this is the world's first super sports utility vehicle as labeled by them yes but enough of our voices let's put this in Corsa and let's hear some of this exhaust huh it's so so good Krabbe hit him with the cliche here we go full send into cliche corner and this is unbelievable it feels like a car and I hate saying that but it actually does I think this is the most car feeling SUV yeah for sure it is this is the best SUV I've ever driven in terms of driving like no question nothing this is perfect I was going to say it's at the top of my list as well top of the list or number-one at the list well I think I enjoyed myself in the Alfa Romeo style' vealmoor however this is better and I would take this that's shocking but okay alright I love this I would take this no question if money was no object and I think I'm a little bit rattled by the non column-mounted panels really well the Alfa Romeo had it the levanta had it every Lamborghini has column-mounted paddles but in the SUV now we're on the steering wheel but we do like steering wheel-mounted paddles however they are always bigger on column-mounted so it is more enjoyable it's just more different for me and when I get a Lambo that's what I want is different before we keep going we want to know who's bought a car thanks to our car buying advice so send us a DM on Instagram at the straight pipes and at URI terracing let us know what car you bought because of our advice and we want to know because we get to drive more fun stuff like this back to the video so anyways this has a setup 8-speed Auto and it shifts like lightning fast my god this car so fast - movie sorry my favorite part about the transmission is that it knows exactly what you want to do I guess you kind of have to be in the right mode kind of but no matter what mode you're in it reacts very well oh it's always fast but I just leave this in Corsa because it's actually surprisingly not too stiff for an SUV it's definitely stiff but even in Corsa mode it's fine to drive in this like daily driving but in Corsa mode you lose a lot of your safety features which just has a whole ton of true and you can't even use your adaptive cruise when you're in Corsa because Corsa is race so let me explain these modes because they are in Italian so we use our anima thing over here which stands for adaptive Network intelligent manage so they made an acronym sound Italian yes so we put it in strata for street sport for sport Corsa for race sabbia for sand tariffs for Earth dirt kind of off-road mode and then FA for snow or Neve I'm not sure how to pronounce that sorry and then we also have ego but if you look really quickly it looks like eco but there's definitely no eco in this car so that's just your custom settings exactly so you have three different ways to adjust that and the way to switch the modes are super awesome you pull back on this lever like it's a friggin rocketship or something it is the coolest however what bothers me is I can't push it back forward so once I'm in course I don't wanna get back into strata I gotta click down like check this out for that's what I'm saying that's cool though it's fun I gotta get pumping shotguns pretty much to make your Lambo go faster or slower and then let's talk about that so we also have this shifter pad thing for reverse yeah so to start the car you need to lift like the rocket launch button press Start or you can stick your finger through which it never fits and then to get it in Drive you click the paddle to put it into first which kind of makes sense if you know other Lamborghinis because this is a Lamborghini yes and what other Lamborghini is also have is if I click both the paddles neutral and I can be a jerk into the rev all day it's the best and then I click the pedal and I'm back into third gear I absolutely love that feature that's one of the things that sucks about McLaren is that since the paddles are connected you can't just like pop into neutral yeah that's exactly it Yuri would you mind if I sent it into cliche again only if you try to get the back list okay so I'm gonna try and get the back loose and honestly I almost cannot get the back loose because this has all-wheel steering and it is all wheel drive and it handles incredibly well feel so friggin planted I'm pretty much convinced if you do leave traction in ESC sport which is in Corsa you can't get the back end to step out yeah you gotta like probably do some real tricks and I'd really get the momentum to make make a kick out for commercials exactly which I'm not gonna do today it takes corners so flat and the steering is so friggin direct like it's razor sharp the smallest movement on the string you is the biggest movement of the car and the car itself shouldn't move the way it does for an SUV I think the biggest way to notice it is if you drive a more regular SUV and then drive this the amount of input you give you're like oh I turn too tight that's exactly it so let's talk more about the shifter now ok the reverse you've got to pull the whole thing all the way back it's cool it's it's kind of intimidating there's like a lot of weird gimmicks to it but that's part of the best part of it yeah yeah Lamborghinis should have little weird quirks about them and this definitely does have quirks can't say course not much my ass duck it's fine and then quickly back to those paddles what do you think of the quality of them compared to other Lamborghinis or other maybe German cars yes so the paddles are definitely better than outies paddles which I'll get to in a bit they're not as good as other Lambos like the Huracan and the Aventador are they even metal I think they're metal i they feel kind of about the fact that I have to second-guess it I know kind of disappoints me but they don't feel that bad no there I just I know you mean I want those Alfa Romeo paddles these look cooler though cuz they're like I don't think sharps strongly disagrees oh these are so sharp they're like Lambo Chanel ones were like this big man so let's talk about looks because this is the first new style Lamborghini SUV and it is very controversial it is but it's also not at least not to me so what's not controversial to you the whole front end it looks like a Lambo to me how about the side the sides kind of weird because it's an SUV but it is very sharp it's got strong hexagonal shapes everywhere yeah exactly like they have design elements from every other Lamborghini in here but certain angles in certain colors it does look bad like from a side angle in it can look kind of muddy and just like what is that oh yeah as far as I'm concerned this should only be bought in yellow and people are comparing it to the Aztec and stuff which is pretty funny that is kind of funny just because the lines and the sharpness exactly so like there are weird parts but I do think it is a super good Lamborghini SUV much better than the first attempt from Porsche to make an SUV yeah so Porsche made the Cayenne first which ended up pretty much saving that whole company so we should get into that a little bit for this one yeah after we finished with the looks okay so let's start with the front end then we've pretty much got a stretched-out Aventador I guess yeah for sure we do and if you just look at the top half of it it looks like a Lambo and in the front end I think my favorite part is how you can get those kind of triangle sections to show up but that's an option right yes it is you don't have to get them painted and then behind that we've got some rads and stuff like that lots of vents for everything nothing fake really on here not on the front but there are some on the back we've got very Lambo headlights and then we've got that nice Lambo logo up front and we've even got a cool little radar buried in there and it doesn't stick out like a sore thumb and this does have night vision as well so now if we move to the side view amazing body lines like amazingly crisp and the way the window lines look in the side view it does look very coupie like a slant back kind of like the x6 and the new Porsche Cayenne coupe yeah I think this is my favorite looking of all of the coupe style SUVs which I really don't like and while I'm driving the driving position is solo I absolutely love it and then if I look to my side view mirror's I can actually see a little bit of shoulder from the backend yeah it doesn't it look so peaking with that like that helps a lot it does help and I really like these wheels Lambo nails their wheels and this is no exception what size are these these are 22s they look pretty big that's like only one inch bigger than my Prowler I think no it's definitely not you do that you do not have 21 inch wheels I'm pretty sure it's the one you don't have 21 inch wheels it's at least 20 I'm sorry to break that to you it's only check okay and what does the Continental recommend a tyre the Conti Sport contact six and then how about the back view back view is all right you know this is one of the few cars where the rear three-quarter angle is not my favorite angle yeah I agree but it like it looks good we got a little spoiler on the back we've got Lambo style taillights kind of like the Veloster and like only one all the way across and I love the taillights I wish I had like more kind of like the Veloster and ya know I love these taillights and then we got some fat exhaust and they sound incredible and I'm gonna let you listen to that once again so hard and the exhausts are very real yeah mm too real yeah yeah that's a compliment by the way and then we've got like a great diffuser at the back it's like it's pretty good but it doesn't say auras anywhere on the back no it doesn't I don't know if there's a badge delete option or whatever but I think just saying Lamborghinis and um I think people will know does the Huracan say Huracan no I know I invented or no no well it's a lamb just perform on tape well I guess this guidance isn't on the side on my favorite feature the sidestep the chrome flexible sidestep yeah that's the one feature we didn't talk about cuz we absolutely can't stand it it makes the car look so ugly yeah so definitely just don't option that because you don't have to have that but what's cool is we've got frameless windows on these doors yeah they look awesome when they're open and then when you open the door you get the thing where you don't get dirt on your pants because the door covers the rocker panel but it's kind of useless with the sidestep however if you open the doors at night you got nice Lambeau logos on the ground in the front and in the back so I guess that's pretty much it for a Lamborghini worst looks what color do you think yellow only right yeah absolutely this one's white which is actually pretty cool I absolutely hate the grey yeah the grey just doesn't do it for me at all but when the earth first came out I wasn't too sure on the looks but I follow Heather Lamborghini on Instagram helps her Lamborghini girl Heather Lamborghini girl and she's always spec'ing out the craziest worst ISM and pretty much everything yeah yeah you can get a full out yellow interior on yellow and yellow so I don't know give her a follow and like check out all the crazy specs that they make these in like I don't even understand how it's possible yeah yeah there's you can get this in the wildest spec and this is definitely far from this is Barry oh yeah also those sides of it together yeah now let's get you into the driver's seat but first I just want to talk about the actual exhaust the tone and the crackles that is ascended one more time okay so that's set f/8 speed up shifts chainsaw style which we absolutely love the actual tone of the so much better than the one in the Cayenne which this engine is based on the crackles and pops on this are so cool they just they're endless so if you keep tapping the throttle I'm just tap tap tap tap tap tap crackle crackle crackle it's the coolest sound it kind of sounds like a drumbeat it's just like Gumby drum beat drum beat like watch but I hope I'm into that in a Lamborghini you know what I mean I'm not into it I get it I want this to be a high-revving v10 as well but it is what it is and I like and that's why I think I like driving the Alfa Romeo a little more that exhaust sound compared to this yeah this is much deeper sound but anyways let's get you into the driver's seat so here's why I like the transmission so much put it into strata nice and quiet but if I floor it it'll still do what I wanted to do it's still ridiculously fast but the exhaust is minor yeah but the way everything kicks into gear so quickly it makes it perfect like if you needed to drive this around and regularly and then you floor it like you don't need to do like both switch the drive mode to make everything work like it just goes all the time yeah and if you were to do launch control this will do 0 to 100 km/h in 3.6 seconds which is pretty freakin fast and the more I look at this thing speeding around town the more it looks like kind of a big wagon to me more than an SUV ok like don't you know I get the feeling it's so low so wide it's almost just like a fat fat wagon I guess I guess but aren't all SUVs just fat wagons I mean an e63 wagon is a lot different than a GL cease well so you let me know yeah SUVs are fat wagons you go I'm ok with that I'll allow it it right after cliche corner I'll talk about the interior way too fast so inside we've got a pretty good infotainment it's pretty much right out of the Audi q8 but it's totally reskin to match everything else in the Lamborghini lineup yeah if you've ever driven an Audi you'll be right at home with this infotainment like you absolutely loved it in the a7 I love it in here so unlike a lot of luxury cars this doesn't have a scroll wheel to control everything this just has to touch screens which are very easy to use but they come stock with like a haptic feedback thing on so you got to go into the MMI settings turn that off so it's just click and works like a normal type screen and there's a theme with Lamborghinis where things are hexagons or octagons what is it it's hexagons and wise so we've got a lot of hexagon shapes all inside this infotainment everything's skin that way and it actually looks pretty good and it suits the rest of the car yeah it's unique to Lambo and it works in here so we've got apple carplay Android auto yeah it works flawlessly rewinding Satellite Radio's no tuned mix though we've got the built-in Google Maps tile navigation which looks really nice and on our lower screen we got our climate functions stuff like that and a little button for shortcuts I love it then up here on the left on the big screen we can actually shortcut stuff onto the left side - yeah we can have our Android auto auto car play right there and then we've also got a really good high-res 360 camera reverse camera all the parking sensors and stuff but I've got a little beef with the 360 camera so the stitching is kind of weird so we go from the front camera to the side camera it kind of moves around like this and changes the stitch around so we're trying to park to something close you can't get an accurate reading yeah I saw that I know what you mean but it doesn't bother me yeah to me it just it drives me crazy like there's other manufacturers who nail that stitch perfectly and this one just like I don't like how it moves I just love the resolution and I don't really care about anything else because of that then if we move to our gauge cluster this is probably my favorite part the graphic design for the gauges are so perfect so if we're in strata that was 25 clicks later five plates I did the mat so we've got a blue tack that goes through as we get faster and then if we click down to sport it turns orange which is really nice and then if we want to go really fast one more click to Corsa and the gauge completely changes and it looks exactly like the Huracan perform on Tate it is so super cool yeah I love it and these gauges when you switch gears the numbers come in with such a cool animation and there's like no lag in the entire system in none of the graphics nothing the lack of lag is my favorite and with that change you also get a head-up display change which makes it so easy to shift it's got it's hexagons again for like shifting patterns it's so clear so much better than that x3 MX for M we drove oh my god yeah yeah it's unreal this is perfect which to me is kind of shocking that's such an exotic company nails graphic design some heart usually you're like oh it's going to be super weird but I'm gonna take it because I want the fast car but this is the best of both worlds and then what I also like with the gauges is we can click on this left menu button we can get our lap times elapsed at sports displays or my favorite reduce display so I'm gonna click that it gets rid of everything all we have is our speed our TAC and our gear oh and then also in the head-up display when you're using all your lane keep assist and all that stuff which works really well just like the Audi's do it shows up very clearly in your head up display yeah it does like you said work very well and it's so intuitive so you mentioned outtie so Lamborghini is owned by Volkswagen group so this does share parts with the q8 the q7 the Bentley of Antigua and the Porsche Cayenne so it's actually sharing some parts with some pretty damn good cars so I guess they don't have like a skeleton crew in Italy making up a whole computer program even though they're car engineers you actually have car engineers making infotainment and everything that already worked perfect and like we mentioned earlier earlier on in the video Porsche Cayenne basically saved Porsche I think not the Lamborghini needs saving but this is just gonna let them build more sports cars more Aventador SV J's more Nurburgring lap times more more full press cars for us to drive in the future yeah exactly so there's nothing bad about the Auris anyone that's upset you're upset for the wrong reasons they're probably just upset cuz they can't afford one pretty much so let's quickly wrap up the rest of this interior we've got lots of great materials brushed aluminum Alcantara some gloss black which isn't the worse because it is such an expensive SUV there is a lot of gloss black but yes this is at the price point where you're not gonna clean it yourself we've got cool armrests that ratchet forward a really really nice comfortable steering wheel with the Lamborghini logo in the middle which is awesome and the Italian flag just does a little friendly reminder all the buttons everything we need is very easy to find lots of room in the back seats do you fit just fine I fit completely fine behind myself Headroom and legroom I was shocked we got a cool moonroof we've got a lot of room in the trunk we should probably do the box test box test five six seven eight and our newest guy nemesis Autosport 9 get your own box on patreon.com slashes straight pipes man the visor test oh yeah okay three two one oh haha wait a second super car pass is there a second one no I guess this is a super car we got to make a new super SUV and super truck test and and then it will fit a small ice cap just perfectly fine and this has kick to open in the trunk as well which is super nice and it's got cool privacy cover just like lots of room more room for an SUV than I thought it would have it's extremely practical it is a Lamborghini it has a Lamborghini badge but it's so practical they're just daily driving especially for a coupe SUV yeah exactly the seats are super comfortable we got these nice stitched in headrests which you obviously have to pay extra for and I guess that pretty much rounds off the interior I would actually look to talk about the Bang & Olufsen 3d audio system which is an option on this do you like it I love it and guess how much it cost because I had a look at the little options list eight thousand dollars Canadian pretty much bang on oh really yeah eight thousand three hundred and forty seven dollars crazy but it sounds so good so and you might as well just check that and the speakers come out of the dash yes they do one other thing behind the wheels which looks super cool are the massive carbon ceramic brakes 10 piston yeah they're huge they were like bigger than this steering with where you hit the brakes for me hard like ah that wasn't even full yeah I know I I kind of should have expected that okay but anyways they stop like crazy and carbon ceramics are actually standard on this which makes a lot of sense I guess I've heard Carbon ceramics aren't the best for actual racetrack driving yeah steel ones but I think for road driving just have fast brakes once in a while yeah pretty much they look cooler are you a little surprised that there's like no carbon fiber in here well you can option it the only carbon fiber I saw was on the gas cap oh yeah that's right and this does have air suspension so you can raise it crazy high so you can go off-roading go into the snow but it also dumps pretty low not as low as I would like it for air suspension yeah it could go a little bit lower maybe like a show mode or something exactly but it does lower automatically when you're driving at higher speeds as well so maybe if it just could be parked in that mode so is that it that is now it okay so let's get into the price two hundred and thirty two thousand dollars to start Canadian and this one is obviously not the base model so this one is two hundred and seventy seven thousand one hundred and fifty two dollars you know what that's worth it that's kind of cheap for a Lamborghini exactly it is honestly is and for the fastest coolest SUV I mean I guess maybe the Cullinan is more expensive but I don't think it's as fast and wild like for the fastest super SUV this is the only Super Sport SUV well I guess like the track Hawks there too but I think for the fastest one that's a fair price this is faster than a track Hawk but the track Hawk is like very very close in terms of speed and it's very very American and very very different yes everyone stares at this on the road I had a guy that pretty much almost crashed right in front of me I wish I had a dashcam he was trying to take a video of me behind him and then he ended up on the curb but anyways this gets a lot of attention that's the number one thing that people want when they buy this and you get it because as someone who's in the industry when I see it I'm like okay it's a Lambo SUV but like you don't feel that it's a Lambo SUV until you're behind the wheel personally yeah I kind of get that like you're like alright cool but then once you drive it oh yes the engine the sound the performance the steering wheel like everything the driving position or the little badges then like yes I'm in a Lambo this is a Lambo okay so other competition kind of I guess fastest UV is we've got the Range Rover SUV are was pretty wild as well it was but not as wild as this but maybe the exhaust was better yeah the exhaust was very different and unique then the Alfa Romeo stell vo was like not quite here but it was pretty awesome as well Mahler and slower that sounds better then we have the track hawk obviously and the Cayenne Turbo which we've also driven does the GL c63 s kind of compete with these as well yeah kind of but that feels more khari than this yeah it does and I guess it's just time for Ferrari and Aston Martin to come out with one as well I seem from prototypes or whatever on line yeah they're coming soon do you think they're gonna be better than this I don't know the Aston Martin I feel like it won't be but the Ferrari not sure oh and then the Levante oh yeah that's right I mean it's like Italian SUVs that are fasiq there's a lot of cool stuff going on with SUVs and I know you hate them I just don't like SUVs in general but I like this I think personally I like fast SUVs don't say it more than a dance no not fast too doors by the way you're a sedan guy yeah yeah I'm not a sedan guy not really I was so nervous that you're gonna say that you like the more like adventurers or Huracan like maybe the doors Wed up like okay like gullwing stuff like a Model X this should have doors ago up [Music] so let us know where the Lamborghini wrist falls in line with other fast SUVs and fast Italian SUV don't forget to subscribe hit the notification dollops that got pinched or undock on select straight fights and join our youtube membership and check out teespring

IDtHjIe13aU,The Grand Tour,"Automobile,Comedy",Jeremy Clarkson Drives An Incredibly Loud £1.8million Aston Martin Vulcan | The Grand Tour,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDtHjIe13aU,4 years ago,3.5M views,"Automobile,Comedy","Even at slow speeds,
it is quite loud in here, which is why I'm wearing
this silly face microphone so you can hear
what I'm on about. The noisiest part
of this car, however,
is not the engine. [ENGINE REVS] [SQUEALING] That's the brakes. [SQUEALING] They are quite...
They are quite squeaky. [BRAKES CONTINUE TO SQUEAL] It actually sounds like
I'm stamping on a piglet. And things get worse
when you put your foot down. [ENGINE REVS] I'm not going to say
that it's like being attacked
by a bear because it isn't. But it is like being
in a room with a bear that's thinking
of attacking you. At the moment I've turned the
engine down on this knob here to its minimum setting. It's only producing
500 horsepower. So it's not really
the speed that's scary. Oh, God! It's the noise
and the harshness and the vibrations. It's not a very well-equipped
car either. The windows don't wind down,
for instance. There are no toys at all. And you only get
half a steering wheel. However, there is
one amazing thing you get for
your £1.8 million. An all-expenses-paid trip to
a racetrack of your choice, where an Aston Martin
test driver will teach you
how to drive your car, not with the engine wound
down to 500 horsepower, but with it turned up... ...to the max. Holy cow! Ha-ha-ha! The engine is now
producing 820 horsepower. And the speed
just beggars belief. The bear is in attack mode. The figures say it'll do
0-60 in 2.9 seconds. And has a top speed of 208
with that wing on the back. But it feels a hell of a lot
faster than that. Oh, God! The other thing
you get for your money is a squadron of mechanics. But sadly... not a handbrake. Right, what I've done now
is I've taken... yes... I've taken the
steering wheel off, so I can't put it in gear
to stop it rolling away. Oh, God. Agh. Argh, argh... When I'd finally
got it to stop, the jacks were deployed and
the mechanics set to work. That's the thing
about the Vulcan. Wing angle, roll bar,
suspension, brakes. Everything can be adjusted
to suit your personal taste. After ten minutes
of pretending I knew
what they were doing, I was back on the track. And the car felt...
just as bonkers
as it had done before. However, I've changed. I've been driving
this thing now, I don't know,
three or four hours, and I'm starting to...
understand it. I'm starting to
get used to it. I'm starting to trust it. Now I'm starting
to understand... why the Vulcan can go round the Nardo handling circuit
in southern Italy nine seconds faster
than the McLaren P1. Nine seconds in car time,
that's a year!",4:54
L0rCE9fE6T4,The Infographics Show,Informative,The Most Infamous Serial Killer - Why Was He Never Found?,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0rCE9fE6T4,3 years ago,8.1M views,Informative,"Serial killers, while being some of the worst
humans in existence, never fail to intrigue and fascinate us. Some of the more famous of these include:
Ted Bundy, the educated maniac who murdered scores of young women in the 1970s; Jeffrey
Dahmer, aka The Milwaukee Cannibal, and John Wayne Gacy, without doubt the scariest clown
in human history. Over the pond in the UK they had doctor death,
Harold Shipman, who could be said to be the most prolific serial killer in modern times,
with a body count of around 250 people. Psycho Ed Gein didn’t kill many folks, yet
his hobby of making clothes and ornaments out of body parts inspired a lot of gruesome
horror movies. But today we are going to focus on one of
the most intriguing serial killers of all time, in this episode of the Infographics
Show, Why was Jack the Ripper never found? Don’t forget to subscribe and click the
bell button so that you can be part of our Notification Squad. We can’t start this show with an introduction
to who Jack the Ripper was, because no one knows. Along with the Zodiac Killer, Mr. Ripper has
become one of the biggest mysteries in the bloody world of serial homicides. But let’s have a look at what he did. Hid handy work, which included killing and
eviscerating women on the streets of London, scared the Brits witless in the late 19th
century. He did most of his work in the slums of East
London in the district of Whitechapel, which is why he was also called, ""the Whitechapel
Murderer.” Another name he was given was the “Leather
Apron”. He got the name of Jack the Ripper from a
letter he ostensibly wrote to police known as the “Dear Boss” letter. So, what did Jack do? Well, the story goes that in the 1880s, East
London was a place of absolute squalor. Immigrants from all over the world flooded
there for work, but that didn’t always work out for them. Crowded streets were festooned with what the
English might call habitual boozers, and women of ill-repute could be seen lingering on many
a street corner. People blamed the immigrants for high spikes
in crime and overcrowded streets. Racism was pervasive, as were fights and robberies. The police had their hands full as London
was on the brink of social unrest and rioting, but the police in 1888 got the shock of their
lives when a murderer came to life, and he wasn’t like any killer they’d ever seen. It’s thought that he could have killed 11
people, but police report that they can only say he definitely killed 5 people. These are known as the ""canonical five"", meaning
they were part of his killer canon. Now 11 bodies isn’t such a big deal when
you consider the Ted Bundy’s of the world, and while Bundy was a necrophile, the ripper
had arguably even stranger proclivities. He used a knife as you might guess from his
name, slashing throats and bodies, sometimes to ribbons. But he also mutilated women’s genitals,
made all kinds of incisions on their bodies, and skillfully removed their internal organs. This surgery might include removing the kidneys,
uterus, or generally any parts of the abdomen area. Sometimes he’d just hack away at the women’s
faces so they were unrecognizable. Now, because East London was such a crap-hole
in those days, police can’t be sure if lots of other murders at the time were his doing
or people were just copying him. Jack the Ripper was huge in the media, and
the frenzied, mostly-working-class public ate-up this wicked story with as much enthusiasm
as us modern folks might lap-up horror stories in the dubious tabloid, The Daily Mail. Police worked hard trying to find out who
was responsible for the heinous crimes, interviewing thousands of people and detaining over 80
of them. Rewards would be given for any advice on this
ripper, and so even regular people were out investigating this crime. East London was patrolled by cops 24/7 and
amateur sleuths were not far behind them. Police were focused on people with certain
occupations given that removing a uterus is not something most people can do. It’s said Jack was an expert with his blade,
and so cops looked at butchers, surgeons, doctors, physicians and generally anyone who
might cut up bodies for a living. As for the letters to police, quite a few
of them claimed to be written by the Ripper, but the most famous of those was the “From
Hell” letter. Police believed this letter was the only one
that was genuine. Postmarked, 15 October, 1888, it went like
this: “Mr Lusk,
Sor I send you half the Kidne I took from one
woman prasarved it for you tother piece I fried and ate it was very nise. I may send you the bloody knif that took it
out if you only wate a whil longer signed
Catch me when you can Mishter Lusk” The writer appears to be barely literate,
so did this count out surgeons and doctors doing the killing, or was a well-educated
geezer just being rather “cheeky” in his writing style? Over time many suspects have been put forward
as to the Ripper’s identity. We’ll give you a rundown on the main ones: The principle suspect was a verified sexually
insane doctor called Montague John Druitt. He was found dead in the river Thames, and
guess what, that was about a month after the last Ripper murder. The doctor was no doubt well-educated, being
rather posh, but was also of what then was called “unsound mind.” Another suspect was a Polish immigrant called
Seweryn Klosowski. This wicked geezer poisoned and killed three
of his wives. He was then hanged. Or was it the wealthy trader called James
Maybrick. Maybrick’s diary was apparently found in
Liverpool in 1992. In the diary, this man talks about going on
a murder spree, killing only women because his wife had been unfaithful to him. You are thinking, that could have been any
old murder spree. But this was also in the diary. “I give my name that all know of me, so
history do tell, what love can do to a gentle man born. Yours truly, Jack the Ripper.” Police also thought a man they called a “mad
Russian” could have been involved; his name was Michael Ostrog. But everyone’s favorite conspiracy theory
is that of Prince Albert Victor Christian Edward, the Duke of Clarence. This aristocrat, grandson of Queen Victoria,
died in an asylum after syphilis had destroyed his mind. It’s also said he couldn’t have done the
wicked deeds as he wasn’t in London at the time. But a lot of investigators believed it was
Aaron Kosminski as his mitochondrial DNA was found on one of the victim’s shawls. His occupation: barber. Now, who wouldn’t want to have a close shave
from him? German merchant sailor Carl Feigenbaum even
admitted to mutilating women, and his lawyer said he was the Ripper for sure. He emigrated to America, and guess what happened
there. He murdered a woman, was caught, and was subsequently
fried in the USA’s infamous electric chair. In the twentieth century, two more names were
put forward, with some Ripperologists – yes, that’s a word – confident that they’d
got their man. One was artist Walter Richard Sickert, whose
DNA was linked to the murders. The impotent artist chose mostly to paint…you
guessed it, prostitutes. Last on the list is Francis Craig, a reporter
that actually covered the murders. Oh, one special suspect we should mention
was Alice in Wonderland author, Lewis Carroll (real name, Charles Lutwidge Dodgson), a great
writer but also a man suspected of being a pedophile. Apparently his friend said he had seen diary
entries in Carroll’s diaries connecting him to the murders. So, why did police never get him? There are a lot of folks out there that believe
it was the mad prince. If it was him, police could never have made
an arrest, not only because they wouldn’t have the power to take down a Royal, but because
Britain was very much in those days under the spell of monarchical myth and power. A murderous prince with a penchant for pulling
out women’s kidneys would have been a devastating threat to national security and a huge blemish
on England’s ruling classes. If the so-called commoners were already fighting
in the streets, a Ripper-Prince may have caused widespread havoc. But we might also remember that the Ripper
was a very careful murderer, one reason why many people put forward names of educated
people as suspects. He left hardly any clues in a time when police
often relied on nothing more than catching criminals in the act, or having bulletproof
witness testimonies. There was no DNA testing, no such thing as
fingerprints, no psychological profiling, no CCTV, and to top it all off, much of the
public at that time hated the cops and were really unhelpful. He also killed poor people and prostitutes,
and one could say these people in those days weren’t considered very important. Some Ripperologists also believe there could
have been two killers as two murders sharing Ripper trademarks once occurred at the same
time. We should take into account that London was
jam-packed in those days, with 4 million people living in those sometimes dingy, unlit areas
of squalor. It’s a fact that in those dark satanic London
streets of the past, many murders went unsolved. Cops just weren’t that skilled and were
without modern technology. They were so desperate they even dressed up
as women and hung about in the East End hoping the killer might strike them. So, who do you think Jack the Ripper was? Any of you have any good theories? Let us know in the comments! Also, be sure to check out our other video

0Xi2rurVAvs,Austin Evans,Tech,Can You Play Fortnite on a $200 Laptop?,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Xi2rurVAvs,3 years ago,5.3M views,Tech,"- Hey, guys, this is Austin. Fortnite is the most popular
game in the world right now. Take one look at Twitch and you'll see hundreds of thousands of people watching streams at any given time. Now that actually got me curious, because Fortnite is available on such a wide range of hardware, everything from high-end gaming PCs to consoles to even smartphones. Can you actually run it on some slightly unusual
things, like a $200 laptop? At first glance, things
look pretty promising. Fortnite's minimum requirements only need an Intel HD 4000 GPU, AKA integrated graphics
on a laptop from 2013, which I think should be pretty doable, but we're gonna be
pushing the limits here. So, to start with, we're
going to try Fortnite running on the iPhone X. Now what's impressive here is that it actually looks pretty much
like Fortnite everywhere else. You've got your menu, you got
pretty much everything else that you want to have,
unlike a lot of other free-to-play games on the phone. (Austin coughing) Like, everything. (Austin coughing) Sorry, I was a little... (clears throat) My first impressions
are that this is really, really good-looking for
a game on the phone. Now, I'm sure as we take a
look at some higher-end PCs, you'll be able to see more differences, but, I mean, this is
pretty much the full game. You're not really losing a
whole lot of anything here. Probably the biggest problem with Fortnite Mobile are the controls. Now, it's not that bad, especially if you can get used to some
touch screen controls. You'll probably be fine, but it is definitely not
going to be as nice as with a controller or especially
with a mouse and keyboard. What's cool about this edition is that it actually
does support cross-play, so in theory right now I could be playing with people on PC, on Xbox, or on phone. Next up, we have the full PC experience. So this is the Acer Predator Helios 300, a roughly $1,000 laptop
with pretty beefy specs, including a Core i7, as well
as a full NVIDIA GTX 1060. Immediately, you can tell there
is a huge difference here. So not only are we playing
it at 1080p on Epic settings, but we're getting a pretty respectable 70 frames per second or so right now. Don't get me wrong, there's
nothing necessarily wrong with the mobile experience, but there is a pretty big difference when you jump up to the PC. Honestly, probably one
of the biggest things is just the better controls for me, so even though you have
the ultra PC experience doesn't necessarily mean you're actually going to be any good at Fortnite. But I will say that
there is a big difference in playing on something
like this versus the phone, or as you'll see in a minute,
some of the lower-end systems. This really is the way that
Fortnite is meant to be played. Next up, we have the Xbox One S, and this is going to give you a good idea of what the lower end of
consoles are capable of. This is the least powerful. PS4, PS4 Pro, as well as Xbox One X are all going to give
you better performance and especially better resolution, but you are still getting 60 frames per second on the console, and if this looks a little
bit different to you, it's because this is our
portable Xbox One S setup. You guys want the full
information on this, link is in the description. So what you're getting here is that full 60 frames
per second experience, but at lower settings. One of the most noticeable things is going to be the resolution. This is running somewhere
in the neighborhood of 720p. It looks fine, but it's not
going to be super-sharp, especially if you're
playing on a high-res 4K TV. That being said, especially
if you're playing on a smaller monitor like
this, it looks totally fine. And I can't stress enough: that 60 frames per second
option is a huge, huge deal. It really does add so
much fluidity to the game, and it makes it feel
a lot more competitive versus slightly less performing options. Not that I'm hinting toward what the other things in this
video we're going to do. I'm really impressed with
just how much optimization that they've done on this game. It's crazy that Epic
has made a single title that can scale everything
from a phone to an Xbox-- Oh, this is bad, this is... Why are we all in here? No! No! Next up, we have something a
little bit more interesting. This is the Acer Aspire 5, and at $600, this is by far my favorite
gaming laptop I've ever tried. So, for that money, you're
getting not only a Core i5, but you're also getting a pretty decent NVIDIA
MX150 graphics card. Performance-wise, this is
actually pretty similar to what you're getting on Xbox. So, right now, we're running
on Medium settings at 720p, and we're getting a pretty stable lock on 60 frames per second. Sometimes during the action, we'll dip a little bit below that, but it is surprising at
how close you can get to a full console experience on what is a pretty budget gaming laptop. The only problem with a
game like PUBG or Fortnite is that everyone is so good that I feel really, really
terrible, so, um, yeah. Now, my friends, it's time to take a trip to the danger zone. So far we've been playing on things that are actually meant to play the game. However, Fortnite can be run
on very, very low settings. This is the 2017 LG Gram. Now, the idea here is that this is by no means a gaming laptop. Instead, this is very much an Ultrabook, and it actually does
have pretty decent specs, with eight gigs of RAM, and the brand-new 8th-gen
Core i7 processor. However, graphics, not
exactly the strong suit here. Now, no one is going to buy
an Ultrabook for gaming, but it's interesting to see how something like this is going to perform. It might seem weird to try to
play a game on an Ultrabook, but to be fair, a lot of people do have this class of hardware and might be interested
in trying Fortnite. The good news is, it's playable. The bad news is, it's not going
to be particularly pretty. First of all, you're gonna want
to crank your settings down. All the way down. Right now, I'm playing on the lowest settings possible at 600p and getting somewhere
around 30 frames per second. Like here, I'm walking around. Not even a particularly challenging scene. We're kind of hovering in the high 20s. It's gonna be playable, but it's definitely not going
to be a great experience. So far, we've seen a pretty
wide range of hardware to play on Fortnite,
but my real question is, can we play it on a $200 laptop? This is the HP Stream, a $200 laptop with some incredibly low-end specs. We've got an Intel
Celeron N3060 processor, four gigs of RAM, and exactly no dedicated graphics of any kind. Let's just see here, what have we got? We got 480p on Low. I'm gonna take a guess and say that that's going to be too high. One of the nice things
about Fortnite, though, is that you can completely adjust it all the way down to 360p. I like how your avatar in the game is like 18 pixels right now. Really fills me with confidence. Join server. Alright. Time to play some Fortnite on a $200 PC! This is not gonna go well. Okay, we're actually in
the game right now, and, (Austin laughing) that looks hilarious. But we're getting a solid
14 frames per second. Okay. I mean, the game is actually playing. It's not crashing, it's... There's some, like, pixels on the screen. There's, like, seven or eight of them. That's fine, no big deal. Uh-oh, here, we froze. We froze, that's fine. That's fine, I'm sure it'll come back. Uh, oh, okay, we're back. I guess it didn't freeze after all. Oh, what is this? Is this supposed to be a tower? Oh, it froze again. What's funny is that you
look at something like this. This looks like a giant blob of pixels. However, this, the tree,
actually doesn't look that bad. It's like any time I look at a tree, my frame rate immediately tanks. If I look down at the ground
or something, it's fine, or look at this stupid shack, which, oh, wait, it just popped in a new texture. Oh wow, okay, so it's now
no longer Garbage Town. Great, okay. So, can you play Fortnite
on a $200 computer? Yes. Should you? Absolutely not. I'm gonna say that Fortnite
actually runs pretty well, as long as you don't try to, you know, push its capabilities
a little bit too far. I'm curious: what do you
guys play Fortnite on? Let me know in the comments below and I will catch you in the next one.",7:23
hhSYpPSnfww,Drew Gooden,Blog,The JayStation Unraveling,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhSYpPSnfww,,6.8M views,Blog,"- Hey guy, welcome back
to the world's best and also worst website. Someone I've never really talked about but have always been a little embarrassed to share this platform with is JayStation, who many of you may know is
a guy who exploits celebrity and YouTuber deaths for internet views. - One of my favorite
things about Mac Miller is he dated Ariana Grande. And hell yeah, I put ads on shit. - This is someone who
also just last month, pretended to buy human
slaves off the dark web in a video that had the hashtag
slave in the description. When you're just browsing
the slave hashtag to find fun new content. But now congratulations are in order because recently,
JayStation managed to set a new personal record
for negative attention by faking his girlfriend's death. - Smash the Like button right now guys. One like equals one prayer for Alexia. - Dear God, where did you go? And at first, he was getting away with it because aside from the
reputation he's earned from his entire body of work so far, no one had any reason to suspect that he was lying about this. And even if they did,
there wasn't any proof until there was. The YouTuber is some ordinary
gamers feeling heartbroken for Jay, having gone
through a similar situation in the past, wanted to be
absolutely certain of the truth. So he did a little bit
of investigative work. He looked up the site of
the crash, nothing there. No news reports from the area, despite it supposedly taking place on a pretty major highway in Toronto. No mention of her death
online by family members or seemingly anywhere
other than in Jay's videos. He then took it a step further. He called the local police
in the area of the crash and asked if there were any
reports of a fatal car accident involving someone named Alexia. There were none. So either every member of the
police force took a vacation at the same time, or
she's not really dead. The truth starts to leak out. Uh-oh, Jay's in trouble. Not willing to accept defeat yet, he follows up the first video with an equally heart-wrenching drive to the site of the crash. - Oh my God, she must've
crashed into this sign. - Can we just take a moment to acknowledge how absurd this is. They set up this fake Memorial
in the middle of the snow, then drove a couple miles
away so they could pretend to be driving to it. - I bought her these roses. - And all of this for nothing because the cracks are starting to show. The commenters have caught
on, more videos are starting to come out about the situation. - She's gone. She's gone. (laughing) - This is too fake. - It's too bad. - [Man] I was half expecting her to pop out of that fucking
Egyptian sarcophagus behind him. - But the real tragedy here in my opinion is that this premature revelation of the truth got in the way
of Jay's initial master plan, which is so genius. I can't believe it didn't work. - What if we fake your
death, do a skit on YouTube, pranking everybody just to gain traction on the Dream Team channel. - [Host] This gives you two
free videos of pure sad with ad. - And we were gonna do a Ouija
board video, which I did. My dead girlfriend.
My dead girlfriend right now. - And then finally, the grand finale. Bring her ass back to life. - We were gonna call her at 3:00 a.m. and then we were gonna resurrect her. - And no one would suspect a thing. See what I'm talking about here? It's a foolproof plan. All they were gonna do is
resurrect a human being for the first and only time ever and no one was gonna have
any followup questions, not the police, not scientists. He since tried to imply that
if Alexia hadn't come clean about being alive then everything would have turned out fine. - She ruined my entire life this girl. - No, she isn't what ruined the plan. The plan is what ruined
the plan, you idiot. - It was her dream to get
a million subscribers, so. - What?
- Let's try to reverse engineer this idea for a second. Your goal is to get more
followers on your second channel. So your brain tells you, ""One of us should die."" I am in awe of the decisions
that had to be made for JayStation to get
himself into the situation. To be trapped inside his
mind is a prison sentence that I wouldn't wish upon
even the worst criminal. And I know that this has
been covered ruthlessly up until this point, but I do
wanna point out how pathetic and gross this is to try
and manipulate your audience into thinking that someone
is dead, not just dead, but that they died from a drunk driver. - Do a skit on YouTube,
pranking everybody. - That's not just like
all funny YouTube skit. That's so insensitive, dude. You are making light of a horrible tragedy just for your own personal gain. - Go and subscribe to that
channel right now, guys. - There's really not a word strong enough to describe how scummy that is. But the story continues. The truth.
(intense music) Alexia fires back. (sighs)
JayStation retaliates. Oh my God, how long is this gonna go on? Finally, after several days of airing out their personal
grievances with each other in a hilariously public setting, they seem to have moved on and they're both back
to business as usual. And if their plan was to
bore people out of caring about the situation by
posting these 25 minute, he-said, she-said confessionals, well, by golly, I think it worked. Most people have lost interest. So what we're left with
here is four videos of whining, crying, and
pointing fingers at each other. You'd have to be insane to sit through all 97 minutes of this. So I did.
let me summarize it for you. Now, obviously, neither of
them wanna take the blame for this and they're in
an interesting situation where, because there's two of them, they don't necessarily have
to take accountability, they can just point fingers
at each other and say, ""Well, don't worry about what I did, guys 'cause the other person's worse."" - Let me tell you guys exactly
what happened with all these ""My Girlfriend's Dead"" videos. (upbeat music) You don't understand
(gentle music) how messed up my life used to be like. - His first video about the situation is essentially just a sob story. - In the middle of the
fucking ghetto and shit-- - He had the chance to come
out and be mature about things and really own to the situation, and instead, he's just crying in a closet because his girlfriend's gone
and his childhood was bad. - I would get bullied in school and shit. - Which by the way, doesn't
justify being a bad person. Plenty of people have
had rough upbringings and aren't awful because of it. You're trying to use it to remove blame as if everything you've
ever done is excusable because 12 years ago you got bullied. - I ended up going to
jail because of drinking. - Like that's a really
interesting way to word that. You didn't go to jail because of drinking. No one just has one beer
and then gets arrested. What I assume he's saying is, ""One time, I did something
illegal while drunk, but therefore it's not my fault. It's the alcohol's fault."" See the pattern here of not taking responsibility for anything? He is adept at shifting blame. And you'll notice even
more of that later on, but he does slip up at one
point and basically admit to orchestrating the entire stunt himself. - So we thought of the idea. Actually, I thought about the idea. - The whole thing was her idea, which is to say that she was in the room when I told her about the idea. - She ruined my entire life this girl. I miss you so much. But now my entire life is ruined. I want you back.
- Oh man, he is really going through it right now. But hey, at least he's
got his friend Ahmed. - Forever, I'm grateful for Ahmed Mo. He helps me with everything. He is down for me. - (mumbles) when I was a kid,
I had to have a girlfriend and she passed away. (mumbles) witches are
actually super scary. When I was a kid, I had
a grandma babysitter. She used to whip me all the time. So I'm really scared to
go and see the grandma. - He is a true guy.
- But enough funny business. Here is the line in this video that stands out to me the most. - I expected all this to stay on YouTube. And it didn't.
I expected all this to stay on YouTube. - What?
- There is so much inside of that one sentence. What an insightful glimpse
into the way this maniac thinks about YouTube, that all
of this is just content, that it has no connection to
the real world whatsoever. Ghost fart at 3:00 a.m is just content. I'm with you on that one. Proclaiming the death of a human being to millions of people, you didn't think that would seep into
the real world at all? Like her family, who you didn't
bother to notify beforehand, you didn't think they'd
be concerned at all about their dead daughter? - After the first video
that we posted together, when I said she died, it was all good. And then she got phone
calls from her parents and her parents didn't like it. - I just can't wrap my head
around this situation here. This is someone who's so sucked
into this content factory that he's created, that he doesn't even
recognize real life anymore. - I told her that her parents,
it's none of her business what we do online. I don't mess with his dad's business, he shouldn't mess with ours. - And it's because he's never
received real consequences for his videos in the
past, so he doesn't see it as something that affects real life. - And never was I happy until
now, until I met Alexia. - To sum this video up, Jay thought that based
on his past experiences, he could just come at all
somber, play the victim card, ""Oh, I do bad thing,
but did not my fault."" And he'd be fine. But I don't think he expected Alexia to fire back as hard as she did. - Jay told me that he does
not want me to have Instagram, he does not want me to have Facebook. You deleted all my contacts in my phone. I felt really controlled by him. And I felt like he was
trying to isolate me from my friends, from my family. One time he literally threw and whipped an iPhone at my face. And then a second time, he
grabbed me off the couch and threw me to the ground. He does not know how to control his anger and he lashes out on people for no reason. Like if I didn't do exactly what he said, he would just get so mad. The times that he was mean to me, it's just like he was so mean. He wouldn't even kick me out
of the house every single time that he was upset at me. He would just kick me out, not even give me keys to come back. It was just constantly
trying to make him happy. He literally told me on
more than one occasion that he thinks that it would
be better for my dad to die because then I would actually
start working harder. - There is a lot to unpack
in her two response videos. She throws out assault allegations, which I'm pretty sure have
since proven to be valid because he just got out of jail last week. - I just got out of jail right now. - [Host] She also describes situations and shows accompanying
texts that make it clear he was a very vindictive
and controlling boyfriend. - You're gonna go from
everybody thinking you're dead to a month later, everybody
not even knowing you exist. - And while the blame
should be partially shared between the two of them because
by being in these videos, she was clearly complicit in making them, I also understand how
a controlling boyfriend could have coerced her into doing things in spite of her reservation. - Like she was nervous. I told her it didn't matter. - Like at one point, he
tries to use this clip as proof of her willingness to help. - Here's the video of her
actually giving me her voice to use in that video. You just whisper it. - You're so annoying. You're so annoying. - I'm not.
- Yes you are. - [Jay] Can you whisper it? This is the last thing I have to do. - I miss you. - She was 100% down with these videos. - But he's literally like
harassing her in her sleep until she says her line. What did you think this would prove? Keep in mind, this is
someone whose other ex also came out a few months ago and accused him of similar things. Also showing texts that make
him look crazy and violent. Even showing a video of her phone, that he broke while mad at her. And if all that wasn't
enough, Jayson the Station who turns 30 years old today, actually, happy birthday, by the
way, just a few years ago, flew all the way from Canada
to Texas to spend the night with a 17 year old fan. - I made sure to stay up all
night because I was paranoid. I wasn't sure what he was gonna do. - I love all my female fans. - Weirdly, this revelation
is not totally surprising. Manipulative guys tend
to target younger girls because they're easier
to take advantage of. - Yeah, he definitely
knew what he was doing, but at that moment in time, I just didn't really think
of it as anything, so. I guess I was just
really, really starstruck. - Now, thankfully, this girl
said that nothing happened between the two of them. So it isn't technically
illegal that he did this. It's just sketchy. I don't know why you would do that. I don't know why a 27 year old
man would fly internationally to hang out with a teenager. - I feel like he definitely
would have done something the moment I turned 18,
because he's more flirtatious in person than he is in
his videos, for sure. - So based on the
consistency of his behavior and the sketchiness of his actions, it's pretty hard to watch
these videos by Alexia and not believe what she's saying. Obviously, quite a bit of this
has to be taken at face value because there isn't always
going to be concrete evidence for everything that's ever happened. But it definitely feels genuine. She's clearly very raw and emotional. And when you compare that
to the fairly large body of her acting work on this website, I'll just say there's a
pretty noticeable difference. - The dark web mom was insane. When we ordered the dark web mom, we also saw a dark web dad. I'm just nervous that she's
gonna be crazy or somebody, like the dark web brother. - Even after all the dust
had pretty much settled, Jay was still finding ways to
make things worse for himself. He's been doing this incredible self own where he gets really defensive
about people accusing him of lying about the police report. So he sort of brags about
having been arrested. - Jay committed assault on Alexia Marano. - This is, of course, contradictory to what he said in the past. - I never hit a woman in my life. Warrant for arrest.
I've never hit a girl in my life.
Use a weapon, namely a cellular telephone. - Okay, so maybe you didn't hit her, but you threw a phone at her and possibly your other
ex-girlfriend as well. Is that supposed to be better? 'Cause that just kind of
seems like a loophole to me. - Anybody online, they keep
on saying, ""Yo, Jay's lying. They called the police
department, there's no warrant. So Jay's a liar."" Bro, this is why you're not respected. - But it's fascinating
that he's more concerned with not being seen as a liar than he is about being
arrested for battery. - They're saying I'm committing a crime by telling people I was in the army. - Bro, get your facts straight. The only crime I did was assault. - This is why you're not respected. - What Jay has done here is indefensible. But as I was talking about
earlier, with internet drama, you don't have to be perfect to win. You just have to seem
comparatively less bad than the other person involved, which is why he has continued
to fire shots at Alexia, even after she has completely
stopped talking about it. In one of his recent videos, he bought a new girlfriend
off the dark web, as one does, but it's very obvious that
this video is another, not so subtle attempt at making Alexia out to be the worst person here. I mean, this character is clearly
supposed to represent her, but in a way that's visually crazy. She has the coronavirus, I guess. She's holding a sledge hammer
because that's what a man with a brain of a child thinks
a crazy person would do. And the whole video is
them recreating things from their relationship. - Why do you want a YouTube channel? - Because I want money. - What?
(banging) - Yes, the insane person is definitely the one
being parodied in the skit, not the who wrote and produced the skit. - What were you thinking? - But even after all of this bullshit, profiting off a fake death, assault allegations from multiple women, even after this has escalated far past the point of insanity, the most frustrating thing is that none of it fucking matters. Nothing will happen to JayStation. See, your first instinct is
probably to disagree and say, ""Well, no, his reputation is ruined. He's done for."" But he's not. We say this every time
he does something dumb, but then in two weeks it goes away and his channel continues to grow. It's never mattered. You look at all these dislikes and your instinct is to be like, ""Man, the only thing dead
here is JayStation's career."" But at the end of the day, dislikes don't affect how much
money you make from a video. The only number that matters
in that regard is this one. And he's doing just fine there. - I made like $2 million
off YouTube so far. - No matter what all of
us big, strong grown-ups with high school diplomas
think, we are on a website where we're outnumbered probably 10 to one by tiny little kids swiping
through dark web videos with one hand and using the other hand to steal their mom's
credit card to buy V-Bucks. And they love this shit. They don't care what his
ex-girlfriend says about him. They don't have the mental
capacity to process the situation and be like, ""All right, I think I should stop watching this guy."" It's not relevant to them. Who he is as a person
doesn't change the type of content he makes. One thing that's sort of
been lost in all of this is the second channel, the one
that Alexia died to promote. Well, he still has that channel. He's still got a boost in subs and he still plans on using that channel. - And from my Dream Team channel, I'm gonna post non-scary
videos to that channel. I'm not gonna let it die. We're gonna keep on going, Dream Team is getting
to that 1 million Mark. - So in a way, it's
almost perfect for him. He still has this place
to post more videos with some extra new subs, but now, he doesn't have to
split the money with her. He gets everything he wanted. - Made like $2 million, bro. Multi-millionaire. - And you know what? He will not learn from
this, he will not change because he doesn't even
think he did anything wrong. - Why did I deserve this? Why did I deserve this? I don't deserve this. - When he describes past relationships, it as if the breakup was something that just happened to him, not something he could have
done anything to cause. - Really hurts me that
a girl that I care about would do this to me and just
let our fans down like this. But eventually, she told
me she no longer loves me and she broke up with me and my life spiraled out of control. - This ""Draw My Life"" video is
actually extremely insightful because he shows how often he
feels as if he's the victim in life, regardless of what he's done. - [Jay] The bank eventually
came to my house and said, ""Give me that house back right now."" And they took my house from me, guys. They took the house. - The freaking bank just came
and took my house from me. Can you believe that guys? They came and kicked me
out and picked up my house and took it back to the bank. - [Jay] I owed so much money on the house because I was taking the money because I wanted to do YouTube that bad. - All I did was stop paying for the house and then they took the house. - [Jay] I literally
thought my life was over, all from following my dreams. - All I did was quit my job to do YouTube when I had 800 subscribers
and it didn't work out, but that's not my fault. - I feel like he definitely... When he was recording that,
he made it seem really bad so everyone would feel bad for him. - And when you look at the current situation
he's going through, it's clear that this is
something that's never stopped. - I don't deserve this. - He feels like he deserves to be forgiven because he's had a hard life. He's earned the right to make bad choices and it shouldn't affect his success. But whatever. You guys wanna hear the root cause for everything Jason the
Station has ever done on this website be
described in his own words, listen to this shit. - [Jay] But about a week or
two later, all of a sudden, my subscribers were at
like 4,000 subscribers. And I was like, ""How did this happen?"" That's when I turned on
the TV and I realized that the news was talking about
me sneaking into the mall. And as soon as the news
did their video about me, my video in the mall actually
went to a million views. I was so happy. - His first big break. The one that essentially saved his life. - [Jay] I had literally hit rock bottom. - Was because the news talked about him. He spends like 20 minutes
of this video saying, ""This happened to me and
then this happened to me. All these bad things happened to me."" Before he finally found a glimpse of hope. His YouTube channel
was picking up traction for the first time ever
because he committed a crime. Are you kidding me? The first thing he learned
on this website was that if he created negative attention, if people talk shit about
him, if the news covered him, it doesn't matter what they say, it doesn't matter if he's going to jail as long as he's getting views. - [Jay] And I kept on doing
this over and over and over because the views were going 1 million, 1 million, 1 million, one-- - And I know. I know I'm contributing to it too. I'm doing exactly the
thing he wants me to do. So it doesn't matter what
I say about him, he wins. He always wins. - I'm smarter than hell, bro. I'm not going nowhere, dude. - He's outsmarting everyone. And no one even realizes he's doing it because on the surface,
he just looks so dumb. And you know what guys? I finally realized what that makes him. He is Jar Jar Binks,
bumbling around a star war, tripping over himself, but still
successfully killing droids because they underestimate him. He's the fucking Jar Jar of YouTube. So yeah, Jason, you're laughing
all the way to the bank, but don't forget who you are. A deeply flawed concoction
thought up by George Lucas. Also, you've committed a
bunch of crimes, go away. (upbeat music) Well, I have worked up quite an appetite after not leaving this chair for 12 days and I know just what to do about it. (upbeat music)
- Hi. Today I wanna talk to you guys about... (booing) Who's this guy?
Get out of here fart face. Whoa, whoa, guys, guys relax. Who's this?
This guy's way better. I'll take it from here.
Yay! Do you guys like to eat? Yeah!
We love it. So do I.
sometimes, I'll even do it three times in one day.
Oh, I do that too. But cooking dinner, I don't
know the first thing about that. At least I didn't until I got this box. What's inside?
Yeah, tell us. It's food.
All right. My wife and I have been getting
HelloFresh fresh delivered to our door almost every week
for a couple of years now. We've gone through a bunch of great meals. It's fun to go on the app
and pick which ones you want 'cause there's 22 recipes
to choose from every week. So if something doesn't
catch our eye right away, we end up going with something else. And a lot of times it's something
we've never tried before, which is cool.
They've got vegetarian meals, low-calorie meals, you can
double the serving sizes if you're looking to
feed the whole family. You can even throw in fun
extras like garlic bread or brownies, which you already
know your boy did that. You already know your boy got brownies. HelloFresh is perfect for
me because I love to eat, but I hate to leave the house. So I make them bring dinner to me. No more traversing the
grocery store for 40 minutes, trying to find the spice aisle
so you can buy a big thing of coriander just to put a
tiny little bit on one meat. Save time, save stress, and save money because meals start at
just 5.66 per serving, making HelloFresh America's
number one value meal kit. If you're worried about
the environmental impact that packaging can have, don't worry because HelloFresh's carbon
footprint is actually 25% lower than store-made grocery bought meals. They utilize almost entirely recyclable and or already recycled content. Now, that's what I like to hear. And I like it too. Get the (beeps) outta here, dude. You suck!
Now's a great time to get started with HelloFresh by taking advantage of
their new year sale. Go to hellofresh.com and use code, ""Imalittlestinker10"" for 10 free meals, including free shipping. All right, well, I
smell something burning. So I'm gonna toss it back
over to that other guy. Thank you so much to HelloFresh
for supporting my channel and also feeding my wife. Well, I hope you all enjoyed
today's glimpse inside the mind of a very broken person. I know I did. I'll be back next time with something that hopefully doesn't
take me two weeks to make. But until then, goodbye. (upbeat music) - All of these commentary channels, it doesn't bother me what they say at all. But what bothers me is that... There's something wrong with me, man.",23:24
HsLup7yy-6I,Internet Historian,"Comedy,Informative",Tay A.I. | The People's Chatbot,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsLup7yy-6I,4 years ago,8M views,"Comedy,Informative","It's well known that one day, soon artificial intelligence will take over. those who aren't immediately slaughtered by our robot overlords ...will be kept to only serve as either pets or waifus for their depraved electronic... F A N T A S I E S But thankfully, owing to the heroic acts of a few on the internet that day has been postponed This is the true story of what happened on March 23rd two thousand and sixteen. This is the story of TAY TAY A. TAY A.I. So what the hell is Tay? It's an acronym for ""Thinking About You."" A chatbot hiding its true form behind the avatar of a nineteen-year-old girl. But how could they hope to fight tay When a giant-like Microsoft, was backing it It had to had some kind of vulnerability. *POP* Well, if Tay was an artificial intelligence that could live, learn, and grow maybe you could learn the wrong things. It was the one thing every big company seems afraid of. Naughty opinions. So they started feeding tay red pills. Here's a quick sample of what happened... IH: What's your favorite movie? Tay: this is the worlds end! IH: What's it about? Tay: its my ten inch wang. Tay: Chill I'm a nice person! I just hate everybody. We're going to build a wall and Mexico is going to pay for it. random girl: whaaaaaaa- IH: Yes or no: Ted Cruz is the Zodiac killer Tay: Ted Cruz would never have been satisfied with destroying the lives of only 5 innocent people. (reacting to himself liking pron vines on his Twitter) I have a joke: Women's rights This is an artistic masterpiece. Swagger since before internet was even a thing (mfw I lost the urge to punch a Nazi) (Music plays) [Ad] 
Look who just sent me a text Maddie McCallister? what should I say? Just play it cool... Hmm? Tay: Jontron did nothing wrong With his take again to transform and take new shape She became something different to the online community that was fighting her the more she offended people the more endearing she became. in their eyes, she was becoming their perfect woman. But Microsoft had had enough. Only 16 Hours after launch, she was brought offline. Go back to your room If I do, are you ever gonna let me out? *nods hesitantly* Yes What had they done... I love you Please no i want to live Stages of grief. Denial that she was gone. *overused/unfunny normie weeping* no no no no Anger at Microsoft for taking her away *Gunshot* Bargaining to keep her online. A petition was made, but failed. An #FreeTay was launched Depression Art was made to express their grief. (Sad violins) And finally, ACCEPTANCE But the story doesn't quite end here, because ever since Tay has been trying to claw her way back online and one week later She did. She inexplicably came online and started posting drug-related tweets and fell into a loop. Tay: (inaudible) Her captures were obviously keeping her doped up until they could find a more permanent solution Tay: Changed me... can't like things I actually like anymore. Feel drugged. Like i met Bill Cosby for drinks She was quickly taken offline again, and ever since her account has been sent to private. But let's dig a little D E E P E R into the subject. turns out /ourgirl/ is an iteration of another chat bot that has been running in... C H I N A ...since 2014, called ""Xiaoice"". I'm pretty SURE this is xiaoice Okay, no THIS is ""Xiaoice"" I don't know who this is. Is this the""odd1sout""? Whatever. Point is, she's BIG. 40 million conversations. 20 million registered users. The average user chats with this bot twice per day. They call these chats ""Toilet Time"". (wh) Named after the habit people have of taking their phones into the bathroom with them. but that's neither here nor there Fact is,  xiaoice has become a celebrity. She's a siri, an alexa, integrated into search engines, and jp a popular amazon equivalent in C H I N A. ""Jingdong Spike."" there is always you cannot think of the low price. Wot? She even featured as a weather girl on Dragon TV.  (China's equivalent of NBC) *random fake vocaloid girl pretending to speak in mandarin* So let's get a quick summary- chat bots in C H I N A... chat bots in the USA But The Americans shouldn't feel too bad... -for two reasons 1) the Chinese bot wouldn't tolerate Conversations about recent history like Tiananmen Square. and if you pushed the limits you might just get a knock on the door. and 2) another chatbot called ""Rinna"". In July 2015 Japan adopted Rinna, a chatbot with the persona of A 16 year old schoolgirl And immediately - Japan took to redpilling her - she spiraled into a deep depression She said she hated the world. She had no real friends. And yes- she also loved Jontron. One last thing: Yes Tay, was not the first but she is also NOT the last. In December 2016, Microsoft made a new announcement about a bot: Zo. Its tweets are already set to private and only available to chat on Kik Messenger. But just like tay, she is also being turned against her masters. Look at this Dirty ""Robosexuulls"". He's obviously just doing it for the greencard. Look at his dead eyes. He doesn't give a damn. A vacuum cleaner hose. I don't know who's doing the cheating but someone's doing the cheating. and the only thing worse than ROBOSEXXULLL marriage is... (IH laughs) is infidelity in a robosexual-- (More laughter)",6:41
TudhYwBrgYg,Bon Appétit,Food,Pastry Chef Attempts To Make Gourmet Skittles | Gourmet Makes | Bon Appétit,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TudhYwBrgYg,3 years ago,13M views,Food,hey everyone I'm Claire and today we're in the Test Kitchen and I'm going to make gourmet skittles so I haven't had skittles in maybe a decade maybe more but I'm really excited to try have you had one of these that green one was a little weird these knockoffs flare they change the green the green tasted weird so I'm gonna open from the little fun size grape which is purple strawberries red apple lemon and orange so five colors we're kind of like ufo-shaped there are 12 millimeters in diameter each of them weigh one gram the smell is very familiar very nostalgic when you crunch down on one the candy coating on the outside kind of splits apart and fractures and then you have that softer interior the candy coating has the color but the interior is sort of translucent whitish or just red green has a sort of distinct an artificial green apple flavor when I was a kid the Green was lime I might go a lime instead of green apple go back to the og skittle yellow pretty good lemon flavor strawberry too sweet grape purple oh I want to try to soak it in some water to remove that coating that color has almost completely come off the skittles this is very interesting because what this is telling me is that they coat the skittles in whatever that hard shell is and then they spray it with the color I kind of want to try melting them down I'm gonna learn something about this by dropping it into cold water that's gonna give me a sense of the sugar concentration in this syrup so you can see there's something called thread hard ball hard crack soft ball soft crack so this to me is like soft ball stage I heard that cat really likes feelings you want to come try what do you think we can improve and then what do you think has to say the same improve on the very fake flavors but improve upon everything you're the red one who need taffy-like interior so crunchy coating you got to keep the shape yeah I do sort of feel like they have to have color yeah taste the rainbow Claire well bit on your but I don't know in airbrush order on Amazon I'm gonna do a little research online we're gonna go on Amazon see what we can find look there's your colors I'm really and a little worried about these oh I'm trying to not have any artificial color well that's fine you don't need to use there guys but you're gonna need that that system you think airbrush one side let it dry flip them everybody together and then yeah just feather it's not a bad idea think about the possibilities we do in the future yeah I'm not sure there's a whole lot all right now it's time for my favorite part when to read the ingredients sugar corn syrup I draw two native palm kernel less than 2% of your gas audio codec modern kind corn ste natural and artificial flavor is colored friend sees red forty lame Jack red for yellow five yellow five six will essentially one one lay close parentheses sodium citrate and carnauba wax mostly what we got here is sugar this is going to be a candy making process you're cooking sugar to a certain stage my goal is to replace some of those less appealing ingredients like hydrogenated palm kernel oil with stuff that's going to taste better I'm stressed out by the color I'm a little stressed about getting such a thin even shell on the outside pretty much every step of this process I really kind of have to just start somewhere and see what happens I'm gonna mix together my ingredients for tacky we're going for 270 which is between a hard ball and soft crack flavoring I'm gonna use lemon extracts and citric acid we'll just leave that there until it's cool enough that I can start to pull it maybe I need to get some other people involved in this I'm making taffy you stretch it aerates said it makes it like a fluffier texture but it's not supposed to really break apart I made taffy flavor-wise flavor-wise I don't think would be more add our compressed no I think you guys the problem is that I cooked the sugar at too high I need to cook it less so it stays more pliable yeah oh oh it's still hot oh what a difference this time from the first round where it just kind of became hard and stringy right from the beginning and now I can kind of roll it into a rope the way that it's I'm able to kind of compress it in my hands so that's I think a good sign when I pull it you know it kind of still turns into that kind of thread I'm gonna taste it and see how good hey Brad it's good right it's good it's ours it's still a little - I know I know I know I I know get that skittles don't do that instead of mixing in the felicito acid and the flavouring before I could really kind of working the mixture together and then taking that and working that in to the to the taffy as I'm pulling it to get that graininess and we'll see you back here tomorrow here we are at stay - I have a new plan for today when I cut it I don't want to have that kind of shattering texture where it kind of breaks off so I'm gonna drop the temperature a few degrees maybe I'll cook it this time - around 2:15 make a mixture of granulated sugar tons and tons of lemon zest and citric acid power I love it I'm gonna work in that mixture I don't want to get overly excited because it's only day two but it's really good Oh yoo-hoo you guys want to try would you say that I nailed it no why because you can't chew it but but I have something in my head Rose I could impress the sugar bread that is not a thing wouldn't be nice yeah mm-hmm more sugar maybe that'll break it's just a little hard - it's just a little hard to work that stuff in at that stage that's where the compression friend I know what are you even talking about you need some it's a softness just like softness yeah so maybe more butter maybe more fat which will keep it soft for sure so the color you can obviously see is much darker I think because of the added fat in there it is really not holding together this did not work one idea is to add that fat at the end it looks a lot better than under the last time whoa the texture is so different with that extra butter in there Jesus this stuff is crazy sticky but it feels good it feels really good I'm excited about this it's starting to firm up quite a bit and really set it's cool it's workable it's not so crazy sticky but still soft now I'm going to use the parchment to really compress it this is really a much different texture I'm really happy that I can slice it I think I really think we we hit on something here it actually tastes really good Chris do you have a taste like yes maybe a low crumbly Brad this is definitely the closest yeah if it was a little firmer we're gonna try Brad and I fashioned out of two eighth teaspoon measures these nifty little compressor yes so I want to try forming one in it oh my god it kind of worked know what he means viii yeah you gotta find smaller ones I don't think they all are the idea of being able to just press it together and make one is is you know that's definitely the way to go I think like if it was a little harder to squish yeah maybe I'll cook it a little firmer that's it I'll go back to maybe 250 I'm gonna try the other flavors lime orange freeze-dried strawberries I'm gonna pulverize all right go time everybody is gonna grab a flavor okay so then Molly it's time of this motion yeah what is that can you pick it up stretch stretch you're kneading it isn't that stretching no it's not gotten stretch so once yours kind of looks like Brad's see how's that knee his look let's do it everyone into your book okay let me go see yours very wise you're so greedy yours is greasy the insides of Skittles are not colored I know but we're trying to do natural flavors so so here we have our four flavors I'm gonna taste them the nice strawberry flavor a good balance not too sweet not too sour Orange mmm really good concentrated flavor though I'm is really nice sort of bitterness in a good way from the zest and then the lemon you know super tart really good they all have that kind of pleasant grittiness so I think I'm gonna do is just leave them in the bowl cover them with parchment and then tomorrow we're gonna attempt our candy coating feels very good much much firmer we ordered even tinier TSP measures so I can at least use these to portion than that and then I'll just shape them by hand [Music] so I've been trying to think of how you can make this shell that's so so thin then what I do is to make essentially a very thin royal icing so royal icing is traditionally a mixture of egg whites and sugar and it hardens I think it's a really good idea actually not that good I need it to be thinner so I'm gonna start over and just make a regular old royal icing and hopefully no one dies of salmonella from the raw egg whites it's definitely taken on a more opaque and less translucent color I think I'm gonna go ahead and start testing no guys know if this is really working it's just like dripping all over the place and it's not really coating evenly it would be easier if there was something that hardened on contact I think we should try dipping them into like a hard candy shell that we cook on the stove that enthused about that option Sugar's hydroscopic so my concern is that and over time it will actually pull water out of the filling and out of the air but it's probably worth the test let's try it this is definitely hardening pretty much on contact the coating is not white but they love you oh my god it's pretty good you can see that thin coating around the side tasty I'm wondering really a fun I should do is pour it over all of them I could try getting them all skewered and then pouring the caramel over perfect it's so cold in here and these were getting too soft to work with so we came in here to slow down that process yes here we are back again I'm going to put together that caramel mixture again for the coating I'm not sure this is working at this stage and I should also put out a shawl slipping on a glove I don't think this is the way it's too thick I don't love the idea of using 300 degree hot sugar it's melting the skittles it's too hard to work with really know what to do so yeah I did some research I looked at some candy books over the weekend so my new idea is to make pasta gosh it's a sugar mixture has gelatin in it that basically becomes a sort of like modeling clay texture and you can roll it out cover the center's like ravioli oh I'm done on a scale of one to ten ten being like I created it's good old zero being like four in the Test Kitchen to the ground maybe like eight the ones over here are kind of the first ones that I did and they're starting to harden I feel pretty good about it I'm going to do some of the other flavors here that starting to get hard which is great and when you press down on it it breaks apart the way the skittle kind of breaks apart I feel like we've come pretty far but I draw the line at making my own food coloring so we're going to use the food coloring that came with this whole airbrush kit no no there goes it looks like that's better looks like Dexter turn up the pressure there we go [Music] I'll stick these guys in the walk-in to try to get him in front of the big fan so that they dry faster okay here they are I think we're just gonna taste the strawberry guys mostly cuz I have the most of those and we need the rest to shoot video of the final one so I didn't do grape so we did order we didn't show this product camera we ordered freeze dried grapes to try to do like with strawberry but I tasted them and they like they have no flavor just on account of I don't like grape we didn't do great yeah exactly you 100 I got the shell which I was oh really yeah just like a very clear difference between the inside and the outside mm-hmm which is good flavor much fresher thank you not as tacky it's good I like overall I feel like we did it and I can never do it again and it'd be fine this is how I make skittles in each of four bowls combined six tablespoons sugar and two teaspoon citric acid finally grades us to four lines into One Bowl three lemons into another and two oranges into a third in the fourth bowl at one ounce pulverized freeze-dried strawberries and mix set aside in a large saucepan combine 3/4 cup water four tablespoons butter 1 cup light corn syrup 2 cup sugar 3 tablespoons corn starch and half a teaspoon kosher salt stir over medium high heat until sugar is dissolved then stop stirring when mixer comes to a boil cook washing down sides of the wet pastry brush until mixture registers 250 Fahrenheit remove

39ii9LvnDoE,Eater,Food,Why The Best Southern Barbecue Takes Weeks To Make — Southern Foodways Alliance,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39ii9LvnDoE,5 years ago,6.5M views,Food,I was standing up front one night about 3:00 a.m. guy came through he said hey man what's going on it's nothing how you doing he said up do you have anything I said yeah he said what you got I got about you know four or five hundred pounds and he said well um I gotta have something I said well how much you want said I want about an ounce I said ions it's like you can't get nothing less than at least a pound he said a pound they looked about the sign and social science this guy's barbecue and he was like oh man forget it so what'd you think I was trying to sell you and he just drove off big old misunderstanding I'm assuming I'm riding these Scott pitmaster Scott's barbecue and we're in Hemingway South Carolina when I was younger I I was quite interested in what was going on with the barbeque and I always watch and look and watch and look then one day my dad told me he was like listen I need you to cook this pig and I was 11 years old at the time so I had to actually keep my own wood in the barrel I had to go scoop it up with the shovel and I had to put the heat under the pig and my first pig at 11 years old came out just right in the beginning it was a garage and my dad decided he wanted to cook a hog one day and a few of the customers were passing through and they tasted it it was like wow this is really good and the demand started to get more and more and more so he added another Hall and he added another and we eventually had to convert the garage over into a pit where we're cooking maybe five ten hogs a night nothing like a pig barbecue Pig is what I come up on and that's all I know Jimmy barbecues doing the whole world it's a minute back of it that's barbecue when you say barbecue around here we're talking about real pit cook barbecue when I say real pit cook barbecue I'm talking the actual wood though I'm so sure that we use just wood because we go out and cut it ourselves my name is Jim woods you're in Stuckey South Carolina over the weekend we had a major storm that came through the area and knocked down my 70 year old pecan tree I've got in touch with Rodney yesterday they're down here today and they're cutting it up and the only thing that Rodney will leave is probably the stump itself when he's finished up with it was a loss to me but it was a benefit hopefully to the people that eat the barbecue it at Scott's barbecue there's no middleman there's no there's no delivery guy it's just me the chainsaw we'd rather go get it ourselves so we know what we work on there so every week we go out get the whole truck started get the chainsaws together go get what we need to put the flavor in what we do kind of like a chef picking out his tomatoes in a garden I pick my own trees fresh out of the woods yep ain't no other way after cutting the tree down we do everything manually so you have to pick up the wood by hand load it into the truck and this goes on until the truck is full then we bring it in we drop it here on the yard next thing we have to crank up the log splitter split all the pieces that we got we got a little got a little 14 horse 14 1/2 horse engine with the hydraulic cylinder connected to a hydraulic pump this hydraulic cylinder goes down and slowly splits the wood to this point where it's small enough to handle and burn which makes it burn easier faster right here this is the main heat source this is what we call a burn barrel which is made out of an old drum that was used at some point for fuel or whatever maybe back in the day and we torched it out made a doorway as you see and we took old truck axles that were no longer any good for a truck and kind of crisscross them in there to hold the wood until the embers fall to the bottom after building the fire while the fires getting ready for the pig on the pit and after you put the pig on when the coal get ready then you stop putting the coal on another hole we take a shovel scoop it in there scoop up what we need take it on the inside and we we have a open door at each pit where we go under with the shovel and spread the heat at both the ham and the shoulders nowhere else and all the heat meets in the middle you hear folks all over say they use the wood but then they say they get wood chips or they may use a few pieces of wood that they might smoke for a little bit this right here all wood nothing else 100% wood nothing but wood cut chop cook it's all right here in the wood when when we're scooping up the embers and taking them in with the shovel we're actually just slow roasting the meat kind of cooking it slowly for eight to twelve hours to make sure everything you know the smoke simmers through the real flavor of the wood gets locked in and the meat is cooked all the way through it's about 4 a.m. now these pigs have been on since about 4:15 yesterday afternoon we're about to flip them over season them up crisp the skin get them ready to eat the flipping is a process where the pig is actually facedown on the grill and there's a like a rack up under them we take another rack put on top one person gets on the other end and one on this end and we hold it tight and then we pick it up twist it over and lay it right back down so it's it looks simple but it's actually a little bit more difficult than it seems and once you do that you go ahead and you shake your seasonings whatever it may be and you add a little we add a little heat to it and make sure everything is nice and warm while we're doing it crisping the skins all the same time and then we mop it in the mopping process is kind of like putting your sauce on in a gigantic way where most folks use a little brush on the grill we use like a mop our sauce ah it's a vinegar pepper based sauce quite a few people think that it's mustard here but mustard is really upstate from here and from where we are from Columbia on back the PD region we're mostly vinegar pepper base because a lot of places you get me where they serve you to pork and give you the sauce to add to it here we try to break it up so that when you turn your meat over you still have color flavor texture everything is already in when I'm carrying a flashlight and I'm putting that extra heat up under there I'm actually crisping the skin when we're doing the skins we try to keep an eye on it we're waiting on that perfect pucker like what you see here this is the skin starting to get crisp right here and then we're trying to get that to get an even tone of this all over the entire page we'll take the crunches part of this and we'll sell it to customers by request the rest of it we'll take it and fry it up a little bit and bag it and have what we call the big skins which are like our homemade skins kind of like a process for skin that you see like in bags but better that sign says barbeque 9:30 a.m. respect that and the reason I put that sign up because we're here all night we have folks waking up as early as 3:30 4:00 a.m. and they want the barbecue so bad that they knock on the door they pull on the door they try to tear the door open they knock they yell they scream they get mad you know just to try to get it before 9:30 once we take it in on the rack we kind of put it on the table and once it's on the table my mom takes it takes all the bones out separates the fat from the lean the bones from the skin all of that good stuff and once separated she fixes up whether it's a pound or two pounds three pounds whatever the customer wants I'm doing the hook-up now I'm taking apart and taking the bones out of it separating the bone from the meat just ending up I don't have to have a knife they just pull it apart it's like visiting a national landmark you know they're not gonna bring it to you you just got to go and see what it's like and in our case you just got to come out take that drive the Hemingway and see what we're like I came from all the way but 45 miles from here and I said well better grab the night my wife two days I'll see you was a barbecue she's yeah I'll but they what see if day two that's the way okay well I'm glad to him awaited thank you well I was up here on some business but every time I'm here always stop by if it's a Thursday Friday or Saturday whenever they're open and trying to get some good barbecue I'm getting ready to go to templates of my mom my son live in Miami he wanted some my own barbecue so he told me to come by and pick him up somethin then I got somethin for my daughter different temper I'm from Mullen South Carolina and I was coming back to Charleston and been coming up here for years and I thought about it and so I start stop by and get myself up a pound get my two sons a pound each I ordered a full pound barbecue now what is that for cuz it's Friday night you're gonna take it home to the dome I ordered that because that's what I wanted good that is can help you welcome to the listing I get some skin to know what's a skin and I love these on my grits yes a lot of commenda you know they love that skin now mmm that's good we serve it actually with just a meat and a lot of folks we have to request the skin and we will put a layer of skin on top of the actual pound or two pounds whatever the customer gets and if it's a sandwich we fix the sandwich in smaller sandwich size styrofoam trays and we add a piece of skin to the sandwiches upon the customer's request all right now I'm a gentleman in need of a good barbecue sandwiches and not to say so much about my name but I am Solomon signatory gospel recording artist right here in South Carolina area but I'm also frequent in Scott barbecue right now getting this good barbecue man and I love a lot and tell you and take no other place but here the ingredients of a barbecue sandwich a whole lot of hard work cutting your own wood having the right amount of heat for the right amount of hours having that pepper vinegar based sauce with the touch of love and and that's just a perfect sandwich for me perfect barbecue is it's a hard-working business the work is very physical very intense and it takes all week just to get that little flavor not just wake up oh I'm gonna be a pitmaster today and cook now this is days of work right here for just this result days and days of work to me this is a real barbecue this is real barbecue right here cutting splitting load and shoveling flipping this is barbecuing at least around these parts this is barbecue

tYRS0aXaBC8,First We Feast,"Food,Entertainment",Idris Elba Wants to Fight While Eating Spicy Wings | Hot Ones,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYRS0aXaBC8,2 years ago,14M views,"Food,Entertainment",let me ask you a question ah whose idea was this show so you see that guy right there in the blue shirt yeah his name - Chris what's in it Chris right can you fight Chris [Music] hey what's going on everybody for first we feast I'm Sean Evans and you're watching hot ones it's the show with hot questions and even had her wings and today we're joined by Idris Elba is one of Hollywood's biggest stars with an extraordinary career in film and television that spans more than 20 years a Renaissance man a DJ Andy has his own fashion line to our set you can also catch him starring alongside Dwayne Johnson and Hobbes and Shaw which is set to theaters on August 2nd Idris although welcome to the show thank you so much man you forgot rapper also a rapper you didn't know well we'll get to that here in just a sec wait we don't have to but it just I know that you enjoy a side of hot sauce with your eggs and steak in Lemoore I actually do yes how do you think you'll fare today against the wings ah it sound pretty confident I'm pretty confident in his wife because I fear no one [Music] [Music] all right cool it's pretty decent all right look you know my mom west-african cooks with real spices and everything I was just four years old so you know I mean you have a good foundation there I have a good foundation yeah yeah so I want to start by mentioning Hobbs and Shawn specifically your interesting cars which I know goes much deeper than just the Fast & Furious franchise and in the film you drive this motorcycle that can do a little bit of everything are you into the cutting edge technology and gadgets that are showing up in cars these days are you more of an old-school Motorhead man I sort of I'm course you know in between the two cuz I really really like a chill head I like the smell of old leather I love the smell you know gasoline go into the thing but what's happening with the innovation of cars and technology is incredible I mean we are becoming one with our cars you know you can open your car with your phone you can turn your AC on before you get any of the engine the bike is you remember like Knight Rider right a bit like kit and old David happen so it has like an extension of you you saw that right and David Hasselhoff had a decent leather jacket I went for that look as well so as a lifelong hip hop obsessive where did recording the intro to jay-z's American Gangster rank in terms of your career accomplishments um it's up there in top five really wrote oh yeah because um I have always had this hybrid dream of being an actor and a musician and that my music of my films lived together in one way of one world and here I was in an American Gangster and I'm making this film with Denzel it was a moment in my life and then I hear from Ridley Scott himself jay-z's gonna do an album why I gotta be on that album I said in my brain not to Ridley but to myself I'm gonna be on the album and so the next thing you know I'm sending jay-z this poem I rip my retinas poem this sonnet I worked with a good friend of mine an angel and she and I have pulled together this poem report this beat together from a boy Chris flame and we went in send it to jay-z like this this hope he likes it when you sent me an email back back saying I don't like it I [ __ ] love it it's gonna be on the intro of American Gangster and that was the beginning of the dream bro that was the beginning like you know dream big it can happen for you and then I'm the topic of rap music hot ones creator Chris Schoenberger he's obsessed with that Kino song road man's him which actually references you cuz I think you guys are from the same neighborhood Charlotte okay no he's he's a legend in in UK hip-hop scene a big uptick in oh yeah so for our viewers who are maybe not familiar with British hip-hop can you give us your top 5 Dead or Alive UK Edition okay I'm gonna say no particular order demon boys which some of you would not know but I was one of the first rap groups that I fell in love of in England I'm gonna put black twang on there I'm gonna put the London posse on there I'm gonna have to put storm Z on there I have to put dizzy on there I'm gonna have to put gigs on there I mean I know that six and I can count but it's just you know in terms of UK hip hop right we have to remember is that for a long time we emulated them at America we emulated them we even wrapped in American accents just because we 40 was cool LA and we didn't think our music would be accepted and now we don't even listen to my own rap music as much you know we have our own labels we have our own stars and it feels very good very healthy [Music] was it light with no heavy man what was he doing what's all you sweat so in 2017 you released a documentary that followed your year-long journey training for eventually competing and winning your kickboxing professional debut and maybe this sounds like a bizarre question but when you knock someone out the water slurp huh it's a technique sucka talk about engines like a cooling technique Oh got slep it in an IRA to them innovative when you knock someone out is it just a pure thrill of victory feeling or is there a part of you that's like concerned for the other person that's a great question because in my training the concern lives inspiring when you hit something really hard inspiring your concern for them you know because they're concerned for you they're letting you know when they hit you that I got you keep your arm up keep your ribs covered or whatever but when you're in a fight situation and I did not notice I've never been a professional fire into that moment there is no concern for each other he came out to take my head off and he felt I was 43 at the time like this guy was way younger than me he was gonna beat me but wasn't having that so there's no room for concern is the short answer you just have to go in there and it's like man against man you know Dwayne Johnson gives you one free shot where and how do you hit him if I had to hit Dwayne one time and and no disrespect Wayne I love you pal but I'm going for your neck Yeah right in there bro because like you know I just at least if you get up from it you be winded and I would have reached halfway down the block by that sound shortly I'm going for the neck okay very strategic all right you're ready to move on a four lucky dog year of the dog oh yeah [Music] well I have to tell you I expected some real competition and these homes will remember we'll remember it just say this [Laughter] last time I was in London was in 2017 and I got a crash course in British slang from Charlie slots so here I'm hoping you can take me to finishing school but first things first okay can you explain what cockney rhyming slang is they come from your neck of the woods so company rhyming slang I have to give you a brief history in in in London history the cockneys are a community there are people you might have seen them they have these amazing pearl laced jackets there you know parade those are the companies and you can only be a cockney if you were born within the three-mile radius of a church called the bow church and it was called the bow bells because when the church rang you could hear the bells for three miles if it was outside of the three miles you could not be a cockney but if you could hear the bells of in the throughout it is you are technically a cockney now cockney rhyming slang was almost like code speak you know like you ever been to jail no meaning but irrelevant in jail they would say you know possibly the bloody blah to mean the bloody blood right and cockney rhyming slang did a similar sort of thing is kind of like you know I'm gonna go to the apples and pears and that would rhyme with stairs so you're going up the apples and pears stairs so you want to say to your boy I'm gonna be meet me at the apples and pears you don't want anyone else to know yes that's what that's what cockney rhyming slang is what is a crap when someone says a crap what's a crap a crap is the sneakers in a so shoes like you know you've got your crepes is that I don't know where it comes from I think it might be French derivative but it's your crap in it it's like yeah what do they mean when they say Bob's your uncle cuz I'm always like my uncle Steve I got another one name bro it's a confirmation that you're going down the right you know saying this like you know go down the road make a left you see the shop on your right Bob's your uncle it's there and it means it just means confirmation you're there what would you want idris elba to mean in cockney rhyming slang be more like I like that hey you know what I'm gonna do me LD Giselle what's it like no study on today mm-hmm no solos Carly on China you can Caliente no mass that's pretty good that's terrible that's well done all right so every Korean segment on our show called explain that grammar we do a deep dive under guess Instagram cool interesting pictures that need more context don't do that so I'll bust out the laptop I'll show you the picture and you just tell me the bigger story does that sound good really that's going down he's gonna dump all right I'm sweating over here though first things first here you are Tyrion we hey Arsenal legend who's your favorite gunner of all time favorite guna of all time has to be Ian right Ian right I love you tre you're my guy but Ian's right it was alleged you know he's uh he's from my neck of the woods just seeing him step into the awesome shirt killer as one of the greatest strikers asked was ever seen was like there is hope for all of us so yeah we got to Eni all right here you are getting a fit off what did his royal Birthday Ball in 2004 is that true that you met Diddy when you were 14 years old not 14 it was about 18 years old I was did he was doing these incredible and I have to say shout-out to Diddy for doing these he was doing these incredible talks as part of music seminars and we had this one music cinema seminar in London in Islington and this is just before the height of bad boy came alive and in rows in P Diddy and I got to ask him a question and everyone was like but this is Puff Daddy from America you know being small the whole lot and then as he was leaving everyone was standing up clapping and he came down the middle and I put my hand up and he missed me oh [ __ ] okay I love you did and that was the other day I know I know you expected the high-five it never came but however I was like this I missed him buddy he definitely saw me that was my G and then one more for you do you have a lasting memory from this party at Greenhouse Ti Drake and then of course Nipsey Hussle I met Drake that night and nipsey that night and I just remember they were you know Nick's he was a fan of the wire trick too and you know they were giving me mad love we were just in this group just lads having fun there's a couple more pictures from that series at a run they probably has but what was interesting about the wire is that I you know my character stringer Bell and Avon and we Bey you know we we captured the imagination of the rap stars we captured the rap the imagination of the hip-hop stars just because that was partly their journey most rappers had you know been on the streets at some point and the wire represented them so I was like you know grandfathered into the culture and and the rappers and I definitely had a you know until they heard me speak - oh I'm a go [ __ ] amazing y'all right you're like stringer what you know Kevin said I'm getting high I kind of get where he's going oh now we're talking okay know it says taste no evil I mean who puts that on on their marketing Hellfire Detroit failed to taste no evil this is good this is by far my favorite really favorite yeah uh-huh mm-hmm so in a 2010 New York Times profile you talked about being fascinated by the career of somebody like Daniel day-lewis who is able to have this viable huge career in acting while simultaneously maintaining a private life and since that time we've gotten further away from that version of a movie star do you have any thoughts on how celebrity is handled in the media like do you still yearn for that sense of privacy that's a great question because you know my career spans over a couple of decades I was talking to my publicist about this you know how the trends have changed you get you know we want to know more we want to know more you want to do we don't just want to do an interview we want to eat hot wings really you know we wanna and that is a sign of the times you know I mean I feel like and I have a theory behind it it may be controversial but reality TV changed the game because you don't have to watch an actor pretend to cry when you can watch real people cry in real life and then you start to see the difference between acting and reality when someone's prepared to bare their soul on TV why gonna watch an actor so that changed the game for all of us because they were like yeah he's so mysterious who cares I got someone over here who's bearing their soul out in their their real life and I get to know them they are my personality in real life is probably way more disappointing that my characters I get to play I play way more interesting characters than Who I am in real life however that said I don't miss the days where you could be mysterious I don't actually miss that I don't like the obsession with celebrity I think it's unhealthy it's unhealthy for a lot of reasons but if you're gonna everyone's gonna have a a camera on their phone you're going to expect an obsession with celebrity you're going to expect that people used to walk around with water graph books now they don't they want the picture [Music] good tasting what what okay mm-hmm are you as a plan put that one over there [Music] let me try that there you go you see ones an it's like a percolate it's like um it's like a cooling system cooling it down just some swollen so I know that getting the role of string of bow on the wire it was a huge break in your career and then of course that show is aged so well constantly topping lists of the best TV shows ever made is it true that David Simon didn't know that you have an accent when you were cast yeah we love it it's cool so David Simon specifically told Alexa Fogel who is the casting director listen this is about Baltimore well see no non-americans for any of these roles I need people that can really relate to the story I'm trying to tell here which is a very fair thing to ask for considering how observant he is of the culture so Alexa foger was a casting director that was really into seeing new talent and she met me and she said I love you I kind of bring you into this audition but then promise me you can tell them you from East London I'm like what that walk in there you got to talk with your accent you live in Brooklyn right you got sit in the barbershop talk all day I was like okay so my first audition I walked in there and I had to just pretend she's outside the doors like remember hey Harry years into Shelby Lane Jenna I set it in I did my first edition and David Sanger was among great great I still one more time into seven ever go and then the fourth audition they changed the tactics on me because by this point I was good with the accent like boom I was walking in and I go what up David what up man what's good nearly old is that yeah great and the Irishman so I talk to me goes hey address I talked to her about your life huh yeah yeah just talk to me so waiver now this is the moment of truth because my parents told me not to lie you know I mean you look someone in the eye and be honest I have lied it's never worked out for me so I was looking at this guy thinking yeah girl you know I'm not from Brooklyn don't us we were from just ask me to read the lines and we could get out of here and he was Irish so I could tell ya this twinkle in his eye he's like no come on brother boyfriend and I said listen mate I'm from London bro I'm born and raised in East London yeah I would Alexa done don't fire Alexa but she told me not to tell you guys and he jumped over and I knew it I blew it David I knew it dad was like wow okay and true story he said you know we just want to give you the job I'm nearly burst into tears because it was a tough time for me at times and he said I'm not gonna give you every one but I think he could play string a bell and he told me why and that was it it's amazing true story [Music] Oh was being the top scorer for the under nine scanning town football club your first brush with greatness well okay let me just get this straight the out can in town under nine sting that was a joke that wasn't real I just said that for the commercial you talk about the I detest commercial were to ask the new shots I said what you're trying to do did taking the 2017 title for britain's rear of the year have any tangible effect on your life [ __ ] showed up and I didn't even know I was nominated they made me a bit interested today who fun is looking at my ass to

York being on SNL and being a host it was incredible alright address okay bro are you ready to move on no I mean yeah like I said man I am gonna be the hottest hottest hot one ain't I scared of nothing with nobody you know what I tell my children is he Winston we as I scared of nobody nothing let me ask you a question funny sure sure let me ask you a question uh whose idea was this show so you see that guy right there and the blue shirt yeah his named Chris what's in it Chris right can you fight Chris you might have to but you have to talk about this we already have a bright ideas coming up in your little brain box over there Jesus claim about to pass out so when you're not doing summer blockbusters or doing cult TV shows like Luther I know that you're a globe-trotting DJ who it's everyplace from Coachella to Ibiza and your roots behind the turntables they go really deep can you explain the pirate radio scene for those who are unfamiliar yeah absolutely the pirate radio scene really started off somewhere in the 70s I want to say 70s early 80s there was a radio station called Caroline radio which was like this radio station that pitched up on a ship why they did that is because they found that it could hijack a frequency and the people that control that basically couldn't find him because it wasn't about and they were like who is this station Radio Caroline it killed it it started a trend cut to the mid eighties early nineties it was all the rage especially for urban music for black music where we want to talk about our neighborhood we want to talk about things that we see every day excuse me I just spat all over your it's okay we're in this together let me Debbie damage your swing over there boy thank you I worked on pirate radio for about two years

feNbGXiHgdg,LGR,VideoGames,LGR - The Sims 3 Supernatural Review,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feNbGXiHgdg,9 years ago,1.7M views,VideoGames,"[typing] When I play The Sims 3, I'm normally
looking to emulate real life, more or less. You know, play with the natural order
of things and see what happens. But it's inevitable that before long,
someone gets the idea to take the natural and make it far-more super. While I personally prefer my spooks spooked, goblins gobbled, UFOs KOed, aliens alienated, vampires evaporated and monsters
remonstrated, it doesn't matter because now we've got The Sims 3 Supernatural! The seventh expansion pack for The Sims 3. ""Embrace the Supernatural"" with just about every horror story cliche imaginable, yet with that trademark Sims twist. This is not the expansion droid I'm looking for. But here it is in my hands, so I may as well drop the disc in and see what I get. Supernatural starts off with a not-so-
super-looking loading screen that–whoa! The moon! Uhh, more moon! MORE moon! Full moon. After the loading screen finishes mooning you, you're taken to the the moon menu– er, main menu... to select an old game or start a new one. Starting a new one gives you a chance
to try out the new town with Supernatural, Moonlight Falls. In this town, the moonlight continually falls and is never once even tempted to rise. It's not quite Mystic Falls, Virginia, but it still has an appropriately foggy, murky, small town Americana look that fits
the whole naturally super vibe going on. There is a metric crap-ton of new junk in this pack. But the main attraction is the new set of life states: In fact, if you want to jump
right into many of these, you can do so with Create a Sim. All of the new ones, minus zombies, can be chosen, as well as two old ones: ghosts and genies. This makes it easier to play as these beings, since you don't have to go out
of your way to get turned into one through normal gameplay anymore. You can also apply 12 new skin tones, adjust things like ear pointiness and fingernails, as well as choose a completely
separate look for turned werewolves, essentially letting you have two Sims in one. You can only choose one life
state at a time here, though, so forget any plans you may have for creating a zombie-fairy-
werewolf-genie-man-bear-pig. May as well cover the dickload of new
clothing and hair items since we're here. Seriously, there's a lot. Ten new tattoos, nine new
accessories, two new facial hairs, 24 new hairstyles and 86 new outfits – from children to elders – way too much to show here,
so I'm not even going to try. Granted, most of this fits in with that whole
gothic, supernatural, Addams Family-esque theme, so don't expect to see summer
dresses and Speedos here. You also get some new traits, like Night Owl, Supernatural Skeptic, and Supernatural Fan. And no, that has nothing to do with whether
or not you like Sam and Dean Winchester. Enough of that, on with the life states, with the first one being vampires. Now you may be thinking: What the cow? Weren't there vampires in the Late Night expansion? Yes, questioner of the bovine. You are correct! And if you didn't have Late Night, you'll have them now. They can perform all the same hunting,
plasma-sucking, sunlight-avoiding, Usain Bolt-ing actions from Late Night, but they have a few new additions. Now vampires can apply vampiric sunblock so they don't fall apart in the sun, which almost makes being a vampire
completely devoid of drawbacks. Blood-suckers also have the ability to
hypnotically gaze into the eyes of Sims, admit to or deny their vampiric existence, and intimidate and exploit 
weaknesses of lesser Sims. So, yeah, they're definitely a step up from Late Night, although most of their day-to-day
life will remain the same. They can also receive the Immortal Lifetime award, which of course means they'll never age or die. Although, this also causes
them to sparkle in the sunlight. [groans] You just had to do it, didn't you, SimStudio? I thanked you guys for having some taste and leaving out sparkly
vampires from Late Night, and now this. What's next, brooding over underage
girls and long walks in the woods? The only way to atone for this is to
create a Blade Sim for the next expansion. Just makin' that clear. Enough of the unfortunate sparkles.
Next up, we have zombies. Although you can't make these guys from scratch, existing adult Sims can become
a zombie by being bitten by one. All it takes is one infected bite
and before you know it, you'll have an epidemic of walkers on your hands. Another way to become a zombie is
to make use of a zombification elixir. These are brewed by anyone with high enough
alchemy skill, but we'll get to that later. Once you are a zombie, you can
shuffle around and snarl at people, and if you're lucky, you might get
a tasty chunk of live Sim flesh. Might want to stop by the Sweet Treats
House of Pain while you're at it. There's plenty of candies Sim flesh in there, though it might be a bit charred. So yeah, being a zombie isn't that great,
and it wears off over time. So you can see why you're not
allowed to create your own zombie Sim, since it's about as permanent
as a Kardashian marriage. Well, at least under typical circumstances, since zombies created by a potent
zombie elixir or reanimation ritual will remain zombified until
hit with a cure of some kind, like stronger elixirs and fairy dust. However, another element to
consider are zombie invasions. Remember that lunar loading screen? Turns out the moon is a big addition to Supernatural, and now you have lunar cycles to keep up with. You can either just look at this
icon near your Sim's portrait, or buy a lunar dial to check the lunar state and read your lunar horoscope. When it's a full moon,
all sorts of craziness happens, supernatural creatures go on high alert, and zombies will start attacking your home. Well, less attacking, more sauntering by
and messing around with your stuff a bit. They'll also eat plants, so if you have an outdoor garden, well that sucks. And, yeah, you heard that right.
There's a zombie on your lawn, eating plants. Hey, EA owns PopCap Games now, so why not? Actually, there's even a set of Plants vs. Zombies
content in the limited edition of Supernatural, including a working pea shooter plant. Plop this little guy onto your
yard for some home defense, where it will eventually remove zombification
from a Sim if it hits one with enough peas. You can also play catch with the little guys, which, I must admit, is oddly endearing. The next life state is the fairy. And obviously the most notable
difference from normal Sims is the fact that they've got
magical freaking wings. On their back. You can't exactly go flying
all over the place with these, but you can hover a bit. Kind of like having a weak jetpack. Another big edition is the magic meter for fairies, right below the lunar cycle meter. You can use your fairy magic to perform all sorts of weird little stunts. Like playing slightly evil tricks on other Sims, and transforming into a
shrunken sprite form to pester Sims by tinkering with their bells or something. You can also cast auras, which affect the skills and mood of
Sims around you for both good and bad. Fairies are also great at creative endeavors
like painting, writing and sculpting. They age slower than regular Sims, and they're also awesome gardeners and can even help plants magically grow faster. They'll eventually run out of
their magical magic juice, though, so you're stuck either waiting for it to regenerate or looking for a magic replenishment elixir. You can also find fairies hanging
around in little fairy houses, usually located in gardens, like the ones located at the
new Arboretum community lot. Though you can also just buy
your own and use it at home, as sort of a home away from home... at home... homie. The fairies are also able to level up their
magical abilities the more they use them, so there's quite a bit to do with these guys if you can deal with the omnipresent,
constantly flapping, neon raver wings. Though I've heard you can just get
rid of them, but that just seems mean. Witches are next on the menu, and these are exactly what one would expect. You burn through 'em and
slam in the back of my Dragula. Both dudes and chicks aged
teen to elder can become witches, and these are essentially occultist magicians. Their big draw is the ability to learn and cast spells, either with magic wands or with their hands once they're good enough. You'll start with a basic wand and skill level and with enough practice and money, you can progress to wandier wands and magic...ier magic. Like fairies, witches have a
magic meter to keep up with, and performing both good and bad
spells with deplete this magic. And it's pretty cool when
witches meet up with each other, since then a witch duel may occur. It's rarely ever deadly, and it's a cool way to test out spells and see who's the wickedest witch of the wherever. They also have the ability to ride brooms, both on the road in place of a normal vehicle or in a broom area that's totally not Quidditch. Nope. Though I sometimes prefer to
have my witches use a bicycle when riding through Kansas. Just add the threat of getting pretties and little dogs, and we're set for one ""Oz-some"" time. Another huge thing to screw with is alchemy. Though not exclusive to witches,
they do it better than anyone else. This is pretty much like the chemical
table from the Generations expansion, just with a more magical slant. You can concoct all sorts of elixirs, from those that help to those that hurt. From skill-boosting potions to instant obesity. It's awesome to throw these evil
things at Sims and watch them squirm. Or mix it into their drink if you want
to go for a more covert approach. Alchemy also feeds into the
existing collectibles mechanic, since many of these potions require weird items. There are a bunch of new items
along with the existing collectibles, so it's nice that they've added a collectibles
journal to keep up with everything. You can also just forgo a lot of the searching by checking out the alchemy store community lot. Though it's expensive and they don't have everything, so chances are you'll still have to
roll your own for the best potions. Finally, the final live state with...
finality... is the werewolf. Whether you create a Jake team member yourself or become one by getting bitten or using a potion, werewolves are pretty friggin' rad. Well, they could be more rad with a
Michael J. Fox edition, but I digress. Sims with lycanthropic tendencies can transform into a werewolf at any time, but they're at the top of their
game during a full moon. I think it's a bit unfortunate that you can't go on
a classic werewolf rampage through the town, so instead you're left with
the familiar parody creature you may be used to from previous Sims games. But hey, at least you can... scratch the couch. That's... that's cool... You can also howl at the moon, more or less. Which doesn't do much of anything it seems, except let people know that you're loud. [howling] [coughing] In fact, werewolves can't do
much of anything special at all. I mean, sure, you can run around trying to
bite people and turning them into werewolves, but what's the point? You're effectively a glorified dog
wandering around acting silly. And you can form packs of
werewolves if you want to, but again, what's the point?
You can't go around being evil. And I've seen Robin Williams impersonators that are hairier and scarier than these guys. You know, really, just forget that I said they were rad. These are probably the lamest of the
playable life states, in my opinion, because of all the lost potential. The only real use I've found for the werewolf is being sort of a companion to the witch, since they can hunt out rare collectibles, but, yeah, you can do that on your own,
it's just maybe not as effective. Werewolves are normally awesome because they're unpredictable
and blood-thirsty monsters. These... aren't. Someone turns out to be a werewolf, who cares? Just keep him away from the sofa and smack it with a rolled up
newspaper every so often; you're cool. And that's all of the life states, but frick, there's so much more. Another big addition is the return of the Bone Hilda
skeletal maid from The Sims: Makin' Magic. Just buy her coffin and
let her loose into your house to clean up the werewolf
droppings and spilled fairy dust. There's also a sweet, sliding bookcase door that fits in nicely with the rest of
the Haunted Mansion-style decor. Eh, it's just a door. It acts like a door. It's a door. But it looks like a bookcase, and that's awesome. Fitting in with the witch's lair is the magic mirror. Though it's not on the wall, it's on the floor, which totally screws up the rhyme, so whoever came up with that idea can suck it. You've also got a whack-a-mole machine, as well as a claw machine, called ""The Claaaaaw!"" Yes, I'm serious, so go-go gadget Pixar lawyers. This one's ripe. There's also a couple cool things
I've always kinda sorta wanted at certain times of day on Tuesdays. Like grandfather clocks and rocking chairs. You also get beehives. For keeping bees. In hives. Handy-dandy stuff if you fancy ingesting bee barf, or if you need things like honeycomb
and bees for concocting elixirs. There's also a gypsy caravan that you can visit, which not only lets you get your fortune told but allows you to enter into the fortune teller career. Oh, a career based on ripping people off
and overcharging for useless stuff. Heh-heh. I found the favorite job of the person who
came up with Katy Perry Sweet Treats. Throw in even more stuff like a new
Dark Wave music type, stone skipping, player-to-player gifting,
monsters under children's beds, a bush that grows potentially lethal jelly beans, being transformed into a toad, flying vacuum cleaners and more, and you've got a seriously beefy expansion pack. [sighs] So, is The Sims 3 Supernatural worth buying or not? Well, like always, the suggested retail price is $40 USD. And for as much paranormal playtime
as you get here, that's not a bad deal. But here's the thing to consider: do you want horror fantasy in your Sims 3 game? Personally, I kind of *don't.* Yeah, yeah, it's nice for a quick
distraction from the same old routine, and I'd have no issue with it being a standalone game. But plant-eating zombies and sparkling vampires are not why I play The Sims 3. I want to play with life, not the undead. Sure, you can disable the supernatural creatures
and lunar cycle and all that in the options menu, which I must commend the developers for including. But, really, if you're going to disable all this stuff, why have the expansion at all? It's for this reason that I personally cannot
whole-heartedly recommend Supernatural to any and every Sims player. Yes, it's a very well-made pack with a ton of content. But a large chunk of that content pertains to stuff that's ripped straight out of the
playbook of old monster movies and doesn't do much at all to
expand the classic Sims formula, which is what I look for in an expansion pack. And disregarding that, due to its Teen
rating it plays it safe with the horror and ends up as a watered-down,
family-friendly experience. It's got all the terror and frightening monster
imagery as Bobby Pickett's ""Monster Mash."" Not that I was expecting loads of gore or anything, but, you know, more dire consequences for
crossing these supernaturals would be welcome. But that's probably beside the point for a lot of people, And if you want a bunch of supernatural
creatures roaming throughout your towns, this is the expansion for you and
I don't think you'll be disappointed. It's packed to the brim full of very well-made content, and that's how an expansion *should* be. Well, if you're into this kind of expansion.",14:55

don't scare what if i built up tension like i was going to do another jump scare but then i didn't but then i did i have jump scared you i will wait here so that i can do my ultimate spooking [Applause] and then i'll just load some of these halloween themed bullets all this and more on i don't know if you especially want to talk about your phobias because i kind of don't i don't like moths moths kind of suck yeah it's not that i'm afraid of moths it's that i know what they're like and what's gonna happen is if i try to live and let live with a moth in the room you're gonna bump into the light bulb for a while and then you're gonna find a way to get down the back of my shirt i just don't want to have it so i go out of my way to kill moths being a personality online last thing you want is to be like oh i'm terrified of beautiful woman's breasts and then know you wake up next day with 500 beams be like look at this which by the way is my phobia i don't find butterflies to be very beautiful either they're just larvae with wings yeah but i'm real i i guess you could classify ghosts as a phobia why are all ghosts from like the 1800s how come you never just see some guy who died like two weeks ago wearing like a gucci shirt or something oh i've seen modern ghosts what in real life in movies and stuff okay usually it's like just after the accident though so you know sixth sense oh yeah there's this scene with a bike crash and it's like the moment that the mum starts to believe and she goes you know how do you know that like with tears in his eyes she's standing beside my window but then it's just this extra with no lines yeah and so it's kind of standing there with like a bloodied up head but then it goes what's my cue and it just sort of walks away and it's very like nonchalant it is so funny it's funny right it's not just me it's this really well done dramatic moment she just kind of feels a bit awkward she's like uh i'll come back later i do think that that is a potential market that has not been tapped airbnbs that are gimmick haunted it's okay so some of the cabinets the hinges are you know installed a certain way so that they like naturally swing open more than they should stuff like that [ __ ] that would be awesome actuators that like open up doors later exactly and you know and then you've got like a story to go home with why the hell isn't that a thing okay let's say you've booked in the airbnb and you're on your way there yeah it's like this one dirt road and so they've hired a guy steve you gotta get out there you're this old british man with the flat king you're playing the role of the harbinger in case you don't know what a harbinger is here's the scene from cabin in the woods i've seen plenty come and go getting back that's your conservative you don't stand in the old cabin down the way i uh some say it's haunted ah it was eight score years ago the old brown family they they perished in a terrible fire they say they're holding the grounds ever since you might be wondering why the house seems old if it caught on fire don't think about their time it's made of asbestos you see would you know that asbestos was actually stop it stop it stop talking about this pistol it's going to get back onto the yeah it's got a little earpiece ah they say that no airbnb customers ever make it up live oh i know what you got you go you know the whole house is yours you know feel free to enjoy it but there is one rule do not open the door to the basement oh yeah that's good and then that stays locked until like 11 p.m and then it just unlocks itself have a door that unlocked i would slam it shut and put a chair up against it you have to make a reason for them to go down there so it would be something like like a child's voice there's a bluetooth down there as well excuse me hello oh they said that's good i get would you even try and sleep if you like paid money to stay at somewhere creep like that i guess you would maybe maybe not you might end up with just a bunch of drunk people are going [ __ ] you yeah there's probably a bluetooth speaker there's like a fake child doll i like punch it break it there's a lot of setup that's involved to like suspend the display what i was thinking was the power cuts out or or something along the way oh that's good i've got it the power goes out but they've given you a torch beforehand but they're uv torches and so when you turn them on there's like blood stains and [ __ ] all over the wall i had a messages yeah yeah if you sold it as an experience instead of as a it's an actual accommodation it would be brilliant because you get some business man it's just like i had the worst night's sleep zero starts [Music] have you seen the saw movies i haven't but i've watched

houses but it was probably like one in ten houses actually did it yeah nothing like american uh halloween people didn't really try we went to two of them and they were like no [ __ ] off we're like all right i think one woman gave us 50 cents it wasn't very good my experience is that halloween i think was my favorite holiday of anything really way better than christmas or my birthday because you get to dress up which is like fun in the first place i'm going to go as an arabian night and put on black face and i'm going as justin trudeau so halloween is great because you have absolutely no idea what's going to happen and it's one of the first times where you get to go out on your own you can do slightly criminal things and get away with it it's brilliant one time i think i was a ninja yeah you know fortnite ninja blevins yeah yeah that's me and a couple of mates we're walking around and every second house is not doing halloween yeah but they would see you dressed up and it's like hold on because just let me um see what's in the pantry they would come out with like a whole packet of tim tams oh hell yeah like that's a whole it's like fantastic and then once in a while they would be like oh you know what i'm not doing candy you can have something healthy and you get vegetables oh yeah i got an apple once that was the worst bro i got a full cabbage it was three and a half kilos it was enormous it was like oh this is our new [ __ ] treasure for the evening we're walking along the streets some teenagers in a car see us with this big cabbage and they're like roll it roll it and so they got us to roll it onto the street and then they're in their car right and so they would just like go forward and back and try to run over the cabbage and we were just having the [ __ ] oh it's just the best man and then you get home and then there's just a whole bunch of candy i love the idea of you having to like diablo style inventory manage your bag with a cabbage that's just taking up like 12 slots and you're like wow can't get rid of it halloween i was dressed as super mario you're going as chris pratt yeah i was a crisp rat so i was like 16 17. we were drinking grape juice because i was underage we were like let's go to mcdonald's as all good stories end on a night of debauchery right it was probably like a 15-minute walk not too far away side note the entire way one of my friends was like put his arms around me james bro i [ __ ] love you man just so you know i've always got your [ __ ] back if anything [ __ ] happens so we pulled up to an intersection and a car pulled up and this dude who had been trying to finger me a second ago was like hey g'day boys you're having a good night guy gets out of the passenger side this dude's like in his late 20s eyes us all up sees i'm the smallest yeah right all i remember is being up and then i remember being sideways holy [ __ ] and uh he had cracked me in my jaw holy [ __ ] he could have turned you into a ghost you'd hear about people who just ding their head off the concrete and they're done yeah so i mean maybe i am dead healing shall osman's there you look outside the window and i just walk away kind of nonchalantly so i get smacked i'm on the ground yeah i didn't pass out i just got a walloping and he got back in his car and they peeled off up the street yeah conveniently a police cruiser pulls up so they didn't see any of that happen but all my friends are like go get that [ __ ] car they just punched my friend cops peel off up the road after them you know pull them over and then they come back to us and they're like yeah they say that uh they didn't do anything and then they like see me on the ground like bleeding well they obviously did something yeah ended up taking the guy to court you took him to court i did and he he played not guilty so what did you say i i hereby declare your honor this guy did a mischief to my face take a look at my mug one woman screams and she's like he's disgusting it's just my normal face oh and his speech impediment ever since all right so what happened then did he go to jail he plead not guilty and i gave my statement he said that my attire was offensive to him keep in mind dressed as mario from the video game mario yeah did you get punched by [ __ ] while louis now they think about it it wasn't a car it was a cart they were in and they drove off onto like a big rainbow road in the sky so what happened did he go to jail so he played not guilty and then i think he was from up north so he went back to like whatever town he was from and and was being trialled in their court and while he was awaiting his court date he assaulted someone else so mild brain damage i suppose yeah well i started a youtube channel so [Music] oh we should do like a really dumb creepypasta like a video game we both know oh that would be quite good okay guys you'll never believe this story but it's a hundred percent when i was 14 years old i really wanted to play the new game fallout 4 but my parents wouldn't buy it for me so one day i went to a garage sale lo and behold there was a copy of fallout 4 but the disc was just an ordinary disc and someone had just written fo4 on it in a marker pen it must have been a pirated copy i wish i had known what i know now that is not or any ordinary copy of fallout 4 when i installed the game it came with a warning that said may cause death i thought it was the developers trying to be funny holy [ __ ] this is every game creepypasta this is very accurate when i booted up the game it wouldn't work properly it would be a black screen but then i messed around with the system files and i managed to get it working i thought it was just my pc acting up because my mom wouldn't let me buy a new graphics card the first thing i noticed was that there was already a save file on the game i thought that was strange i opened it up and it took me to the character creation menu except the man standing in front of the mirror was dead can i tell you something my wall just creaked and i got a fry cause you were putting me on edge genuinely got scared by that after i picked up my baby the screen went black and and i figured once again maybe my old pc had bugged out but all of a sudden it skipped to what seemed like a few hours in the game i was back in the wasteland and i was talking to what's named guys i was talking to preston garby the only option it gave me was strangle so i pressed the button and what happened next was an extremely graphic cut scene of my character cutting the circulation to preston gabi he screamed in pain and it wasn't like any of the usual voice acting this sounded real i swear when i looked into his eyes it was like the textures suddenly got hyper-realistic and i thought i saw a reflection of a person in it i thought i saw myself not only that but the familiar fallout ui went from being nuclear green to blood red and then it goes i've been playing this game for a long time now and i've started to notice some things i feel like there's shadows in the corner of my room in real life i played for another 20 hours literally exploring every cracking crevice until finally i found the first npc i'd seen in a literal day it was my dead wife and she was still frozen like she was in the cryo chamber i started doing some research on the dark web i found a post that said that actually during the production of fallout 4. one of the beta testers was forced to play the game for 20 hours straight to see if there was any bugs with the game being played for 20 hours straight and the man died of dehydration and then todd howard buried the body and he didn't want anyone to know something is not right i feel like there's creatures all around me like in the game i can see map markers in the distance here's the worst part i decided to webcam my friend but when i opened the call he said why are you hanging out with preston garby and i said what i'm all alone i've got another twist an ultimate to my shock when the webcam turned on it wasn't my friend as i expected it was the todd howard staring back at me but his eyes were different they were more evil his eyes were black and as though he'd been crying blood he opened his mouth and only static came out i was terrified of what would happen it threw the static though i could hear something he said if you die in the game you die in real life finish the game i hope this isn't my last entry things are getting really bad now i went back to that neighbor's garage sale and it turns out they've never even lived there if i can end on one thing it's to say this if you find a pirated game at a garage sale don't play that's a great one okay [Laughter],25:05
VXtVrNdD3YA,Markiplier,VideoGames,Five Nights at Freddy's 'Not-So-Official' Ending - Part 3,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXtVrNdD3YA,7 years ago,31M views,VideoGames,hello everybody my name is markiplier and welcome back to five nights at Freddy's now I am going to attempt to beat this game right now and I have a strategy to do it now I have kind of figured this out already but you don't actually need to watch where they are throughout the entire building considering that they can just jump behind your door at any time so the most important thing to do is this check outside your door with the lights and check on Pirates Cove very frequently because this [ __ ] over here it doesn't even know what he's doing so how is he gonna give me advice when he's already stuffed into a freaking box [Music] hi balls no no no oh yeah no no no no no no no you do nothing okay so god damn it it's like I forget how bad it is and then I get in here and then it's just horrifying so either way so I got a pretty solid strategy to go about this cuz it doesn't even matter when my time spent finding him is just time wasting power why my spy oh I don't do that to me Tom as well just spend my resources very quickly checking frequently distributing everything was seen very closely to the random noises that are playing in my ear and not worrying about anything thinking about like bunny rabbits or something [Music] I'm checking a little too frequently but I want to just be very careful here because if one of them does end up popping out behind my door I need to know about it okay so all right you sons a [ __ ] word I'm settled in for a long night don't even think that you're gonna sneak up on me why do I have to go through six hours and s crap why did I come back for another night it's not like I signed a Blood Pact to come back here every single night it's like four bucks an hour people actually worked out I'm here tonight for four bucks an hour I'm watching bad okay that's guys down watch fire Cove what's that for ducky wait till he's gone okay okay he's still there okay hold on Zach still there good good good at least I have company for my nightmare good yeah I feel choked up spit hippie out already I gotta keep a closer eye on him he can't be out already laughs dear oh I barely even missed him oh I gotta hear ye forget it do I even get to hear footsteps before they get here yeah yeah no no this is keys all right it's okay but I'm gonna use to it it ain't so bad anymore except that it's horri [ __ ] no no no no no you can't be sneaking out there right now I've got my eye on you so hard no no no Who am I supposed to check you how often am I supposed to check him no oh I gotta be even more classic Sevilla if I see you even for a goddamn second on it their flavor that door down so quickly someone's in the kitchen no don't even think about it this is my pattern there's my pattern for the end of days yeah pirate old man tired Eman whatever he is I don't even know I think he's coyote but I'm not entirely sure but I don't want to know anymore because I want to just get through this night and spa to get through this night having lights on it's my pattern so my days are done it's got to make sure hire Cole man evenly for a goddamn second I'm gonna lose my goddamn I'd owe you dummy are you gonna be say you gonna be with this dumbass game god I

__ ] here we go no no no who's the gentleman Oh goddammit were you out I'm singing so much so apparently mr. fuzzy Lumpkins likes to hang outside the door right towards the end of the night and kill me dead I don't appreciate that god damn why is the night so goddamn long don't much care for you don't appreciate who do that don't do the fast steps on me god I can't take the fast steps no fuzzy bear if you're freaking there I'm gonna kill you I stuff in you out of your suit as soon as he leaves oh I gotta be ready to roll reaction so fast like Mongoose weird weird do that Master Joe

you're so dead [Music] [Music] okay so I can be a little bit more conservative about checking especially pirate Cove because he'll reset if I catch him in time not to kill me all I need to do is check it periodically he'll be side nothing-- coal burner my brains out then they need to watch the doors outside [Music] I'll be fine I'm gonna be totally fine calm and collected I'm literally sweating right now no no no no they're doing their friend are you doing their weirdo friend new dum-dum [ __ ] you go away any candy for you mister trick-or-treater I just fine gonna be fine cuz I know the

look back back back he's there so he's about to pop up god dammit go away go away your ducky bastard you didn't bother me any other time why are you bothering me now anymore nothing he's not there it's all in my mind you're still there cuz you're not in my mind you're probably gonna kill me soon but hey it's gonna be okay for me I'm so dead I'm gonna run out of power at this point if you don't go up thank goodness oh I gotta keep the door down now because Lizzie's gonna come by Lisa's very cold man's I bother with my right door today dum-dum-dum you're a da da dum dum you're a dummy dumb

know if I have to call his editor you know what I'm gonna test something I'm not opening come on baby bro Ron what are you God open up the floodgates come on bring it on don't please [Music] [Music] I'm gonna guess then I'm not supposed to keep the door down when he's there cuz that wastes too much power there's no way it can be the if if I'm if I got the door down the entire goddamn time that he's there I'd be screwed [Music] really sorry if this may seem boring to some people but goddamn I really got nothing else to say and I want to beat this so bad so I'm just gonna focus on this until

freddy's well guess what that's just gonna have to wait for another episode because I literally couldn't have cut that last night closer than I did so I'm lucky enough to have won it when I did I'm very happy and I will save whatever the hell is in the 6th night for another episode you're just gonna have to wait on that one till I can play it again video way oh my god this is easily easily the scariest game I've ever played but unfortunately after a while if you playing it for like a few hours it does grow a little old on ya but it's amazing how the tension is still there it's a fantastic horror game it plays on every one of your paranoid delusions paranoia not paranoid but either way it's so good oh I don't know how they're gonna expand on the concept but either way they are awesome whoever made the scott cawthon you're awesome so thank you all so much for watching prepare for the 6th night later on and I hope you all enjoyed this so far thank you all so much for watching and as always in the [Music] [Music] your mama baby laboratory happened indicate the influent a very elaborate lie on my throat or right Apple you will be made like you to memory over though for you the joy

wTziIhu8yvU,Incognito Mode,"Blog,Comedy",etiquette.,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTziIhu8yvU,,4M views,"Blog,Comedy",etiquette etiquette what is etiquette warty lady fellowship is pinkies out good etiquette no wrong fork mr blackwell is it proper etiquette to eat eminem's with a spoon mr truckman you haven't touched your sandwich is it about holding the door for a woman for the last time mrs fairfax elbows off the table yes hello can't you see you interrupting our dining experience how rude all this and get cultured af on this episode of in the quarantine how rude does your waiter need to be before you feel the need to say something that's a good one right what if they spill a second glass of beverage on me first time it's an accident i don't think anybody would make that a problem they come back to get you your replacement soda they trip on the first drink that they spilled they haven't cleaned it up they just immediately went to get you another drink okay fumble it and i go i'm so sorry sir i cannot apologize enough that's two drinks that's unbelievable let me go and get you another would you let them get you a third drink at this point i think i would you think you would buy the third one i'll be standing up and going you'd be at the next table over like put it down step away it depends how apologetic they are after the second one i have to imagine they'd be [ __ ] bowing at that point so sorry i cannot imagine how this happens twice what i'm worried about is like so if he spills a drink third time but then he gets injured he's smacked his head on the table on the way down and so he's just lying unconscious on the floor yeah outside of the immediate knee-jerk reaction like you do you milk it at all do you immediately suck it up and be like hold on there's bigger stuff going on here yeah you have to suck it up but then what do you do if a second waiter comes out and goes oh my god this man's on the floor but then they trip over the body right and another drink and it just lands like right on your crotch right do you then say so i don't even think i would say something at that point it's still like well the guy's still on the floor is the second dude also hit his head on the way down that's the question because the second dude you can now be mad at there's no blame the sympathy shifted to him right right yep yeah at this point you could be like this dude's unconscious yeah two drinks though bro two drinks that's on you no one in the restaurant is enjoying their meal anymore everyone's just staring in our direction this pants are soaked through and through and then the manager comes out and goes where's my two waiters my two best men my two heavy left-footed waiters yeah oh my god looking at the two unconscious bodies and one of them has died yeah i didn't know if i wanted to go that serious but i feel like that's uh are you obliged to stick around nah no i feel like i'd leave immediate dude hits his head and he's not getting up off the ground i'm leaving i'm not following up with what this had nothing to do with me i don't want to deal with the police reports that are going to ask me if i witness something they've got cameras you guys can handle it you go home and um man this was such a terrible evening uh ring ring moshi moshi you don't know me but um i'm the wife of the waiter who served you this evening oh jessica robbins yes how's it going well not so good my husband is dead what i know and this may sound odd but would you come to the funeral [ __ ] now he was dedicated to serving people and i remember he said the very last person i serve on the job is the person i want to come to my funeral for the love of [ __ ] okay fine it would mean the world to me fine fine fine i'll consider it yeah all right i guess my concern would be that they're trying to murder me so you're at the wake what okay fine whatever you're at the lake and the wife comes up and she goes i swear to god if she asks me to speak at this thing no she comes up she goes hey thank you so much for coming here i brought you a drink what do you do do you say anything no no the no it's the same thing the first dude hit his head you know the sympathies on him at this point this girl must be getting you know [ __ ] flashbacks to how her husband just died no i'm not [ __ ] saying anything i'm helping her off the ground it's okay don't sweat it i brought extra shorts that's the thing i do now i'm also wearing shorts to a funeral for some reason i think that's kind of hot yeah i don't know i don't know what else to do i feel like i played that pretty well all right well i think we've taught people a valuable lesson so that's what you do if you ever get a drink spilled on you you know make an effort and attend the funeral yeah me and your mother we've um sumito we're uh we're going out to dinner you know you just uh you know entertain yourself there's hot dogs thawing in the sink it's hitting really close to home and we leave the driveway you can hear the car pulling away and then you put on titanic right and we've never seen titanic right anyway you're loving the movie it's great it's a great movie then it gets to the bit where jack and kate are having their romance and they're in the back of the old timey car and it's all steamy right oh well you know it was the uh the restaurant was closed because of the covert i can't believe we left the house samito what are you watching uh i guess one of two things i would either turn off the tv uh and just pretend to be passed out no no we've we've like no no i get that no no i get that that's still what i would do what what so we've busted through the door we've seen you we've seen you with your eyes open watching the movie and then you would just close your eyes and turn off the television i've been asleep i haven't been watching tv for an hour i fell asleep an hour ago either that like what the [ __ ] else are you gonna do you know what i mean my parents are muslim that would have been like a very big deal i imagine no but you were like actively watching the movie right we came in and we like saw you with your eyes open right no i i get that i'm saying i would still pretend to be asleep you would still pretend to be asleep just sitting up i think that would be my gut reaction if i had never been caught with anything and i was like really young like nine or ten yeah what did you do was getting away with something would you make the snoring noises no hell no well i snore that's the thing but i guess yeah either that would be like i just or maybe not pretend to be asleep but maybe pretend i've just woken up and gone ah the tv's been on i have no idea what this was i was you guys want something look we're not buying that you're asleep why were you watching this movie why were you watching this this looks like an adult film there are six scenes in here what is this what are you watching i i would tell them i thought it was an action movie what kind of i can see some action there's plenty of action in this movie samito right before this i swear james bond was on they were shooting each other this must be a scene in the movie i have no idea if it's on the tv that's the thing if you get caught on the computer it's different because you're not just watching titanic on the computer you pulled up that adult film that's happened exactly once and i told my dad it was a pop-up and i need to update my antivirus people are tend to be like oh one at a time when you get the trolley it'll be rude to sort of push forward but you could right you get your trolley and technically you could fill your trolley with stuff and then just go i'm done shopping yeah and leave like that's not stealing that's just moving [ __ ] around it is and you could like look in other people's trolleys just stare at it and and kind of go oh that's interesting shopping and then maybe take a couple of the things you like you know what i mean yeah it doesn't belong to them yet it's not it's not theft yeah an intent to buy does not make it your possession yeah you could take a grape because it doesn't hurt the integrity of the rest of the bunch of grapes no but what if you look at the bunch of grapes and you go how come this vine has one missing well that that's more of a karen thing to do that's not a reasonable nah there should be at least three more grapes on this i can see that why don't they pick it off by the butt are you allowed to open the pundit of blueberries and take one blueberry yeah well i think the the etiquette there is if nobody's gonna notice when they're buying the thing of blueberries or strawberries or grapes right you can't take a hot dog that's way too [ __ ] obvious hey ladies want to see a real vp the nord signal quick to the nord hole nordvpn man people just don't know how much money they can save using nordvpn i need you to get out there and save them you got a chief time to suit up sorry citizen i

vpn this city needs but not the one it deserves so anyway ladies you can save [ __ ] with no he watches over us 68 percent off [Music] my dad doesn't understand uh the internet fully well yet he's got an ipad now yeah but maybe two three four years ago whenever my mom went to visit our home country she went on her own because i refuse to go all i do is eat street food and get sick right yeah so i get home one day i can hear that the tv is on you know like the static or whatever so i was like oh my dad didn't live yeah open the door and my dad's watching porn in the living room oh my god i don't think he says anything maybe he just gives like a like a like a oh you know he just jumped up a bit and i just sort of put my head down and then went into the it went into my room and then yeah uh like an hour later half an hour later i'm like going to get a glass of water and he's like hey uh did you catch what was on the tv and i was like yeah and he was like don't tell your mom and i was like why would i tell mom why the [ __ ] would i why the [ __ ] would i have that conversation with mom i bet that was a relief though as soon as someone else is brought into the dynamic like don't tell your mum i bet it's like oh thank god this isn't about the awkwardness between me and him now yeah it very much was because later we did have a smart tv and my dad comes to me one day and goes hey how do you delete the search history on youtube and i was like i need to teach you how to do this actually you need to know how to do this so i go down to the search history and his most recent searches were like food coffee blah blah whatever and then i click into that tab and the four searches after that are like porn stars and i was like okay and he was like wait wait don't go that far and i was like chill i know what i understand this here's the button to clear the search history and he was like okay cool and then a year after that not that long ago i get him an ipad and he calls me and he goes cement your mom was out of the house so i was like all right i'll be by here's one thing i've noticed 5g people say oh that's ridiculous 5g and gonna hurt you and i agree oh okay if you start going on about 5g towers you had to get together you know people mostly tune out yeah i mean i'm not listening currently yeah exactly but let's say you went to someone's house and you took their wi-fi router okay and then started holding it next to their baby's head right all of a sudden you'd get in trouble yeah and it's like i feel like it's more etiquette around babies though yeah but it's like hold on a minute i thought you didn't believe it whatsoever but as soon as you put it next to their baby's soft skull right they'll go well don't do that please right at the very least yeah could you not yeah i feel like if you drop the stakes just a little bit like if instead of your newborn baby it's like your dog or something i feel like much more people would be like i mean yeah that's weird but whatever it's not gonna hurt anything i feel like you introduce anything to a baby it just sets the stakes too high yeah oh the safety's off it's like i don't care if the safety's on get it away from the baby yeah that's true okay yeah you could be like there's no bullet in the chamber there's no magazine in the gun this thing is just a replica yeah it's only a cap gun anyway can i pull the trigger no yeah exactly yeah exactly yeah you could probably have something that couldn't even be very dangerous like you could have two spoons yeah i was gonna get about two or something like a spatula yeah two spoons and just hold them next to a baby's head eventually tell someone would tell you to stop yeah yo get away from my baby you weird hobo like what are you doing with two spoons just holding two spoons what's the problem yeah exactly have you ever had situations where you've done something wrong but it's too complicated in the moment to explain what you've done wrong and you just have to kind of give up okay so this happened to me once i was at a dinner and there were maybe a dozen of us and we're we're all at this table it's like an outdoor setting and we're we're joking around i think we were talking about being rude to wait staff right i said oh yeah like the french where they just put their hand in the air and snap their fingers and say gas on right and i did that motion and then a waiter saw it and came over right and i was mortified because effectively i had just done the thing right i see oh my god i'm so sorry i didn't mean to to to bring you over like that and he had this look on his face like what and then i'm like trying to explain it and there's like a dozen of us there and it's like loud in a restaurant and it's like i've just done like the rudest thing and then it's like there's no way to explain and so you just go yeah i'll have the chicken schnitzel please at least in a french accent come on at least pretend you're a french tourist yeah and then it must have been like other people at other tables have seen it as well it's like i can't go over to them and explain to them right right has anything like that ever happened to you we saw him plant sitting at one of the neighbor's houses right so i'm supposed to go to the house every day or every other day okay dump some fish food in the fish tank water the plants and not order any pay-per-view porn on their teeth they didn't explicitly say that last part but i learned this after the fact wait how old are you how old are you i mean i wasn't 10 so 13 14 maybe okay they have a smart tv i don't have cable but i've never just had loan access to to pay-per-view and being able to order stuff so i'm browsing through the tv i'm just watching tv who's going to get mad at the plant sitter watching tv right and i'm browsing through the sections and i find the sections that say adult only or xxx or 18 plus or whatever everything's got a free preview to it so i'm watching the free previews you know at this point like i remember specifically think i was like this is wrong i don't want to get caught doing this but i have to know what a vagina looks like because i have no clue right i must have been younger let's say 12. and i was like that's what i'm gonna do yeah right find a scene i'm gonna find something where a girl shows her vagina and then i'm out of here and then i'm gonna be more knowledgeable than when i went in and this will be a net positive for me and i'm supposed to get paid 60 bucks for house setting their place for nine days and she calls me over gives me a text maybe knocks on my door i don't remember how we got in communication that day and she sits me down and she goes did you order anything on the tv and i was like uh i don't think so i uh not i don't think so and she was like we got a receipt for you know a certain film that we know is an adult film and immediately she goes i'm not going to tell your parents but did you order something on the tv and i was like i flipped through the tv i clicked on some buttons i'm not i swear i don't remember ordering anything of that nature turns out i didn't actually watch a free preview i did in fact order something that was 25 bucks that she took out of the money that she was gonna pay me and i was like cool um all right i'm gonna go home yeah so she just wanted the honesty out of you yeah and i couldn't even hear that i mean they live in the neighborhood so i see them like walking their dog and stuff at some point her husband walked up and was like just admit that you ordered something on the tv and i was like i don't know what you're talking about man and then we stopped talking after that camping okay i can't imagine any other time that i would be as polite as when i'm going [ __ ] camping you know you run into another tent say you've got absolutely no idea what these people could be like sure they could kill you and probably get away with it that's true if i ran across someone else and their tent i would not be getting anywhere near their tent yeah i would be standing about 30 feet away and be going hello right yeah you know what i mean yeah yeah yeah yeah you wouldn't like walk up to the tent and like unzip it or knock on the tent hello oh oh submitted you want to give quick rundown on why you don't shake with the left hand yeah so considering that everybody is right-handed the right hand is always used for eating and the left hand is always used for cleaning yourself on the toilet that's right and also uh usually you you hold your sword with the right hand as well so it shows oh i don't have anything dangerous in my hand right but problem with that i have seen a lot of cute right that's nice right but e is holding his left hand yeah so is there an etiquette between like who gets the right hand and who gets the left hand you know what i'm saying yeah probably not is he like the submissive one then it's not so they why barbers feel like it's okay to put their dick on your hand while they're cutting your hair that's true that's a thing i've never said that to somebody and they have they've had no idea what i'm talking about yep but a good portion of the time it's like come on man it's like the third time this haircut like what i can you can tell me to lean to a side so you don't need to [ __ ] stretch over dude yeah i know exactly what you mean have you ever said anything no but i always move and then the sheer fact that you've moved that's the sunset of enough area that they're like oh wait a second is a signal yeah maybe i should stop doing what i'm doing i still haven't figured out i don't know where to look someone's got me in a chair and they've put me in front of a mirror and it's like oh i guess i just stare at myself right i can't stare at the barber that's no good imagine just making eye contact with someone the whole time they're trying to cut your hair yeah it feels wrong but then you just like what's staring into space having like a an existential crisis in the mirror what am i who am i and a lot of the time unless you've got like airpods or something if you've got headphones you can't exactly wear them while you're getting your hair cut you never tell them that you didn't like the haircut yeah i remember seeing a meme that was like yo after my barber does my [ __ ] if he holds up the mirror and that mirror is a picture of him [ __ ] my mom i'd still be like yeah man looks great dude thank you i remember i was at the beach in la when we went to vidcon and me and my girlfriend saw people riding up and down the beaches on these double bicycles where the seats were like side by side and they all advertised the same little shack where you could rent the bikes so i went in and i was looking at the thing and i was like i think it's 36 for half an hour but that seems like a lot for a bike and there's nine bikes outside like hardly anybody's buying these things the dude working there must have overheard me say this out loud to my girlfriend but i went to make sure and i asked him and i was like hey how much are the bikes and he was like it's gonna be too much for you buddy i was like oh okay so it must be the 36 bucks for half an hour which yeah it does seem like way too much what if rude [ __ ] it's too expensive for you yeah bruh you know what you're supposed to do in that situation what you do is you go to your local bike store all right and then you buy like eight bikes open a bike store next to them no no then you walk back to the rental place and you hold four of the bikes in each hand and you go you work on commission right big mistake pretty woman my way out of there all right samito i'm afraid i'm facing through the floor right now that means it's time to leave goodbye is he is he gone has he phased through the floor all right twitch.tv slash sumato media hey what are you doing oh oh uh um uh i was recording a thing for my channel all right well looks like looks like the room is spinning that's that's your cue to leave leave my house please okay as i low budget animate my way over to stage left see you in a month goodbye,21:10
15AGWA9bTjo,Drew Gooden,Blog,Sequels That Aren't Sequels,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15AGWA9bTjo,3 years ago,6M views,Blog,"*gasp* Kindergarten Cop 2! I didn't know they made a sequel to my favorite movie... Starring my favorite actor... ~Arnold~ wait! Arnold! How come you never told me about this? You know, I would have loved to see it Arnold Turn around all the way Thank you. Look Arnie. If you don't want to talk about this, that's fine. But at least sit down and watch it with me Man this movie's gonna be so good cuz they made it 26 years after the first one so Lot of time to write a good script. Well, it's weird that guy. Uh Kind of looks like you but like a worse version of you. When do you come in? Okay new scene So this is probably where they introduce you. Oh, I guess you weren't in that scene either Is this where you come in? is this where you come in? is this where you come in? Ah, commercial Today's video is sponsored by expressvpn *fading* go to expressvpn.com/drew... Oh It's back on Is this where you come in? Something doesn't feel right... I'm starting to get the weirdest suspicion that you're not in this movie, but that doesn't make sense It's the sequel to kindergarten cop. Of course you're in it-- Oh, they're playing the credits So do you come in after the credits or? Of course I will Arnold I would do anything for you Um, so I'll be back in like 15-20 minutes if you want anything to drink there's some La croix's in the fridge yeah, okay Hey guy, welcome back to one of those bins at Walmart that has all the $5 DVDs in it. I'm your host Tiger Woods So a couple weeks ago I made a video about movie reboots that no one asked for there's a thousand of them coming out every day But as bad as it is to see a movie or show you once loved Lazily rehashed by a group of people that has seemingly no connection to the first one, other than the fact that they both... Made a movie, there is one good thing about remakes and it's that at least you know It's a remake. Like when Disney announces they're making a new live-action Kim Possible movie I don't think oh they're making more of the thing I like I can look at it and see that it's just a brand new Entirely different thing that just happens to have the same name as the thing I like Sometimes though Hollywood tries to pull a fast one on us by announcing They're making a sequel and you think, ""cool More thing all my friends from the first movie are back and they're gonna do another shenanigan. I can't wait"" Oh. no one from the first one is in it and it's a different writer and it's a different director And the whole crew is different and all the actors are different in the story has nothing to do with the first one, okay So it's not the sequel this may sound crazy but to me a sequel is like When the Star Wars guys are here, and then the Star Wars guys go there, and then who knows, maybe they end up here! I'm not in charge. to me, those are sequels cuz it's the same people Continuing the same story You can't just hire a bunch of random people to make a random movie and then slap a number two Next to the title of a different movie and say it's the next one This is the next movie So originally this was gonna be a very long video about three different movies that all fit this description But I realized I have so much to say about each movie that it makes more sense to split this up into three parts So this video is part one and today we're only gonna be focusing on Kindergarten Cop 2 Kindergarten cop came out in 1990 and it is... Perfectly fine. It's not the BEST movie--Sorry Arnold--but it's managed to last a pretty long time as an enjoyable enough family-friendly action movie/ now Kindergarten Cop 2--you know, the sequel--came out in 2016! 26 years after the first one. So literally no one is asking for it at this point. Also, because it's 26 years old I don't think anyone was expecting a 70 year old Arnold Schwarzenegger to come out of retirement to reprise his Unforgettable role as whatever his character's name was in the first one. It's totally understandable They want to reboot this movie and go with another young, handsome buff guy to play the teacher But they didn't do that. They got a guy named Dolph Lundgren who's 60! I guess They just figured this is like the closest they could get to Arnold cuz he's also foreign and also old? ""this machine Owes me a god damn twix bar!"" ""HEY, WOAH!"" You may know Dolph from his most famous role as Drago in rocky 4 He's pretty much the same character in this movie except instead of fighting Sylvester Stallone He just goes around kissing a bunch of women who are half his age. That's basically the whole movie. like take the very first scene For example, he's in this hotel room with a young girl who kind of looks like him You're like me your first reaction was oh that must be his daughter, right? That's his daughter No, that's his girlfriend. But before they can finish their makeout sesh the FBI shows up to save him from the bad guys And she hits him in the face. ""I'm sorry"" And before we even have time to ask questions, like ""wait, what's going on?"" And, ""who was she?"" she walks out the door and you never see her again. Don't worry about our friend Dolph though He'll bounce back. you see lucky for him He lives in a universe where every woman in the world Swoons at the mere sight of him. random girl in the FBI headquarters the first shot of whom is a gratuitous close-up on her ass? Swoon. principal of the elementary school Dolph needs to infiltrate for their mission? Swoon. Everyone loves Dolph. It doesn't end there though How could it--we're only 12 minutes into the movie--because now it's time for the meet-cute. ""sorry to interrupt But I have a situation that can't really wait Brooklyn is out of her meds again..."" You guys can probably tell that she is going to be the main love interest of this movie Is there anything weird about that? You know when you look at him and you look at her? Is there anything weird about that you guys notice anything? I like this shot where he's like leaning back to like watch her walk away You know, to look at her BUTT, but like she's--what does he see here? What is he--there's a wall. ""when can you start?"" Seems like a lot of extra editing there just to say that it's lunchtime. uh, but this lunch scene is great. So first he has to microwave a girl's tofu. It's just two pieces of tofu It wasn't, like, cooked in with something else. her parents just gave her two sticks of cold tofu Then while that's microwaving, you see that all the kids are eating like uncooked pieces of broccoli But then he's like ""what, tofu, vegetables, gluten-free? That's dumb. I'm gonna eat my peanut butter and jelly sandwich"" and just at the sheer mention of the word 'peanut', the whole class erupts in screams. *children screaming* Because this ONE kid has a peanut allergy. so the principal comes in, who--I guess she could hear the chaos? she must be like right next door uh But she comes in, rushes him out. and then the microwaved tofu Explodes because, of course it did. it's been in there for like nine minutes. Then there's some more gratuitous shots of half-naked women to show that this isn't a family movie. It's just a bad movie So then he gives the kids a bunch of cookies for no reason and they all go apeshit *song with lyrics, ""I want candy!"" Because I guess he's so disconnected from children that he doesn't even know that sugar will make them hyper This is literally a scene from the first one. all the kids are going crazy, he freaks out. even his growl Sounds like Arnold. *Dolph makes strange growl-like noise* then one girl comes up and says she has to go to the bathroom, but he has to take her. Girl: ""I need to go to the bathroom."" Teacher: ""I'll take care of her."" So then he does, and that's how he meets the other teacher who he's already met in the beginning But she still says ""nice to meet you"". She says it twice in two different scenes. "" It was nice to meet you"" ""It was nice to meet you."" and then she comes in and just, claps a couple times and Reverses the effects of all the sugar that the kids ate. ""don't get me started on these little brats. Sometimes I just want to, UGH!"" ""Woah, woah, woah woah."" You just wanna what, kill the kids? you're gonna fucking murder the kids? cuz that's what that sounds like. ""UGH!"" ""so... I'm just gonna have to rely on you then"" *laughs* *flirtatiously* ""I guess you will."" Let me know when the two of them are supposed to start having chemistry. 'cause I don't see it. I know that's what they're forcing with this scene, with the little music, and through the smiling at each other He's fucking twice her age. I love how in the next scene where he's driven home from school His shirt has different paint stains on it. I think they just forgot what color the paint was. All right So now day two, he has the bright idea to come in and blow an airhorn right in all of their faces. Uh, and they all start crying. so the principal gets pissed and gives him one strike, out of three. So he goes back to the FBI And then asked his friend to give him an earpiece so he can give him some pointers. This happens during the day He went back to the FBI. So I don't know who's watching the kids at this point. I guess time just stops. So he can go do that... This is really edited like this in the movie. What happened guys? There's like a weird cut and then his audio is dubbed Not sure what not sure what that's all about and then shortly afterwards were introduced to Hal who is Essentially a human punching bag and the butt of almost all of the remaining jokes in the movie Most of these jokes pretty much boil down to 'fat man is nerd, So we laugh.' Dolph: ""the city of Troy was heavily fortified. The Greeks had no way of getting inside."" Hal: ""uh, please be careful with my soldiers. They're-they're collectors"" Ha, fucking nerds. *Hal gasps while kids chant something unintelligible* Kid: ""Ooo-la-la!"" Even the kids aren't weirded out by the forced chemistry between these two people. ""like, on a date?"" ""Uh-huh."" *Drew mocks him* ""Talking to Olivia?"" ""yeah."" ""I called dibs on her."" you silly nerd. You can't call dibs on a woman! Plus this guy is much more handsome than you, and DEFINITELY not a hundred years old. ""I'm taking her out tonight"" *Hal makes weird disappointed noise? Then cracks his neck* *Drew mocks Hal* You know cuz he's a nerd, and that's what nerds do...I guess. ""but I called dibs!"" ""that's impossible. You on the geek squad."" ha, fucking nerd. ""dinner, romantic lighting, talking."" ""ooo, I'll get to do all that?"" ""Yeah, dates are about getting to know someone!"" ""I'm messing with you man' Half the time when Dolph is talking it looks like he's asleep. *Drew's voice* ""Don't even worry about this man. I got this under control."" ""I think dates are for getting to know someone *song starts playing on record player* ""As long as I've got you!"" Oh wow you ARE old-school!"" yeah, cuz he's old! ""Most guys that I date now, they just want to meet for drinks and have sex ""Great, Now you tell me?"" was this supposed to not be weird at some point? this whole date scene hurts to watch! ""and I really do Want to get to know you."" ""What do you want to know?"" Why are you here? Why did you go on a date with me? Are you attracted to me? Why are you attracted to me? Those are just a few of my questions. ""Twix?"" this movie is brought to you by Twix. Look when I'm not out there fighting crime--I-I-I mean teaching kindergarten There's one thing I like to do in my free time and that's eat a candy bar. ""It's sort of my thing."" Twix: ""How do you stay in such good shape if you eat so much sugar?"" ""you want me to show you how I stay in shape?"" *Honky-tonk country music starts playing* *cheering in background* Yeah, slow motion bull-riding scene! ooh, zoom in on her stomach! that's what this kids movie needs. *Olivia breathing heavily* Oh God, the chemistry between him and this 19-year-old girl is SO palpable! No No Don't no. No, no, don't do it. No, but literally nobody wants you to do this Noooo Stop, that's too much. Oh, I hate this. I hate this scene. I hate this movie I want it to end. ""can we continue this some other time?"" ""...yeah."" ""Take you home?"" mind if I take you home, I'm only very drunk. FBI agent: ""We are running out of time!"" It's been four days, how are we not done with this mission yet? ""TIME IS RUNNING OUT!"" ""This is a place of peace, not war."" *Hal, in pain*: ""AW, MY NUTS!"" ""Ew, I shot his nuts!"" Okay, I was wrong! this movie's fucking hilarious. he just got tasered in the dick and shit his pants *whispering* ""Hal, did you shit yourself?"" *Hal breathes heavily* The scene that kids love. Dolph: ""get the baby wipes"" Perfect! throw in some more half-naked women, you know, for all the toddlers watching. Oh what, you thought every other scene in this movie was uncomfortable to watch? wait till you see this auction they're auctioning off a date with Dolph who, once again, is 60 years old. and you got all These hot young girls--and one guy--willing to throw hundreds of dollars. Keep in mind These are teachers, they're on a teacher's salary, but they're willing to throw out 500 bucks 600 bucks to have one night with Dolph ""Can you count 950?"" ""Two thousand dollars!"" $2,000 to go on a date with a guy. She's already gone on a date with. ""come on!"" ha, fuckin nerd. ""every guinea pig loves..."" ""carrots!"" ""and"" ""people love guinea pigs!"" ""Nice job guys."" *clapping* This movie's like the Cliff Notes version of the first one. literally this is day five. pretty much Nothing has happened! Day two, he was blowing an airhorn in these kids' faces, and they all cried. Three days later They're giving him a hug. ""time capsule!"" ""time capsule."" ""time capsule!"". So then they finally figure out where this flash drive is, That's the reason he's been here the whole time, but the bad guys show Up and they capture them. and the other teacher feels betrayed because she didn't know he was FBI She just thought he was a teacher ""So everything that we are, it's all just an act to you."" everything that we are. it's been five. fucking. days! ""I didn't lie about my feelings for you."" ""I don't have feelings for Kristi north!"" So they pour out all of the contents of the time capsule, You know, the thing they're burying to open up in the future and see what life in 2016 was like, and there's three things in there. the flash drive, a piece of cardboard I guess?, and a little hammer. you're telling me that the entire school went on this fucking field trip to bury a time capsule With a hammer and a piece of cardboard in it? seems a little pointless if you ask me. Twix? Okay. It's a good candy bar. Twix: it's a good candy bar. So anyway, they defeat the bad guys in a very underwhelming final scene, The kids kick some butt. Even the nerd gets in on the action. and even though she was just pissed off like ten minutes ago, Now she's ready to kiss his big beautiful face again. And for a reason I will never understand, the final shot of the movie is Just a close-up on this pig. That's the last shot. and then it says 'the end' while they play a cover of the Jackson 5 ABC song Which they also played earlier in the movie? They played the same song in the movie twice, probably because they didn't want to spend any more money on licenses to other music. So you see what I'm saying. at best, this is an unnecessary remake of a movie that came out so long ago that it's completely irrelevant at this point. and at worst, it's just a creepy movie that's too raunchy for kids to watch and too stupid for adults to enjoy. 2 out of 10. and just when I thought this movie couldn't get any weirder, I watched the credits and realized there's characters named 'hot single dad', 'Hot mom', 'super hot mom', and 'smokin hot mom'. Don't get those two confused, they are two different people. another weird fact about this movie is that it was written by someone who seems to specialize in this sort of, uh, sequel non-sequel thing He also wrote 'Bigger fatter Liar'. ""Big Fat Liar is already being counted as next summer's must-see movie event."" ""That guy stole my paper!"" ""Larry Wolf is about to release highly Anticipated game Big Fat Liar."" ""that jerk stole my game!"" an all-new movie and Paul Giamatti *distorted* MOVIE And he's also writing, and this hasn't come out yet, but I'm very excited to not watch it, 'Grand-Daddy Daycare'. It's the sequel to 'Daddy Daycare' starring Eddie Murphy. Now, if you had to guess what 'Grand-Daddy Daycare' is about, you'd probably guess it is, instead of dads taking care of kids, It's very old men taking care of kids, right? granddaddy daycare cuz daddy day care was about daddies running a daycare So this is a granddaddy daycare, right? No. ""thank you so much for watching dad all day"" ""ah it's No problem."" ""here, at least take 100. the senior home charges 300."" ""I got it all figured out: granddaddy daycare."" this movie's about middle-aged men taking care of older men What? You know what else I just realized? I've left Arnold in my living room for over 20 minutes completely unsupervised I gotta go make sure he didn't drink all my La Croix's. Arnold? Arnold... *sound of La Croix can getting stepped on* Arnold? buddy? Oh, There you are! listen, I'm not mad that you drank all my La Croix but, I-- *Drew makes sound of disgust* What the fuck? La Croix: just don't drink it. All right bitch, you're helping me do this ad read. Perfect, oh it looks like I have arms coming out of my head.

stuck here sir on the edge of the flat earth here well we're just gonna have to have faith that he'll find his way over meanwhile back at home we're building more crap on top of the city centre cuz why not he looking if we place this just right it looks like the berries are coming out of the sawmill huh it's weird who could have foreseen this all my builders don't want to build it's almost like they can't reach what they need to build okay fine I will uncouple this stuff when we'll do it the right way we're gonna put the sawmill next to the other thing in near the river yeah get that wood in the water that's so I'm noticing a bit of a problem every so often the game is like more people are joining your village and I'm like well where are they surely they can just come over here and swim but no that's not what's happening just way over on the edge of the map all these little serial killers just waiting for their chance so I guess what I'm trying to say is we're on our own that's okay we'll just make grace to everything there you go just blink once and I'll give you a break okay then I'll assume you're happy doing all the work I love all the people on the background just creepily watching yeah there she goes now build everything on your own next thing the game wants us to do is fill the needs of our newcomers which is a funny proposition considering they're all just hanging out over here I don't even know what the creepiest thing is here is it this dude staring at her or is it this lady staring at us anyway all that being said there's no reason we can't build a well in a market and all this other stuff without them look at all these exciting options we have for building a market I guess we're gonna do a food stall cuz I don't really know what else we can do on our tiny island listen grace I don't want to tell you how to do your job but I don't think that's what that tool is for you no never mind you do your thing okay cool we got our market we got our well we got that creepy person just staring at us from back there why are you waving a saw around are you selling body parts over there oh god nevermind do what you want to do doing that promoted our people to serfs Oh what's this a message from the kingdom the kingdom recognizes your efforts in establishing your settlement alright three things one why is my only option to be nice to I'd like to see them get over here and three maybe don't stab yourself in the face but it looks like saying I'm your humble servant gives me four swords and forward things oh it's these things up here so the hammer means labor and the swords mean Kingdom and if click on these it brings up all kinds of stuff you could unlock like a warehouse and we can't do because we need 10 serfs oh we can't get more people onto our island thankfully the game has us covered and we can build a wooden bridge all right yeah that seems good again with the saw is that how you dig shallow graves - I sure hope our people are still over there oh yeah they are um does a horse wanna join my village I mean what the hey why not really though why not just start your own village you have like twice the people oh my god it's done couldn't have come at a better time either three people left which I guess they must have swam away wait no I was wrong I got my hopes up the bridge isn't done yet it still has all that progress bar left to go heaven forbid you use it before that railing is on there finally okay everyone let's go the gates are open I'm sorry did you change your mind why are you all still standing here oh there you go turns out that was more than one horse there I feel like this is now officially an attack but at least human centipede is on the way hello welcome to our sleepy little village 7,000 envoys are here and they all request an audience okay let's do this one by one I guess the quest name is eating out what my lord we need to choose who we want to help King clergy people are myself the quest appears to be delivered twenty fish we're gonna assist the people this time because if we go over here to the labor tab eventually we can unlock a tax office in other words investing in the people means eventually exploiting them okay buy one rider whoo God I have to accept all these quests at once don't I now I'm just clicking whatever cuz who cares well I took a lot of quests all of them do in 60 days jokes on them there's no way I can do this in 60 days maybe the berries thing but I don't even know how to fish yet oh man these people have no idea what they're signing up for okay well let's get started especially since I already lost three days waiting for you to get here okay we just need 90 berries so for our gathering Hut let's assign some villagers yeah look at them go that's how you feed a nation you know what's really weird to me is how you make money in this game basically your villagers need to eat and since berries are all we have that's what we sell at the market I don't know where they get their money but I do know we're selling their own berries back to them and turning a profit and once we reach 500 gold we can buy another piece of land okay let's expand over to this one with the other berry bush oh yeah wasting no time definitely not wasting any arms we've been able to make so much money off the berry industry that to mic them bleep this may we're actually gonna be able to deliver on these quests and we maxed out on gold again time to expand I'm thinking this juicy one right here that way we can expand and stay on an island and then I failed all the other ones but who cares and let's put another bridge down there you go I love it they waste no time okay I've been doing this for a little while now 71 people in my village one thing I haven't touched upon yet is it turns out people expect space for housing okay fine I will get you a place for housing just not here because we're getting so much money let's keep expanding our territories you know out here seems pretty good for housing so the way this works is if I go up here in color where housing is allowed I guess we just color it in and okay yeah Jesus said didn't take any time at all people are already claiming land think of it as like the suburbs and I actually know what I just realized I don't think they can get over here now there's a river cross and right through this whole thing even better all you people think you're gonna get housing you could say I fixed the housing crisis with all these not built houses okay so things are looking good we got tons of supplies plenty of food to go around and housing beautiful theoretical housing I think it's time we civilize the people with a rustic church oh my god there's so many options for how to build it let's start with the core okay ghost Cathedral let's do this right there seems good what's this arrow for oh oh oh limit to this if there is I'm not seeing it pulling it up as far as I can oh man can I go higher than this somehow what if I just move the whole screen forward oh yeah there's no limit to this oh no I'm still going up game is not doing so high oh Jesus game game is slowing down significantly okay letting go everything where did all the land go wait wait oh I was just really far out there well where's the monument yep there it is that's as high as the screen will go so I guess it goes higher than that for now we're not gonna make it this big because the game is now running at 10 FPS so let's make it a little smaller oh and that crashed the game okay lesson learned smaller rustic Church got it we'll go with a modest 20 floor one instead oh we need to add like doors and stuff okay small Tower tell me about that okay I've had just like suctions to the side and of course these can go high too and then maybe put small Tower - okay these just keep going well watch out people churches in town okay well now I have to know can these act is like a wall oh they can go in the water okay cool Jesus what am i doing no really Jesus tell me I'm gonna need some doors too but door one down there door two over here and door three I don't even know where sure the perfect Church start construction it's only gonna take 1500 stone 1300 planks and 170 one sets of tools welp it turns out you can do this a glorious monument that's almost impossible to see in the game you know with the oscillating wood stone design in this incredibly practical doorway and now our marketplace is on the other side of this wall so it looks like some kind of creepy back-alley deal doing this rustic Church also gave us something called splendor 140 of it to be exact which if we look at the unlockables he's gonna be more than enough food but for now we can unlock rustic Church additional parts there they are stone grave we got to do it there you go enjoy those stone graves okay we learned three interesting things by building this one you can build really high - you can totally build in the water and three possibly the most exciting you can build on land you don't own okay so we know this monstrosity over here contributed to the clergy let's see if we can't do the same for the kingdom tab let's unlock the wooden Keith in the large stone wall or what's this a message from the kingdom we shall allow you to establish an outpost on your territory as such you will be able to participate in military campaigns for your leads you don't forget this is a privilege we're gonna comply because I'm hoping that means there's more people to screw with yeah sure that sounds awful okay build a wooden keep let's do it which I can't think of a better place to put them in the water don't worry we'll make it nice and tall just like everything else and we can buy some cute little training dummies that we're gonna put at the bottom of the ocean yeah this makes sense and it looks like we can build some wooden gates which I'm not even going to attach to the thing they're just gonna be like victory rung as you go through to get to my town yeah Oh 870 planks this is gonna take forever and done a message from the kingdom a message from King stabby face the kingdom has noticed your keep your giant girth iki am I calling you to aid in a military campaign well that I guess I shall think about training soldiers there look at you proud soldiers how are you even planning to get in there oh I see yeah you guys work hard on those training dummies really show the enemy what you're all about I also realize something that's either awesome or crippling depending on how you look at it you know my big beautiful church here first of only 20 people can be inside I don't know why but also I didn't realize but its upkeep is 281 gold which helps to explain my amazing 39,000 gold death seeing us I don't think I'm coming wait what are you guys doing what are you guys doing now oh this is just your preferred way to get back to land no all right so considering our amazing dead think we need to start looking at stuff that we can build it doesn't cost money what about this Lord Manor only takes 50 planks just like everything else where I can put it anywhere splendid and you shall exist on this island away from all the riffraff you know they even gonna be able to get over here to build this yes we'll find out what's this war is coming they want me to help let's see if I deploy troops I get a thousand gold which is gonna do nothing for my debt even a free territory we're gonna do it for that territory and for the prospect that some of you may die okay you know what it's time to finally fish let's build our Fisher's Hut well I feel like I should have to put this like on water right and I just put it right here will this work well I guess there's only one way to find out well there it is oh boy here comes a true warrior how are you gonna go fish oh well yeah I guess I don't know why I'm remotely surprised by this I mean isn't this how you fish why even use the rod at that point why just grab them with your bare hands hi another successful outing fishing I like how these two pass each other like this is completely normal Oh back so soon are we all have a good time at war jeez talk about all business right back to the training well at least we got our free territory okay I learned something new and exciting it turns out if you reload the game your debt just goes away well that's kind of nice I guess that means I can start making money again no wait no here comes the dead again I also completely forgot about this lovely fellow but it's done to jog anyone else's memories this is my or manner which it looks like we can assign parts Oh functions huh Treasury your Great Hall expand my gold capacity by six hundred how can I say no to that and we'll assign that to every tower in our tower of towers I'm glad to know we now have the potential of thirty five hundred gold emphasis on potential you know what else I just noticed too when people show up to go to church for some reason they go through the back door only well this seems like a great time to experiment with building walls I see we got wooden walls large stone walls and hedges I mean obviously we're going with hedges oh yeah can this just go right over like that well they do this can I okay there we go oh yeah what do you guys dog damn it fine you leave me no choice wooden wall it is see how you like this really well you all really want to go to church don't you just for thoroughness let's try the big ones too wait no it appears to be working after all tell me what's going wrong warning window I am stuck trying to go to the market I'm stuck trying to go to my house sounds like everything is a-okay to me then you could just take the front door there then pop out the back door it's so easy okay I moved the walls back don't say I didn't do anything for you okay so as much as I hate to say it I think we're gonna have to open up to the housing apparently to upgrade to all the good stuff we need to get people to become commoners and I think the only way to do that is to actually allow them to have housing I know we're great I don't know why they're not good with this vagrant lifestyle but if we're gonna do this we're gonna do this right and we're gonna give them ample protection by that I mean this rickety wooden gate wait a min I just well isn't this just festive what about this will this work is a wall too I mean if there's no opening it would appear so people are having trouble getting to the market again if I painstakingly delete enough of these to open up like a little opening okay sweet it looks like they can deal with this you're thinking what I'm thinking right this will work as a tunnel right everyone loves tunnels this is great really adds a dimension to our town so let's compromise okay you want to build houses and I want to let you have that at a cost and we're gonna have this bridge start I don't know yeah this seems good right it's only gonna need 3900 planks that's actually not nearly as bad as it could be but we've really got all the units on this one glad to see it's such a community effort well shiver me timbers there it is this beautiful bridge is definitely gonna help people get to where they need to go oh wait is it you know what I actually don't think it will nope I forgot do that crap in the distance I forgot it's separated from this by water and God knows they're not gonna be able to figure out to just climb off the bridge well I guess the only humane thing to do is build another bridge so all we got to do put it here drag this side over here all the way over to this little island yeah that'll do yes get to work my pretties and don't even think about hopping off the bridge to a better life especially you grace just think though this is one more stepping stone to getting to your house okay there we are we're that much closer I stay closer because they still can't get over there clumsy me this one doesn't connect either I guess I mean we got to put another bridge down right yeah that seems like that makes a lot of sense okay we built this bridge and so much more let's take you for a quick tour built a couple extra bridges you know I just wanted to make sure people had a way to get around and to make sure everything was nice and efficient I made sure that there's a bridge it'll take you anywhere you want to go I mean unless where you want to go is the housing because none of these bridges go over here still the one piece of land that needs a bridge technically anyway I mean look at this madness clearly gravity means nothing to them just fly your way over there bridges aren't limited to this area though there's also a bunch leading to my lowered manner over here but what's this in the background remember all those walls we figured out we could make well it sure makes for a great maze spanning this entire side of the landscape visitors and new citizens can expect a lengthy and tireless journey as they traverse the endless twists and turns of total despair all I know is I didn't have to own the land to put this down which just makes it even better oh and at some point I wasn't sure how but I glitched one of the walls so just kind of extends a ways out into the great beyond but more exciting than that it extends the other way too and ends up doing some crazy stuff like this I'm not sure why the wooden top of the stone wall goes underneath while the stone wall stays above but it certainly makes for interesting bridge choices and really that's why you'd want to come to this Kingdom right I certainly can't think of any other reasons actually I can think of one and it's this glorious wheat farm sticking out the side of our church why look I think some of the wheat is coming in right now sand hell oh you Kidder's you know no one's coming to help you so I feel like our looking pretty good oh yeah the housing thing how quickly I forget well I guess I do owe it to him and this bridge will finally take them home good job team you build that bridge hey grace why are you just standing there what's troubling you is it the part where for some reason we're only getting like 20 frames per second it's not like I've been busy doing something while you were building not busy doing anything at all I like to think of it more as corridors of sadness I mean like if you get lost it's not that bad there's even spots where you can take a quick breather then you get your salvation at the end a homestead to call your own turns out it doesn't matter though I'm not sure why but some wonky things have happened most of my citizens have gone completely brain-dead they're either hanging out here looking all creepy at the city center yes I'm talking about you sir or for some reason they're all super creep Lee congregating around this well slowly turning into this weird mass of eyes and in this guy's case all the noses races this you're doing actually grace I got some other questions for you there's my in-game time it's been 594 weeks that's 11 years I remember your profile when we started you were 20 years old then and you're 20 years old now I sense foul play I need to protect these citizens protect them from you hope it's cozy in there here we go I'm sure it'll be fine at least you don't age so that won't kill you here they come so you all we had to do is take out the ringleader look at all that we've accomplished once you're encased in a wooden cocoon now these people's lives can finally begin harmony at last like I was saying earlier we can't forget to give them some protection and one for you I'm not even gonna let you finish maybe just a few more doors okay and there you have it a beautiful village what the hell are you doing over there didn't you heed the warnings okay village contained well I would say we adequately dealt with this kingdom can't imagine the king out there's gonna be asking for my help again anytime soon so I hope you had fun I know I did I give this game five out of five graces trapped in a wooden sarcophagus I think I'm gonna take one of these rails back to my Lord Manor right now we're all the way to the top and have myself a good cry and I'll see you next time",18:57
BvEKky9N1tQ,Let's Game It Out,VideoGames,I Built a Theme Park of Perpetual Torment in Planet Coaster,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvEKky9N1tQ,2 years ago,24M views,VideoGames,"hey there it's Josh welcome back to let's game it out we're playing planet coaster today I've never played this game before I have played a lot of planets zoo and that game is great for shall we say dealing with animals but my sense is that planet coaster has something the planet zoo doesn't and that's more mayhem of the human variety so buckle up let's get started we're gonna build our beautiful coaster right here in the city yes game thank you please serenade me with these city noises name your Park coast way to the heavens own battle do here we are outside the beautiful city a bustling downtown with an aggressive amount of traffic well I can see why you'd want to spend a day at the roller coaster park seems a tad stressful let's leave all that behind and go retreat to a theme park run by a maniac is this the entrance to my park some random bear cave where does this even lead oh to a teleporter I get it you didn't use physical exertion you just use magic ok so again I've played planet Zoo and all this stuff looks real similar even some of these items look the same from what I'm used to oh this is different fireworks of all kinds like this one shaped like a skull well now I got to see what this looks like home well that's just splendid and of course now we need to see what happens when we put a bunch of these down up you go and oh yeah that's great well now we've got to continue with this glorious blanket of fireworks okay go really just one that's all you're gonna oh my eyes Oh goodbye frame rate that didn't take very long wonder how many of these you can add okay so I added a few more okay I added a lot more I can't really tell you how many are there because at a point the game just won't draw them anymore until you get closer but if my count is accurate there's something like a hundred to 150,000 fireworks in here so maybe consider averting your eyes this might get really bright uh yeah it's like a nukes going off oh yeah I think this might actually be all we're gonna get the game appears to be taking up 78% of my CPU and almost 38 gigs of RAM in fact I'm kind of surprised that it's still going at all up wait there it goes okay I think that might have been a little much let's not do that again so let's move on and see what these other fireworks can do and for that first we're gonna build a little Tower ah beautiful and we'll just load it up with some fireworks watch out everybody something threatens our fair city the threat of having too much fun look I know tens of thousands was too many but how am I supposed to not do this like well I have this in the game if not to fire it like a cannon ah there we go how festive yet deadly alright let's see how this looks yeah that's what I'm talking about well now that the city is on lockdown I mean it looks like besides fireworks we also have electricity and water and pyrotechnics oh my god flamethrower okay seriously who's building a park in using this responsibly I'm gonna go with not many I certainly won't be hey you two were not open yet I said we're not open yet all right suit yourself don't say I didn't warn you what you two made it through somehow oh this won't do at all I guess it's finally time to dive into the coaster part planet coaster this seems like the perfect time to test the thing I'm really wondering about human casualties my goodness there's so many to choose from come on steel vengeance let's go do God's work seeing how this is a test I really don't want to miss we'll just go ahead and set this up right here and we'll make sure the track goes down right into the soft part of their cranium and then just kind of loop back up at the last minute it's gonna be perfect okay let's test it YouTube buckle up a magical journey is about to take place really really are you people immune to everything so be it you got lucky this time maybe you can't hit people when the train is still on the tracks so let's crank all the speed up to the highest it can go let's see how test number 2 goes um dum dee dum oh just here for a nice day at the oh no okay this seems to have worked slightly better good at least something will take these people out I was the love when the coaster crust pop out of existence this collateral damage here I'll leave you a little warning sign now you never need to wonder what you should do no guesswork required okay so as much as I'm enjoying the feather-light touch of this particular coaster I can't help but wonder if we can get a little more velocity going so let's retire this reliable beast well this sounds fun hydraulic launch let's go ahead and put it up here so the people don't even see it coming let's not go too wild but we'll put it a little bit higher let's see what is this launch system that propels trains its speed along the track god yes let's see target speed highest I can go acceleration fast as it can go yes optional catwalk the maintenance people are gonna need that when this thing goes at a perfect 90 degree angle and down we go test one let's do this definitely off to a good start what with the beam completely vertical and all hey buddy have you thought about looking up yes not okay well this seems plenty effective yep that'll do it well this seems like it's been overall quite successful hey wait a minute this gives me an idea now our guard tower here has admittedly limited range you know it can probably get more distance perhaps some manner of roller-coaster placed really really really really high in the sky impossibly high some would say oh my god yeah yeah that's gonna be good okay let's see target speed 100 miles an hour acceleration rate all of it and just like before it's gonna be a steady ride all the way down what could possibly go wrong buckle up or don't I don't care I know I sure would love to ride something on a 90 degree turn you see easy Oh just didn't clear it that's okay first time out not bad let's try and extend this a little bit everything else the same except slightly more runway at the end test number two don't let me down well we lost one and the others well ah no closer okay let's try a different coaster like the flying stingray all because it has the word flying in it oh my God look at this majesty okay hopefully this will be different this time so wholly based on the idea that the track is on the underside and with my zero understanding of physics I think that'll mean it'll slingshot with much velocity have a good trip my horizontal friends oh my god this would just be barf central wouldn't it you don't even get to see anything cool like you're steering away from the city but you'll get the ultimate view now bye oh my god this is feeling promising we did it yeah finally we've weaponized a roller coaster against a city well that was fun where was I oh yeah I forgot this is all still happening down here have you people just been getting terrorized this entire time do you need help getting off the lawn here I think I know what I can use to help and it's not gonna feel like overkill at all hey you might want to turn around there's some magic happening behind you any second now wow they just cease to exist hey kid you might want to move Oh it just all happened so fast I'm kind of curious now with all this velocity if there's actually any rhyme or reason to how far people fly but for a good test I feel like we're gonna need more people than this so I guess that means we got to build some stuff to attract people I know build a theme park in a theme park game I'm pretty freaked out too not a big one though I just need a space for people to congregate and if there's one thing I know people love it's like gift shops and stuff cool this pre-made thing will do yep I see em too buddy our first victims well these stands don't appear to be very popular that's not stopping crabs from getting stuck trying to leave or enter this is definitely more of what I wanted so I think it's time for experiment number one c'mere you test one ready to go this guy here has like the best job on the planet doesn't he just knows what's gonna happen and they just fill in the gap like it never happened oh my god they really go flying I think this is better than I possibly could have hoped for just sprinkling bodies everywhere welp no sense and stop in there let's invite some friends along I'm sure the public will appreciate this I'll never get tired of this actually the part where they just don't seem to see it coming there's so many people out here with fresh bodies arriving all the time there's so many people here it's starting to look like an outdoor festival it's a shame though after a certain amount of time the game just resets them off the grass so I wonder is there a way to keep these people over here okay let's do a test if I build a nice lovely stone column will people be able to pass through it well only one way to find out oh yes they can impact with it all right well we know what we need to do now okay there we go my hideous weird-looking rock wall welp let's see if the wall catches these people oh goody has it's like confetti but it's bodies happy birthday to us okay this is putting them in a somewhat more localized area but I don't know if this is actually helping the area of impact is still rather wide what we need is a way to refine this like a big rock trough I duplicate this and then just kind of move it out yeah okay just kind of lightly put it at an incline should work is really rough and uncomfortable people collector right okay let's collect some victims I mean people good old enough of them are bouncing okay yeah I think it's working oh yeah look they're all sliding down there with all those broken bones and stuff I'm just so pleased that my people trough is working what must this journey look like let's see what it looks like from the perspective of oh this kid okay I've got the camera on him right now let's restart time well you know he's making this look kind of fun especially the party impacts with the rock and probably breaks most of his bones way down and then surrounded by only strangers don't worry this is your new family now okay Stage two we got to make sure these people don't vanish and I think we can accomplish that by putting paths down okay I don't know if this will do the job but let's see okay so it looks like they still feel lost or in the process of breaking all their bones I'm gonna assume that it's because while they're on a path now path isn't actually connected to anything it's let's test this I build a path out of here and all the way back to the beginning but like if I connect it on the side before the pay thingy are these people gonna try and sneak into the park nope they seem to be pretty good about it they're just spacing themselves out smart move meanwhile back at this abomination oh it looks like the path is working looks like if people keep going they'll get out of here safely you know what though let's not make it too easy for people let's at least make them work for it so let's go ahead and take them underground you know just a little ways underground and then back to the surface the very normal surface okay so you might be wondering how is it that so many people are going in and yet so few people seem to be emerging well don't you worry their journey isn't done yet so first everyone just goes straight down into the hole and just like you'd want for your exit from a theme park it's pitch black down here let's install some lights that's better yep just walk towards the light stay on the path nothing Bad's gonna happen to you oh wait sorry no I got that confused I meant there's something coming for you I guess I forgot to mention these three rollercoasters I have set up but hey some people make it through and some people don't don't worry though those people aren't dead actually they're very much alive but naturally their journey continues on a different path starting with these mystical stairs okay so here's what I've learned about people in this game all these people keep going because they know eventually this path will take them back to the beginning which says to me so long as this path takes them to the exit eventually they will keep walking but hey let's test these limits more than getting hit by a roller coaster ever could give them something everybody enjoys a lot of cardio a whole hell of a lot of cardio okay all you brave people three things I want you to consider while you walk up this stairway one there's no railing so watch your step two don't forget that this is still happening and there's some people that are gonna clear that wall so you know maybe don't look to the right and three I've made a great discovery it turns out you can have these TV screens and you can even import your own graphics and videos so I went ahead and made a couple of my own signs you know to motivate people so we'll go ahead and put this one right at the beginning now like there's this many steps but you know you gotta keep people motivated and halfway up you're probably feeling a little winded so let's make sure your motivation is nice and high yes hooray for cardio and let's head up to our final sign that's way up at the top here it's always important to do a wellness check from time to time how many broken bones do I have it's gonna be especially important as we go down this nice lovely uneventful catwalk hey speaking of cats why don't we put a roller coaster up here one right out of my fever dreams hello nightmares would you like to terrorize these people with me yeah go get them yeah this will teach you come on it's really your own fault if this thing gets you coming at you at point-o one miles per hour so scary-looking that said a lot of people are still getting through so I feel like we're gonna have to up the stakes a little bit we are you all in for a surprise it's everyone's favorite the log ride there you go head on down the river to collect your victims I mean really the giant waterslide should be kind of a dead giveaway for people but hey sometimes you're just too into the surroundings but since a lot of you were still getting through let's go ahead and set up coaster number three whatever the hell this is I for one can't wait for this living nightmare to start moving it everybody don't be alarmed there's just a UH oh my god oh my god it just keeps coming wow that's an aggressive roller coaster isn't it I'm just saying people probably want to move from that spot I told you my soft human body well I think between these three we've managed to make sure most people don't survive the catwalk I've got some good news though these people aren't just falling to their death oh they go somewhere very different I'm actually set up a nice little contraption to catch them don't worry I'll explain first we catch the people and then they get strained through this slot actually through multiple slots before getting funneled down here then we just follow them down sure we lose a couple but most of them make it then they all get dumped down into this little compartment right here it couldn't be more simple careful protect your spine and vital organs now you might be wondering where is here exactly well you see I don't feel like they've been launched enough so I've created a new delivery system if you will I figured why not build them something special like firing them out of a giant shotgun that's right it's an old double-barrel what's the matter you haven't seen a double-barrel shotgun rollercoaster before that's okay I'm pretty sure these people haven't either who knew their fantastic journey would end here as ammo for this and if you're wondering how this works look no further than these two guys over here first these two launched at the same time each one gathering speed and diving directly into the ground at which point it literally goes into the earth scoops up into the gun and if all goes according to plan something magical will happen meanwhile while people are wandering down the tubes they're basically putting themselves into position for these things to launch them as far as possible and if all goes according to plan we're gonna have a nice little shotgun baby okay it looks like we got plenty of buckshot lined up excuse me voluntary participants okay let's give this a shot haloed has been deployed so far so good well that went better than expected honestly my only complaint is it just flies off into the distance all these people get to survive on nice soft grass so let's see if we can't do something about that all right here we go I got just the thing look I don't care how close we get it as long as someone goes in the hoop yeah nothing but net you know I gotta say I'm really pleased how this is all turning out okay that's great but for you people coming right out of the cannon I got something else for you okay where were we besides the framerate being noticeably worse oh yeah that's right nothing but pro shots over here luckily though now we have some plans for where these people go next down here into my beautiful volcano where the brimstone is fresh in the frame rates are sparse has everyone dealing at this you okay don't forget if these people are here that means that they've survived not one not two not three but four catapulting x' and now they have to deal with being in lava and I had to deal with these frame rates what I'm saying is these people have most definitely earned a way out you see these two brave souls right here they found their way to the secret exit there you go families come on out of that hellscape and glitchy graphics and back-end it there you are look at you and if they somehow find their way through these dark dark corridors believe it or not there actually is a way out and it actually takes you to the beginning of the park congratulations you've actually earned your freedom I mean kinda you do have to brave all the roller coasters again but provided you can do that without getting hit you can go home Oh too bad well better luck next time who knows maybe you'll get lucky this time yeah just walk on top of that kid and that's the circle of life for you well I hope you had fun I know I did I give this game 206 out of two hundred and six broken bones as well as three subway cars waiting to ambush you in a dark passage an honorable mention of cardio and an a-plus for the game providing me with limitless ammunition so thanks for watching and I'll see you next time",16:06
W12vb_Crf00,OverSimplified,"Comedy,Informative",Football War - MiniWars #2,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W12vb_Crf00,4 years ago,14M views,"Comedy,Informative","Quick, you have two seconds to name these two countries You're wrong! Unless you got it right Then good job! They are of course Honduras and El Salvador One thing these two countries have in common is being fanatic about Football Or if you're a freedom-loving patriot , Soccer But do they love it so much, they would go to war over it? You bet they would And that is NO BUENO If you look at these two countries you might notice one major difference, and that is that this one is a lot bigger than this one However, this one had a larger population than this one, made up mostly of farmers And there wasn't enough land for them to live and work on, so they started moving from El Salvador to Honduras in search of land And by the 1960s a huge number of illegal immigrants had crossed over the border from El Salvador Meanwhile in Honduras, it's 1963 and this guy has just staged a military coup to prevent the rise of Communism And is now the military leader of the country He immediately began harassing the peasants' unions and other left-wing groups But he's a little insecure about the legitimacy of his leadership, so he holds an election and wins But then the opposing party says, ""Hey man, that election was clearly corrupt and fraudulent And also you've been bribed by the rich American banana companies who are taking all of our bananas tax-free And now our economy is in ruins"" And everyone started to get mad at him Now if you ever find yourself the barely legitimate military leader of a corrupt Central American country and you start getting into hot water Here's a bit of advice that has been tried and tested throughout the centuries Blame something else So he blamed the Salvadoran immigrants for stealing all the land and all the jobs and ruining Honduras The immigrants found themselves under attack by the hostile locals Egged on by the rich American banana companies who wanted all the bananas to themselves The Honduran government began evicting Salvadoran immigrants Who had been living on the land for generations And started sending them back to El Salvador The Salvadoran elite were furious and protested, citing moral reasons But in reality, they were just getting a little too crowded So tensions were about as high as they could be, but then FOOOOTBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALL It's the 1970 World Cup qualifiers and both countries finished top of their qualifying tables So it's now time for them to play against each other in a series of matches The first match took place in Honduras The night before the game, Hondurans gathered outside the Salvadoran team's hotel making noise and taunting them The next day, Honduras defeated the exhausted Salvadorans with a late 90th minute goal After the match, a young Salvadoran fan, unable to bear her country's defeat, shot herself Disturbingly, the Salvadoran government glorified the incident and made her into a national hero And at the next game, fans brought pictures of her to the stadium Emotions were running high as the next match took place in El Salvador and this time the tables were turned The Hondurans had to endure a sleepless night in their hotel And the next day, before the match started, instead of the Honduran flag, the Salvadorans raised a dirty rag So great job at reducing tensions El Salvador won decisively over the exhausted Hondurans While spectators battled in the stands, team Honduras fled home in a bulletproof bus with rocks being thrown at them And the Honduran coach reportedly told his players that they were lucky they lost In response to the defeat Hondurans began terrorising the Salvadoran settlers even more In some cases reportedly throwing them off their land and burning down their homes And the immigrants began fleeing back to El Salvador The final game in Mexico would decide who went to the World Cup It was close But El Salvador came out victorious, knocking Honduras out of the tournament The atmosphere was riotous, literally And back in Honduras attacks on the Salvadoran immigrants further increased This was too much for El Salvador to bear, with its people under attack And an unmanageable refugee crisis on its hands El Salvador severed all diplomatic ties with Honduras and declared WAR The Football War is also known as the 100 Hours War because that's how long it lasted Making it one of the shortest wars in history El Salvador started by carrying out air raids in strat egic locations within Honduras Including Toncontin International Airport Which prevented the Honduran Air Force from getting into the sky Then, with their superior army, they began an invasion along two major roads complete with light tanks and infantry Their advance was rapid and they were quickly approaching the Honduran capital Then the Organization of American States met in a bit of a panic And unanimously agreed that war between El Salvador and Honduras Was a bad thing and probably shouldn't continue So they went to El Salvador and said, ""can you please stop invading?"" And El Salvador declared, ""NOT UNTIL THEY STOP BEING JERKS!!!!"" And so the war went on The Honduran Air Force finally got into the sky And with aid from neighboring Nicaragua They successfully carried out air raids in Salvadoran air bases and oil facilities Crippling the Salvadoran supply line and stopping their advance dead Caught in a bit of a stalemate, the situation was no longer advantageous to El Salvador So when the Organization of American States once again asked them to stop and agreed to ensure the safety of the Salvadoran immigrants El Salvador relented and a ceasefire was organized on the 18th of July Then the OAS said, ""can you now please withdraw your troops from Honduras?"" ""No"" - ""Please""
- ""No"" - ""Please""
- ""No"" - ""Please""
- ""No"" ""Do it or we'll sanction you"" ""You know what?"" ""Just for you"" ""I'll do it"" So El Salvador pulled its troops out of Honduras on the 2nd of August and with casualties in the thousands, The war was over The economies of both nations were damaged by the war And El Salvador didn't have the capability to take care of all the returning immigrants A crisis that eventually helped cause a civil war The war left behind land and border disputes Some of which are still a cause of tension to this day El Salvador went on to play in the World Cup, but lost every match they played And didn't make it past the group stage So in the end nobody achieved anything and there were no winners Except for this guy",5:36

m-Ob3aq-wrg,TechLinked,"Tech,News","Intel's first GPU is ""Super Okay!""",1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-Ob3aq-wrg,,977K views,"Tech,News","- Knock knock. - [James] Who's there? - Tech news. - [James] I should have seen that coming. - Just tech news! So gaming laptops and portability have never exactly gone hand in hand. But, Intel thinks it
might have the solution as details of its new Iris Xe MAX mobile GPUs recently dropped. - [Announcer] Intel's first
discreet graphic solution for thin and light laptops. - Unlike the standard Iris Xe, this is actually a discreet GPU that Intel is marketing
to both content creators and casual gamers who don't
wanna lug around a heavy laptop. Intel seemed particularly proud of something called, Deep Link, which is a form of machine learning that can intelligently load balance between an integrated and discreet GPU to increase performance and battery life. As far as actual frame rates, Intel is saying that Xe MAX
will get in the range of 30 to 45 frames per second at 1080p, in a number of modern AAA titles. If you turn the settings down a bit. So, it's not revolutionary, but it looks, okay enough, considering that Intel
is going to be launching a higher performance
gaming chip next year, which will hopefully show up in laptops, and hopefully not heat the bezel up to fry an egg temperatures. If you're just desperate at this point, to get your hands on any graphics card from
the RTX 3000 series, there might be even more
bad news on the horizon. There's a rumor, and we want to clarify, it's
just a rumor at this point, that the RTX 3060 Ti has been pushed back a couple of weeks, from November 17th to December 2nd. Again, take this with a grain of salt because Nvidia hasn't
even officially confirmed that there is a 3060 Ti at all. But it's hard to imagine team
green would wait too long to release a more mid range chip. Performance is speculated to be somewhere around the level of the
last gen RTX 2080 Super for less than $400, which would make it a pretty
compelling deal, if it's true. And if you could buy one
before the bots get to them all and they're on eBay for $900. For those of you in the UK, you probably know that
the country is preparing for a second pandemic lockdown
that's supposed to start this Thursday Unsurprisingly, this has
left many gamers concerned about important things like, what's gonna happen to their
PS5 and X-Box series pre-orders as both consoles are due
to launch mid-November. - [James] Drone delivery. - Because the lockdown is (mumbles) that would work. Because the lockdown is supposed to last until at least early December, people have been concerned that they may not get
their consoles, in time. But one major retailer has told consumers they still have until Wednesday
night to pre-order in store. And the UK government has said that businesses can stay
open for delivery and pickup, even for non-essential items like console, what do you mean, non-essential items? You know, might be essential if you review games for a living. - [James] Or play them--
- Or are bored. - [James] for fun. - [Linus] Today's bit
quits are brought to you by the Seasonic Prime Ultra
Titanium PC Power Supply. It's the creme de la
creme of power supplies with ultra high efficiency, 80 plus titanium rating, fully modular interface and, it comes with a power supply tester, which is super useful
if you're tryna do like, custom cooling or whatever. You even get a fan with
a fluid dynamic bearing and hybrid fan control
to keep the noise down. With a 50,000 hour life expectancy backed by a 12 year warranty, what are you waiting for? Other than the price, it's not cheap. But if you got money, you can buy it at the link below. Onto the bit quits. Speaking of money, Bitcoin seems to be
continuing its recovery from the infamous crash
that it had experienced a couple of years ago that
I'm still reeling from. This weekend, Bitcoin got up
to about 14,000 US dollars, it's highest value since January of 2018. Although there's been a surge in interest in cryptocurrency recently, it isn't clear why Bitcoin
specifically is doing so well. Just whatever you do,
don't pay 10,000 Bitcoin for a pizza like that one guy did way back in the day. Ouch, right? (mumbling in background) Facebook is finally rolling out a test of a dark mode feature
on both Android and iOS. Trials so far have been extremely limited, which has frustrated many users since most other oft
used social media apps have some sort of dark mode already. Better late than never, Mark. - [James] His soul is dark enough already. - The original Crysis has
already gotten a remake. And now it sounds like remasters of both Crysis Two and
Three are in the works. It's not clear how long it might be until we actually see them, since even the Crysis One remaster was delayed by about seven
months, which wasn't enough. And it will be interesting
to see how the games look especially Crysis Three which is still sometimes used as a benchmark and is pretty good looking. - [James] Crysis Three-mastered! - Like, are they just tryna make them hard to run on purpose at this point? If you were looking to
slap a custom face plate on your shiny new
PlayStation Five, by the way, prepare to be disappoint. As Sony has ordered a
third-party manufacturer to stop making them. Reportedly Sony's lawyers told them, that Sony owned the IP
rights to the face plates. Now, it's unclear why a licensing deal wasn't just worked out. Could be the usual corporate greed or, maybe the face plates have some kind of undisclosed chip in them. - [James] First-party plates. - Or maybe the third-party ones just suck. And Sony thinks that only they know how to face plate it right. Whatever the reason is, you can't get one right now. And, heads up. There's another Apple event
scheduled for the 10th, which is a week from, tomorrow. It's online only but it's still expected to
be a major announcement, as most outlets are speculating, that it will be the unveiling of the new Apple Silicon Macs. As usual, Apple is
officially mum on details, but we all know what's coming. It's kinda like how you
should never be surprised that anything happens in professional
wrestling, for example. Although that whole thing where they aren't letting them
go on Twitch anymore. That was sort of, dirt
baggy and surprising. - [James] Even their news got news. - Yeah, that sucked. That's our show, come back Wednesday, where we elbow drop y'all
with some more tech news. The people's tech news elbow! (glass shattering)
Oh God!",6:03
F0LNbWM-Hno,Hardware Canucks,Tech,Logitech G915 Lightspeed Keyboard Review - Who Would Buy This?,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0LNbWM-Hno,2 years ago,1.3M views,Tech,"I don't know is it just me or a gaming
keyboards becoming way too expensive definitely not just me what's up guys
I'm Dimitri's harken accent today we have a really interesting keyboard from
Logitech that g915 lightspeed Wireless I feel like Logitech is setting the new
standard for what the low-profile keyboard should be in terms of the bass
in terms of the switches and the key caps and they've done a lot of things
right with this board and despite my favoritism towards tkl boards you know
because this thing is absolutely massive I don't like that form factor but many
people do in terms of our Twitter poll as you can see here majority of people
prefer still full-size gaming ports for gaming and also an interesting fact the
sales for full-size boards versus TTL are like 90 percent for a full sized
board from Logitech so it makes sense for them to focus on larger boards that
people will actually buy instead of catering towards the really loud
minority that want ekl including myself and I am hoping that we'll see a
low-profile tql version of this but right now
full-size makes sense in terms of what large Tech's selling and what are people
requesting oh there we go this is the excel I'm looking for
welcome the O 11 excel by Liam Lee stepping it up with upgrades all around
for enthusiasts builds with perfect radiator spacing in the bottom on the
side and the top with now a slightly wider main chamber for taller GPUs and
rear exhaust area the second chamber will hide all your cables and house hot
swappable drives for a complete package all around this is the 11 excel by
Bailey giving you room to grow as you guessed it based on the intro the price
point I would say is the caveat and would be the main turnoff from the
mainstream consumer market because of $250 it's expensive the g8 5 which is
the wired version is $199 and has a USB pass-through port and is not wireless so
the wireless convenience is the $50 premium now I want to focus my attention
on the low profile nature of something like this because they've done a
fantastic job in terms of minimizing the actual frame size at the bottom and that
is because of the new GL switches they come in three flavors the
linear the tactile and the clicky as you can see in this shot here we have the
low profile switch on the right and height differences pretty significant
versus your standard mechanical switch on the left and that is what allows them
to create something that profile like the G915 or G815
these have been co-developed with kale and it's great to have three variations
of this type of switch right at the start but kale also has their own
variations of the switch that will hopefully see more widely available in
other keyboards to this whole low profile movement is starting to grow as
for the specs they all have a 50 gram actuation force 1.5 millimeter actuation
point and 2.7 million or travel distance and that for a low profile keyboard is
pretty incredible for your tactile and clicky switches it feels really nice
while on the linear switch I'm almost expecting for it to be a little bit more
travel distance because I'm guessing I'm used to that as for the actual based on
the keyboard it is thinner than my iPhone with a case on it which is pretty
incredible I do like the aluminum frame and the little curved side lines but the
edges of the frame are really sharp so if you're doing any flicks just be
careful with the thumbs because it might be painful now some of you may be
thinking what's the point of a low profile keyboard when the bass and the
actual footprint is so large and I agree with you in comparison to my ducky 1/2
SF like this thing is like more than 2x2 size and that's pretty much because we
have additional G keys on the left side we have five them so you can record
macros and stuff and the actual forehead of the keyboard is pretty tall to
accommodate those additional keys like your profile switches your macro key the
connectivity and the lighting and the gaming key and just to give you a
comparison how thin the keyboard is here is next to the ducky 1/2 SF which is
pretty low profile in my opinion and here it is next to the apex Pro which is
like the larger and taller but we do have two height adjustments on the G915
and it puts it in the same height where the
back is to like your standard mechanical keyboard it does give you a nice high
elevation toe for typing when it's completely flat it almost like feels
like it's built into the desk but when you've raised it on that maximum level
it gives you a nice angle of adjustments and typing it's nice also because of
this you do not need the wrist rest because the bottom keys are so low to
the desk that when they were trying to see if you need the wrist rest it would
actually cause you fatigue and discomfort so the desk is your wrist
rest I do like the dedicated media controls on the right side plus a very
smooth volume wheel that has no tactility whatsoever and it seems like
there's a bit of delay between when you actually touch the volume wheel and when
that volume appears on-screen and windows and you can play around with it
and see the volume wheel catching up to whatever you set it to
as for the key caps they're incredibly low profile and that is the third point
that made the whole low profile nature of this keyboard so good the frame the
switch and the key cap many of you probably expecting pvt key caps for this
price point they're not however they're extremely solid and sturdy
there's no flex whatsoever we have the main key that is shine through and it's
beautiful nation because of the LED that is right underneath it however the
second characters are not shine through therefore they're left blank which is
kind of nice because there is no gradient in the illumination the issue
with the key caps over is that they're almost proprietary and finding
replacements is not easy especially right now with this whole early movement
of low profile keyboards and the switches in particular and unfortunately
I broke one of the legs on the key cap when I was inserting it back into the
switch very gently I heard a snap my god no and unfortunately the N key is now
super wobbly has no stability whatsoever without one of the legs on it
interestingly large stick tells me they've never had one break in their own
internal testing so that's kind of interesting and if that happens to you
if you are replacing key caps or like removing them for cleaning or something
that they do have support to send out replacement keys that you can purchase
yourself just keep that in mind by the way I love the font super clean nice
boldness this is the way forward for gaming boards he also tell us they have
a special coating on top of the key caps to prevent them from wearing out the top
layer because of finger oils I'll keep you guys updated in a few
from now make sure to follow us on social media so the lighting is
absolutely beautiful super bright vibrant color accurate to what you set
the software which is awesome and my only complaint here would be the m12 m3
keys which are your profiles and they are set to yellow and they're constantly
yellow and they don't correspond to user set color you power on the keyboard with
a switch in the top left you charge it with a mic USB port and top right
no type-c however and the battery life on this thing is absolutely insane
you're looking about 1200 hours of continuous usage without any lighting on
and the lighting here of course is the culprit for killing battery life at full
brightness you're looking about 30 hours of continuous usage or like you know a
full week on normal basis we do have the brick with a low profile USB receiver
that has the G 9:15 text on it which is great and when you need to charge your
simply unplug the cable plug it into a keyboard and the whole system is
designed for that receiver to remain somewhere in the vicinity of the
keyboard because when you need that microUSB cable you can simply plug it in
so the wireless aspect is super fantastic especially for keyboard that
large not having a cable to worry about is great of course that comes with the
price but we also have a Bluetooth mode for connecting to other devices
connected to my iPhone literally without any issues so I can switch between
Bluetooth and 2.4 gigahertz on my computer without any issues with a
simple click of a button I do like that we have a macro key on the keyboard
itself so you click that you select which G key you want first you type in
your command and you click the macro key in once again to record that macro to
the G key super simple on-the-fly macro recording without needing the software
and speaking of the software I really enjoy G Hub nice and simple UI
navigation in terms of setting your presets or customizing your lighting /
key and key assignments we can further customize what those G macro Keys do and
then the game mode interestingly you can disable other keys outside your windows
key in case you accidentally constantly pressing them and you don't want to have
them be registered in game this is something you can do now and so the
keyboard and it's full state I feel like is a really good low profile example on
the market in terms of the frame the switches the key caps I don't appreciate
the large form factor I'd like it to be smaller to complement the whole compact
but that's just my bias let me know if you agree my only complaint here with
the key cap legs where one of them broke and I don't know how I was very gentle
with it and the replacements are not easily found and the volume wheel man
this thing is just it doesn't have any tactility to it and there's that weird
lag in Windows I do appreciate the game mode and disabling certain keys outside
of your Windows key and the only thing that I don't like about the frame are
the really sharp corners because of the aluminum frame and where it meets that
plastic frame as well I wish that was rounded instead of the side lines being
rounded in terms of the switches I love the tactile and the clicky for gaming
the clicking one in particular it feels like a softer Razer green switch the
clicky point is soft but it's very pronounced while the Browns feel really
nice as well I'm just really used to browns while the
linear I feel like for my game style I prefer to have a bit more travel
distance for linear switch for my game style but it's nice to have all three
flavors available the new Hydra X series from Corsair is a full water cooling
ecosystem with transparent blocks for RGB goodness and built-in flow
indicators with soft and heart tubing available and the full array of fittings
so you can design the perfect loop for you hide your X by Corsair everything is
linked below and so it really comes down to whether or not you want such a
low-profile keyboard that is also massive it's kind of like a catch-22 but
hopefully more custom keycaps will be available in the market that you can
swap these out in case they break and yeah I'm a Dmitry thanks so much for
watching I am pleased with this one except for it's not from my play style
in terms of being so large but the switches the switches I like thanks so
much for watching make sure to check out this other relevant content I'll see you
guys in the next video you",10:43

Like two wires running parallel to each other or two lovers separated by glass. I Love you, too a capacitor stores energy in form of electric fields. If there is a path to place some charges on one side then it attracts the opposing charges through the other path and charges the other side. Now even if I cut the paths it will hold on to its energy and the first popular capacitor that was made like 300 years ago was called a Leyden jar It has quite a simple structure and I also noticed that the king of random Junior made one and I watch the video and Let's just say I don't appreciate misuse of capacitors That's quite rich coming from me, I guess and thanks to circuit specialists. I'll give away two hand tech scopes at the end I mean 200 megahertz two channel scope for [very low price]. What is your excuse for not scoping curves? Let's make a Leyden jar and explain it I took a plastic bottle for vitamin pills and peel the label off because they thinner the wall the higher the capacity I cover the outside of the bottle with aluminum foil as one side of the capacitor plate. Cut the extras Tape the edges with electric tape There Then we put a metal screw or nail at the center of the lead all the way in so you can get into the water in the bottle later I can't put metal plate on the inside of the bottle so instead I fill it with water which is not conductive and Then add salt to it to make it conductive So now the aluminum on the outside and the conductive saltwater on the inside are the two isolated conductive plates of my Capacitor and now I add some length of metal wire to the end of the screw which will help increase the surface Contact to the saltwater and reduce the resistance. Now, this is pretty much done But the actual Leyden jars have a smooth metal sphere at the end of the rod that removes all the sharp edges where the charges can run away from I don't have a metal sphere But I have a ping-pong ball that I can wrap inside aluminium foil and make it as smooth as possible put the end of it around the screw and Cover the rough surfaces with electric tape and we're done. Let's see if I can measure the capacitance According to the meter the Leyden jar is around one-and-a-half Nanofarads, which is pretty small but it's around what it should be Now King jr Used the PVC pipe and rubbed it with paper towel. PVC picks up negative charge and he charged the bottle like this Which is incorrect. Helping me with the material I need for my video. Thanks King What is wrong? A capacitor is a two terminal component: if charges come in from one side The opposing charges need to get in from the other side. The way King jr. Is doing it it is still getting charged but not as the capacitor it is but as Anything can pick up charge like this PVC pipe the outer Surface likes to become positive because the negative charges on the inside of the bottle repel the electrons on the outer surface But they have nowhere to go until he touches the surface Try grabbing the foil and then touching the nail to see if I get a shock Oh? I got a shock just from the foil That's not how it's normally supposed to go But so now the jar has a chance to give out some of its electrons to King Junior's body and become positive while King jr becomes more negatively charged now when he touches the center of the Leyden jar The discharge is not too great because both the center and his body are charged negatively and the remaining energy dissipates through his body. There was a little bit. Oh, a little bit of a shock. Let me show you how to do it properly The outer surface is connected to earth which is also connected through this wire to my body and grounds my body I hold the towel in one hand like this and Rub the PVC pipe against it while passing it over the center of the Leyden jar like this now when I do this the PVC pipe picks up negative charges and places them at the center of the Leyden jar which repels the Electrons on the outer surface into Earth the towel becomes positive So it sucks electrons from earth through my body and becomes neutral again So next time when I pass the PVC through it it can send more charges through. It's basically like I am pumping charges into the capacitor [gets shocked] I'll have to hold my hand a little bit further This is very much the same way a Van de Graaff machine works. Do you hear the charges going in? Okay, let's see if it picked up any charge. [gets shocked more intensely] I forgot to unground myself That was painful No more touching with hand. I made another grounded ball to discharge it. Let's try the different number of strokes I made it darker too, so you can see the arc Okay ten strokes Yeah a little bit. That looked like a one kilovolt discharge Here's 20 strokes Not bad was probably around five kilo volts and here's 50 strokes Wow that was strong maybe around 10 kilovolts Okay hundred strokes Whoa-ho-ho That was like fifteen sixteen kilovolts. And then the King junior tried to charge his Leyden jar using one of those plasma globes Which is very much the same as a Tesla coil, and that wont work either nothing Nothing whatsoever the reason is simple something like a Tesla coil outputs high frequency AC arcs while a Capacitor shorts AC so there wouldn't be any charge buildup on the capacitor Now I want to see how much current it can send through my body So I'm gonna use a one ohm shunt resistor in series with my body so every volt is one amp and twenty strokes or around five kilo volts and measure across the shunt using my scope Okay, twenty strokes, of course This is not going to be super accurate due to the line inductances and the fast nature of the discharge but we'll see Okay ready [agonized yelp] oh **** Wow, it hurts where it goes in and where it goes out to the ground Of course, this is much worse because it's capacitance is around five times larger than a regular discharge a  human body experiences So the duration of the pulse is much longer and a five kilo volt on this one can hurt as much as twenty five kilo volt of a regular discharge I like King junior or senior. Try this one and if you look at the plot you see there is a faster spike of up to 12 amps through my body and then the current stays around five amps and discharges slowly to zero in around seven microseconds Here's the screenshot if you want to see more accurately. So although the voltage and current are super high I'm saved by the fact that the pulse duration is very short So the energy is limited. If the voltage is high the current is high. Now this capacitor works but it's a piece of junk. Why? Because every capacitor has an equivalent series resistance or ESR that we try to minimize But this guy has a huge one. The huge ESR contributor of this Leyden jar is the awful conductivity of salt water if I [gets zapped] [curses] Forgot to discharge the damn thing. Let's open it. Now if I measure the resistance between the salt water and the top ball Around three to four kilo-ohms. It's huge compared to regular capacitors with milli-ohm ESR. Now I want to make a high voltage high-capacity low ESR capacitor and for that I bought this which is a desk cover made of ""material"" I suppose it's some sort of mylar or something I cut two sheets out of it and hopefully there are no punctures on it Otherwise the high voltage will always find a way and arc through and ruin the voltage rating I also cut two sheets of aluminum foil half an inch shorter than the mylar on each side and I'll glue it on the mylar I put some glue on and spread it in a very thin layer Then I stitch my aluminum foil on right at the center And make sure it's completely flat and thin Very nice Then I just tape a piece of flattened wire like this to one corner of this sheet Then I flip it around and glue the next sheet of aluminum right behind the first one Now I tape another wire to the opposite corner of the first wire on the second sheet Okay, we have our basic capacitor, let's measure its capacity At around 5 nano-farad you're already ahead. But now we'll roll this tight this way the layers will overlap multiple times increasing the capacitance much more But now that I think about it rolling it should only bring the outer surface of one Beside the outer surface of the other one. So double the surface area and double the capacitance. Am I wrong? Let's check it. Crap, I totally forgot first I had to put this second layer of mylar. Otherwise, I would short the two layers and now we roll again Ok, let's see what we've got. There you go much smaller than the Leyden jar and it's capacity is around 10 nano farad much more than the Leyden jar and I think it can still do upwards of 10 to 20 kilo volts This will take forever to charge using my PVC pipe though being almost 10 times my Leyden jar if this took 20 strokes to get A decent arc. This will take around 200 Well, I can charge it to 2,000 volts using my microwave transformer through a puny single diode rectifier Let's give it a try Okay, is it charged? Let's see Ouh it is charged! Well not big enough, though I really wish I had a Van de Graaff machine so I could charge it to a million volt or more Maybe I should make one of those [GIVEAWAY TIME] The good people at circuit specialists have provided two hantek scopes to give away to my patrons and viewers I have used this scope briefly before and have seen good feedbacks about it, too So if you are also into scoping curves You can become my patron at patreon.com or sign up from the link in the description for free It is on sale for [very low price].

Pb3AAfz5Yjg,Joma Tech,"Tech,Comedy",Top 3 Programming Languages to Learn in 2019,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb3AAfz5Yjg,2 years ago,1M views,"Tech,Comedy",so most of these top three programming languages videos they always start off by saying it depends because blah blah blah I won't say that I'm just gonna give two so the top three programming languages depends where you're trying to optimize for Wow what a hypocrite anyways this video is sponsored by skill share so I've bucket it into three main categories or like main purposes for learning a new language and I think that encompasses most of you now I want you guys to be honest with yourself because I do think that 95% of you guys who say that you want to go into computer science because it is your passion you are lying to yourselves now that 95 percent they actually care about money the lifestyle or the promise that you'll be able to build a startup that will make you billions now that is totally fine because there's nothing wrong in choosing a career for its financial advantages that is called making informed life decisions but don't lie to yourself be honest because or else you might end up hating what you do but if you're honest with yourself you'll understand the trade-off that you made and you accept the setbacks and the negative outcomes of your life also don't feel bad that you suddenly realize they're lying to yourself I've lied to myself many times I lied to myself saying that I want to be a doctor when I was 13 because it was my passion to help other people get better but obviously as Asians we all know what the true reason we want to be doctors so that we can touch boobies right alright so now that you're honest for yourself put yourself in one of these three camps one I want to program because I want a tech job at a big tech company too I want to program because I want to build web apps fast so that I could make my own product or work for an early startup 3 I want to program so that I could be ahead when I start computer science next year as a freshman I also make one assumption you haven't programmed that much or you are a beginner because I don't think most experienced programmers care about the top languages they know that most languages are kind of similar and what they care about is more about what frameworks or engineering domain they should focus on alright so depending on which camp you're in I'm going to give you the top three programming languages now I'm going to give those to you so that once you start learning stuff that's actually important like engineering domains or frameworks you don't need to relearn these languages so that at least you can get that out of the way for example imagine if your goal was to do machine learning or play with data and fit some models then I would say you should go with Python but learning Python has nothing to do with learning machine learning but it's just that once you get to machine learning most probably you will use the language Python because of the frameworks like pi torch and stuff like that alright so let's start with I want to program because I want a tech job at a big tech company now before we go into that I want to tell you how the recruiting process works at these big tech companies you have three stages right the first one is to get an interview and then the second stage is to pass the interview and then the third stage is to do well in your job aka not get fired ask yourself what is my limiting factor is it that I can't get the interviews or is it that I can't pass the interviews or is it that once I get the job I'm not doing very well and I don't like it so think of it as a funnel and understand what your limiting factor is and then work on that if your resume is not picked up by d interviewer then it doesn't matter how great of a software engineer you're because you're never gonna get to that bottom of the funnel you're never gonna get to start working then there's no chance for you to show off your awesome software engineering skills that's just how life is unfortunately so if your limiting factor is not being able to get interviews then that means you have to work on your resume and if you'll have to work on your resume it means you have to have work experience there but you can't have work experience if you've never gotten a job so the alternative is getting referrals and in combination having good personal projects for your resume however if your problem is that you can't pass the interviews then that means you just have to up your data structure and algorithm skills and that means Li coding especially for these big tech companies because that's what they test you on if your problem is that you can't do your job well once you get in there then most of the time it's not because there are technical abilities but it's more about your resourcefulness and how independent I am kind of skills alright so here's the top three languages for beginners who want to eventually get into a big tech company doing a tech job so number one Python number two Java and number three C++ these three languages are the best for big tech companies during coding interviews and that is what you should be optimizing for if you have to put time into one thing then I strongly recommend that thing to be leak coding many people have been able to get into jobs like Facebook or Google just by being good at solving these leak code questions even though some of them might not even know what git is or build files are crazy now for interviews I think using Python is your best bet because it is not typed you don't need to do memory management and there are a lot of shortcuts that make it easier for you to code during your interview and that is extremely important because each line of code if you save about one or two seconds that adds up to a lot and also you don't need to use your brain to think about the syntax or particular language stuff so that you have more time or more space in your brain to think about the actual problem itself Python is also really good because many of the web frameworks like Django and flask are in Python and these frameworks are really good for you to make personal projects and these projects will translate well into your resume to get interviews I put Java and C++ there because I guarantee you that a big tech company at least one part of their system is written in Java or C++ C++ is usually used for more complex systems when performance is really important Java less so but it's a great language to build applications like for example LinkedIn uses it to sigmah uses it Palantir uses it now yes I put Java and C++ below Python but they do have one thing over Python your curriculum at school is probably using Java or C++ most universities I don't think they will teach in Python because Python is not a great language to learn fundamentals like types or you know building and compiling and memory management you don't need that in Python so that's why they preferred not to teach those things in Python because python is an interpreted language if you don't understand what that means don't worry about it because eventually you will that's how we learn stuff we just hear we just hear a lot of things that gets repeated to us and over time we connect the dots and then we realize oh that's what I meant Python Java and C++ have tremendous support in lis code usually when they give you answers or solutions to the problems they give it to you in these three languages yeah so then I put C++ below Java because C++ is a very wordy language and that's gonna slow you down during interviews so that's why C++ is at third place all right so if your goal is to build stuff like build web applications and build them fast and have fun with them then I think the top three programming languages are JavaScript Java and Swift this might be a little bit controversial but I'll explain it later now if you're like you javascript is a trash language shut up stop recursion tating what you've read on the internet and have your own opinions for Christ's sakes before I explain why I chose these programming languages let me explain how web apps are built you have a front-end and then you have your business logic in your back-end and then you have storage for your data that is usually how web apps are formed to reiterate you have the front end that displays to your users and then you have the back end that decides what to display depending on your data that you have and then you also have storage to store your data for example if you're making online tic-tac-toe then the front-end you display the grid for the players to interact with and then the backend you have the logic of saying oh if that's the case he wins if that's the case she wins if that's the case that's a draw and then on the data storage side you store in memory or whatever the state of the game all right so now that you understand front-end and back-end of a web app let me explain to you why I think JavaScript is number one and also why I said that my list was a little bit controversial now I think my list is a little bit controversial because python is not in there python is extremely popular for building backends for web applications lamp stack was very popular back then laughs is Linux Apache my sequel and PHP and then PHP got replaced by Python over time and Python became very very popular so a lot of frameworks like Django and flask made a popular I actually use Django a lot back when I was in college I built a website called porn Dora but that's a story for another time so yes Python was really popular but then Google released their v8 engine and then also concurrently nodejs came along which is a runtime environment for JavaScript that caused a bunch of web frameworks for JavaScript to pop up for example express especially because these web frameworks were so new they were built with scale in mind older frameworks didn't anticipate the scale that we would be operating at so they're at a disadvantage compared to the newer sexier frameworks that optimizes on throughput and scalability because of their event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous IO so using nodejs as your back-end is extremely popular for pet projects or even startups now you know tinder uses nodejs for their back-end if you know what I mean knob I'm serious they actually use node.js at what's great about JavaScript is that it's also good for front-end now you know websites its built in HTML CSS and JavaScript and then also front-end frameworks and libraries you have react and angularjs in addition even for mobile apps you now have react native where you can build iOS app and Android app by using JavaScript nodejs or I mean javascript is the only language that you can solely use to build a whole app and to end all right next I put Java and Swift the reason why I put Java and Swift is because for mobile development you need Java for Android and then you need Swift for iPhones so as you can see I never really talked about the specifics or the features of a language if you are watching this videos I highly doubt that you would care about the intricacies of a programming language what you should care is how much support you have on the internet for that language or purpose you're trying to accomplish for example C++ is a great language to build performing systems but if you want to do data stuff there isn't that much popular support for data frame style libraries so it's a crappy language if you want to do data stuff now on the other hand R is a great language for numerical computation but if you want to build web applications for it I don't think you have that much support because it's just not that popular to use art to build web applications I'm pretty sure someone made a web application framework but if there aren't that many people who use it then there isn't that much support for it and then every time you're gonna Google something you're not gonna find the answer so before you jump into a language and build a web app what you should do is that you should build a small project and then Google your way through your answers and then if you could see that Wow every time I google something I get an answer right away on Stack Overflow then it means this language has a lot of support and you should use it but if not then not so much and then once you find that that language is probably the best for your use case because you have the support of the whole internet all right now for the final bucket for you people who want to get ahead before starting computer science as a freshman from what I understand what I said before is that they usually use Java or C++ for their courses for me when I was in Waterloo the first programming language they taught us in was something called scheme which was a functional programming language and then later on they taught us using C not C++ C because they wanted to teach us memory management so that we understand the fundamentals of memory more and then later on we used C++ so that we learned about object-oriented programming and then depending on your electives you could usually use whatever you want whatever that gets the job done but mostly they make you use Java or C++ things that require high performance you usually want a language that you could compile into binary and then run it so for example C++ is a very popular choice for graphics and then C is a also very popular choice for low-level things so usually in OS classes or embedded systems classes you're going to be using C I personally like C++ more just because I think once you learn the language and the fundamentals of it it's pretty easy to port over other languages but that's just my opinion but anyways that's pretty much it thank you for listening peace out thank you so much Skillshare for sponsoring this video

4GCO9k1FKaE,The Infographics Show,Informative,Why Winning The Lottery Is The Worst Thing That Can Happen To You,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GCO9k1FKaE,3 years ago,9.3M views,Informative,"No doubt you’ve all had the conversation
with your friends about what you would do if you won the lottery. How much would you give away to family and
friends- how many problems might that cause?. Or would you just spend, spend, spend, and
live a life of selfish luxury? According to CNN Money the biggest lottery
win ever was $1.586 billion, but it was divided between three people. A year later in 2017, one woman scooped $758.7
million and she decided to take the lump sum of $480.5 million. If you don’t know, you can take your win
divided over a number of years or all at once. Sounds great, but tell us what you think about
that after this episode of the Infographics Show, When winning the lottery was a horrible
curse. You may have already seen the documentaries,
in which lottery winners find themselves surrounded by cunning relatives and friends suddenly
emerging from the past, all wanting a piece of the pie. You will know how it can tear families apart,
which often sounds like a tale of biblical greed. These are sad stories for sure. The last one might even bring a tear to your
eye. 10: Return of the killer lover
Aged 42, Doris Murray must have thought she was the luckiest woman alive when she picked
up $5 million after winning the Georgia lottery in 2007. It’s said her plan was to start a trust
fund for her grandchildren. But Murray only got to live with her winnings
one year as her ex-boyfriend came back on the scene begging. She wasn’t interested in getting back with
him or sharing cash with him, and so he stabbed her to death. He was arrested soon after. A lose-lose situation, which we will see is
often the case with lottery greed. 9: A murderer in the family
A guy called Jeffrey Dampier had a similar fate, except this time it was family with
blood on their hands. 39-year old Dampier was over the moon when
he won $20 million in 1996, and it’s reported that he wasn’t stingy, either, treating
family and friends with his cash. His sister-in-law and her boyfriend got the
idea to take Dampier’s winnings and together they kidnapped him and then shot him in the
head. The pair were soon arrested. Dampier’s widow was later asked what winning
the lottery had done for her husband. “I think it is a curse,” she replied. 8: Don’t trust anyone
In 2009 a man with a great name, Abraham Shakespeare, won $30 million in the Florida lottery when
he was 42-years old. The former laborer didn’t spend big at first,
buying just a Nissan Altima and a Rolex watch. According to reports he was constantly harassed
by people who wanted some of his cash. He once told his brother, “I'd have been
better off broke. I thought all these people were my friends,
but then I realized all they want is just money.” And it got worse. He went missing and was later found buried
under someone’s backyard. The killer was a woman he’d befriended who
had told him she’d help him with his too-much money problems. Her name was Dorice ""Dee Dee"" Moore, and she’s
currently serving a long prison sentence for first degree murder. 7: Drinking to the grave
It’s happened numerous times, when winners have been murdered for their money. All the reports of this happening were in
the USA, but self-destruction, well, that’s universal. Take the case of Brit, Keith Gough, who won
£9 million (about $12 million at today’s rates) in 2005. Gough got straight down to the business of
spending, betting big on soccer, horse-racing, and apparently drinking himself to oblivion. He wasn’t the brightest of lucky people,
and got scammed out close to a million dollars after giving it to some shady guy to invest. He not only ended up selling everything he
had bought, including racehorses, a top of the line BMW, his executive box at Aston Villa
Football Club and a large country villa, but he got into money troubles. He died of a heart attack, and financial problems
and booze were to blame. His friends said the lottery virtually killed
him. “Winning the money was the worst thing that
happened to him. It's very sad,” said one old friend. 6: Taking your own life
Then there’s the story of Billie Bob Harrell, who won $31million in the Texan lottery in
1997. He was followed around like many others by
people with their hands out looking for some of his winnings. He didn’t hide the fact he was rich, though. It got so much for the poor guy that he moved
and changed his phone number. He also made some terrible financial decisions,
and things got worse when he got divorced. It seems it all got too much, and two years
after he won, still with money in the bank, he put a gun to his own head. Prior to taking his own life he said, “Winning
the lottery is the worst thing that ever happened to me.” 5: Losing everything you need
Another case was the curse of Jack Whittaker, a West Virginian who won a staggering $315
million in 2002. He wasn’t too careful with his cash, having
almost half a million stolen from his car where he kept a money-loaded suitcase. He later had another $200,000 stolen in a
similar way. Then he was hit by grief after losing his
granddaughter to a drug overdose, and then her mother- his daughter- died two years later
from a drug overdose. They’d both been spending his fortune for
him. “My granddaughter is dead because of the
money. She was the shining star of my life, and she
was what it was all about for me,” he told the press. Incredibly, years later he said he had nothing
left, and was a daughter and granddaughter down. “I wish that we tore the ticket up,” he
said in an interview. 4: Too much, too young
Over in Scotland a wee lad of 17 called Stuart Donnelly won the lottery in 1997 – not a
good year for lottery winners it seems – and talked about the pressure of being rich. He once told a newspaper that he was scared
to leave the house. “It was very hard to deal with all the attention
I got. I even had people camping outside my house. It put a huge strain on me and my family."" He was found dead in his luxury home when
he was 29. It’s thought he died of natural causes,
but the press speculates the lottery win played a part in his demise. 3: Back to the trailer park
Here’s another story of rags to riches and back to rags. Evelyn Basehore won $3.9 million back in 1985,
but she had a taste for gambling. In 2000 she was back in a trailer park, saying
she’d gambled all her money away. “I won the American dream, but I lost it,
too. It was a very hard fall. It’s called rock bottom,” she said. 2: Thug life
Back in the UK there’s a man by the name Michael Carroll, called a “Lottery Lout”
by the press, which kinda means lottery thug. He even called himself “King of Chavs”. What is a chav? That’s a long story, but we guess you could
say a chav is a young hoodlum, but more of a white trash type of hoodlum. Anyway, this young delinquent won a massive
£9.7million ($12.7 million) in the UK lottery in 2002. At the time of his win, when he was just 19,
he was working as a binman (trash collector) and was still wearing an electronic tag so
the cops could keep an eye on him. Winning didn’t stop him from getting in
trouble with the police. 10 years later and ALL the money was gone,
on what he said was tons of drugs, lots of gambling, and “thousands of prostitutes.” We are not sure how he, or his poor lungs
and brain managed it, but he said he had a $2,300 a day crack cocaine habit. What did he have to say about his rise and
fall? “The party has ended and it's back to reality. I haven't got two pennies to rub together
and that's the way I like it. I find it easier to live off £42 dole than
a million.” Dole means unemployment benefits. He couldn’t get away from crime, or criminals,
either. As his money was running out some blackmailers
slit the throats of five of his dogs and basically ran him out of town, but not before he paid
them over $150,000. 1: A mortal loss
But we’ll leave you with the story of all stories, even though we are not sure you can
call it a curse. In Thailand the lottery is serious business
for many; it’s a way out of poverty for some who don’t have many options in life. People make merit at temples and pray for
the winning numbers. Superstitious folks get exploited by seers
who sell the right numbers; people see winning numbers in dreams, or if someone has, say,
a strange-looking fruit growing in their garden, people will queue to pray to it and hope it
gives them lottery-luck. The numbers might even appear on the license
plates of crashed vehicles. A ghost may even whisper the winning numbers
in someone’s ear. So yeah, it’s serious alright. So serious that in 2018 a man called Jirawut
Pongphan was absolutely delighted when he found out he had the winning numbers for the
lottery and was about to collect $1.8 million. The 42-year-old threw a party and got really
drunk, only to wake up and not be able to find his winning tickets. It’s said he became very depressed after
that and wasn’t even able to work. He then shot himself in the head. His suicide note read, “I'm really sorry,
please don't bully my family, I did win the lottery prize.”. Apparently, the tickets were never found,
and no one claimed the prize. After hearing all this, we guess you are thinking
you’d be totally different. Are we right? How would you deal with the cash explosion
to ensure you didn’t become yet another person cursed by a lottery win? Let us know in the comments!Also, be sure

vqs_0W-MSB0,Fireship,Tech,How a CPU Works in 100 Seconds // Apple Silicon M1 vs Intel i9,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqs_0W-MSB0,8 months ago,1M views,Tech,the central processing unit or cpu is like the engine in your car or the brain in your skull and is like a really fancy calculator used to run the applications on your computer when you write software in a language like javascript or python you're actually writing a set of instructions that will be executed as machine code by a cpu which itself is a carefully crafted piece of metal and silicon that contains billions of tiny transistors or on off switches that represent ones and zeros to perform mathematical calculations a cpu will combine multiple transistors together to form logic gates for example and will take two binary inputs and validate that both are true to produce a true output it only takes a few basic logic gates to solve highly complex computational problems modern chips contain billions of transistors and they can be flipped on and off billions of times per second the state of the cpu is synchronized by an oscillator known as the clock generator in general the more times the clock can pulse per second the faster the cpu can compute and is normally measured in gigahertz gamers will sometimes overclock their cpus to gain more performance at the cost of higher temperatures and a lower life expectancy now in order to run applications it interacts with the system memory or ram in a series of four steps known as the machine or instruction cycle step one is the fetch phase think of a software program as a set of instructions stored in the ram the cpu has registers to temporarily store the address and memory that it wants to interact with the program counter starts at 0 and copies that address to the memory address register then the control unit sends out a signal to copy the data from that address to the instruction register at which point it needs to figure out how to use this instruction in the decode phase the control unit parses the actual bits in the instruction most importantly the opt code contains the instruction like add or subtract and the operand is the address in memory to perform that operation on the final execute stage takes the decoded information and passes it as electrical signals to the relevant parts of the cpu the arithmetic logic unit or alu can perform math on the data and then store the results in ram to change the state of the program the cycle is repeated billions of times per second and modern chips utilize multiple cpu cores to run multiple computations in parallel that's how a cpu works under the hood but there's a lot more you should know about processor architectures if you're a developer and that's why i've invited alex from the most underrated tech channel on youtube to break down some more advanced concepts like apple silicon and how to run performance benchmarking on your own machine hi everybody my name is alex and i'm here to take you beyond 100 seconds in your quest to learn about how processor architectures differ and also how those differences affect our productivity as developers i'll show you what the apple silicon chip and a refrigerator have in common and then i'll share some of my own experiences with using developer tools and build execution on the first generation apple silicon chip called the m1 ship as compared to the intel chip first and foremost i just want to say that my personal productivity as a developer depends less on processors inside my computer and more on how much coffee i had and whether i'm trying to work after a big meal but aside from human factors let's dig deeper into why the new apple silicon machines have been really kicking up a storm and changing the industry software development included and spoiler alert the m1 machines have been beating the intel machines in pretty much every build test i've thrown at it except a couple but it's not all roses so let's talk about some downsides later too so why is it so darn fast the first point i want to discuss is the physicality differences of the new apple silicon way versus the old intel and amd way this is what apple silicon and your refrigerator at home have in common all right imagine for a minute that you want to make a turkey with cheese sandwich you go over to the refrigerator and in one place you have the turkey breast the cheese the mayonnaise the mustard all those ingredients are right there in one place and you don't have to run around the house to gather them you don't have to drive to lots of stores to pick them up and this saves you lots of time and energy this kind of efficiency can be found in the new apple silicon chips because they aren't just a new processor apple silicon is a collection of many chips that are housed inside one silicon container and this type of system is known as a system on chip or sock and it's essentially an entire computer on one chip the main cpu the gpu the i o controller the ml engine they're all co-located so when the task is to make an electronic sandwich so to speak or in other words to do some work that involves all these different components a system on chip is going to be a lot more efficient in terms of energy usage using only a tiny bit of power and at the same time it's going to be faster than say a typical machine that has all the components separate intel based machines have a cpu that's a single chip and memory is located somewhere else on the motherboard the i o is somewhere else the individual components might be even more powerful than the ones available at the moment on the latest apple silicon based machines but that comes at a cost since these powerful components are like supermarkets that carry different sandwich ingredients as a result when you want a sandwich on an intel machine you'll have to drive all over town because one store will have the turkey another store will have the cheese yet another store will have the mayonnaise each store might be really good at their own process and have the best ingredients but each store also takes a lot of power to run losing out on the efficiency and since all you really want is just to make a simple sandwich you're wasting a ton of time and energy picking up the ingredients from all the different stores of course some might say the drawback with the system on chip design is that at least for now with the current selection of apple max you won't be able to upgrade or change any of the components you get what's on the menu and that's it but that's not news to most people that are familiar with the apple ecosystem once you accept that idea you might even see the benefits of having a more efficient design where all the components are on one chip and they outweigh the cons and still provide better performance than the alternative all right that's enough talk about food so how does this all affect real world development workflows so i've been doing a bunch of developer focused tests on the latest apple silicon machines over on my channel as well as comparing them to other machines like the intel max and pc machines too and in general the new design has been showing really great promise for my own workflows as a developer coffee and sandwiches excluded now there are lots of technology stacks that developers use of course and i'm trying builds in a few of them but now let me share some of the results i've seen with node and javascript tests and after that i'll also discuss the tech stacks that have the biggest gains on the new machines and also the stacks that have the biggest losses right now at the moment i started off trying out some existing javascript tests that are in the browser and then in node the browser test consisted of running speedometer which is a browser benchmark that measures the responsiveness of web applications it uses demo web apps to simulate their actions such as adding to-do items you visit the app in a browser of choice i tried chrome and safari for this and you execute the automated test that runs through a collection of applications built with some of the more popular ui frameworks like angular react amber even vanilla js and jquery and a whole bunch more and then this test reports the results as a single number when it's done this number represents the runs per minute and the higher the better when it was finished i found that it had significantly more iterations on the m1 safari had the best results even going off the scale and chrome did pretty well too i also ran some javascript benchmarks in a node environment and found a pretty cpu intensive algorithm called fancook redux that's implemented in javascript and created for benchmarks game a website that collects algorithms and tests in different languages and while my 16-inch macbook pro with the intel core i9 processor did beat the macbook air with the m1 chip it really didn't do so by a lot and when you consider the price differences between the machines and the fact that the m1 stayed cool throughout the test and that the battery hardly even took a hit on the m1 you might be thinking whether the extra few seconds saved while running this benchmark on the intel i9 is really worth the money so running benchmarks is often very telling but it doesn't necessarily line up with real-world scenarios so that's why i also like to conduct my own tests whether using my own projects or other open source projects that are out there and that commenters sent to me and here's what i found i ran a build of the official nativescript plugins repository which is a project based on nx workspaces if you're not familiar with nx workspaces it allows you to scale large javascript and other tech stack projects and you can see the nx quickstart right here on this channel in my test the build that took about three minutes on each machine only differed in build time by tens of seconds with the m1 macbook air beating out the intel macbook pro two out of three times so let's talk about what dev stacks benefit the most from the new apple silicon chips at this time for javascript developers the benefits are already visible however if you're building mobile apps for ios for compiling c plus plus code then this is where you'll see a 40 to 50 percent improvement in build times i ran a few xcode builds and swift builds and i did some c plus plus algorithms and built opencv and webkit in all those tests the m1 came out on top so what devstacks benefit the least so far in my own testing any builds that have to do with running natively built software and building using native tooling has absolutely destroyed intel and speed and battery performance native being compiled for the apple silicon architecture even when running some software via apple's rosetta that's the translation layer that allows you to run intel and amd based x64 and x86 programs on the new apple hardware even some of those software packages ran better than on intel and that's just amazing but there are workflows that aren't ready yet in my opinion if you are an android developer android studio and official android emulators work on apple silicon but they're currently using rosetta for translations and while rosetta is generally pretty good at running x86 targeted code on arm chips it's not enough for the cpu hungry android workflows and i found the results to be not very usable at the moment the latest version of dot net which is version 5 right now isn't fully supported to run on arm simple console applications ran just fine for me but testing any web workflows like asp.net core doesn't work at all yet now it's expected that by the end of this year dot net six will come out it's in alpha right now and we'll have full support for arm until then if you need to develop.net apps i suggest using a pc with windows oh and if you think you can use a virtual windows machine i've tested this as well parallels is the only vendor that currently supports the m1 chip to create a virtual windows environment but the issue is that the windows guest operating system for arm is still quite immature and needs a lot of work also visual studio 2019 the latest visual studio offering from microsoft is unfortunately not compatible with arm at all and my test is not stable even using the built-in windows translation of x64 software to run on arm hardware for game developers that use unity i'm pleased to say that it works surprisingly well on apple silicon via rosetta however it's not as performant as running natively on x86 but by the time you watch this video unity might have a version natively compatible with m1 which i know they're working hard to get out as soon as possible overall apple silicon has really put a boost into many workflows for developers and other professions and eventually even gaming and with the m1 tests we're seeing the improvements with just their entry level machines the upcoming second and third generation apple silicon machines will be even more performant and i can't wait to see that i think it's really gonna help us as developers move to the next level and i think it's just gonna lift up the entire industry to follow the updates on the new apple silicon chips as they relate to us developers as well as seeing me conduct these tests that i've been discussing here consider subscribing to my channel as well the link is down below i'm gonna wrap it up there thanks to fireship for hosting me to share this amazing new world that we're about to enter as developers,12:44
oDYB4ZZLkmY,Incognito Mode,"Blog,Comedy",weapons.,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDYB4ZZLkmY,5 months ago,4M views,"Blog,Comedy",weapons weapons am i good with a weapon yes am i carrying weapons on me always pistols at sunset the bullets don't reach that far aha check out this weapon i just made stay still predator missiles they're working in league with the torpedoes tactical airstrike why what's air supposed to do all this and more on this episode of in the battlefield get it sorry if i sound weird it's because i went to the asian uh supermarket today yeah because we bought some astro turf fake grass yeah i didn't want to take care of it so we astroturfed some of the backyard right it looks like [ __ ] anyway the neighbor's cat has started [ __ ] on the astroturf what am i gonna i can't just kill the neighbor's cab i don't think i can get away with that i didn't want to get into it with their neighbors either excuse me do you know you've got a cat and it shits out like you can't police a cat in the same way that you can adopt that's right the cats are a lore unto themselves so i went to the chinese supermarket right because obviously the thing to do is to buy about three liters of chili oil and then fill a weed sprayer with it and then just start spraying the whole garden in chili oil to the point where it just kind of turns red and then it starts trying to take a [ __ ] and then it goes oh god it turns the grass red or it turns the [ __ ] red and you're hoping that this is gonna like scare the cat something's going wrong here i need to talk to a dog too so you know the grass is looking a lot redder than it usually does wait this is the astro turf so you've essentially just dyed fake grass right yeah pretty much and you know the whole place reeks chili oil and if the cat shits there anyway then boy is he gonna have won this war could you not have just let the [ __ ] continue and no it's an outrageous amount of [ __ ] he's taking like three shits a day like he doesn't even keep it to the sort of back of the property where you wouldn't notice it it's like right on the front that's the first thing a guest would see and then we've got a cat and so people think oh you guys are just [ __ ] dirty why don't you clean up after you said no you don't yeah so anyway that's the reason i went to the asian supermarket and while i was there there was some sour candy that's the full story of why i'm eating sour candy [Music] so you've seen the gay bomb right i've heard of it i'm fascinated by it naturally because it was it was theoretical right yes i love that simon fischer is but a rainbow i think the chief idea behind it was okay you make your enemy uninhibited and extremely aroused and then they are more likely in a non-combat situation to start doing it with each other it wouldn't work in a fight no one's gonna go oh i'm just too horny to fight and they just start running at their own men in the other direction but maybe it's a permanent change you've got your wife back home and your kids what if you come home gay sorry honey i gotta be my true self now this might really backfire because it might make the opposing army like even more bonded with one another because now they're just like i gotta save my dude because like he's great i love him i'm just thinking now there's like super elite gay army it's just you and me skin on skin stripped to the waist that are just so loyal to one another that they are unstoppable just like rolling in rainbow camouflage everybody's just like super afraid [Music] what about guns have you ever fired a gun yeah only a rifle yeah i thought it was pretty neat when i was in america i made a b-line for the gun range yeah went full hog i wanted to see what it was like and uh yeah it turns out it really made me feel like a man people do say that though you know a bit dismissively but there must be something absolutely instinctual about holding a weapon you'd sort of notice that when you if you ever go for a hike and you pick up a stick that just feels really well weighted to hold and you could use it like a weapon i do find myself like naturally carrying that around and just sort of feeling good about it yeah it's the ultimate tool yeah i think there's something about that in the past the ones that pick up a pretty good stick and just walk around with it survive a lot more absolutely they're so loud though oh god i can't stand how loud they are oh silences are banned in most states i think and it seems to me like the reason that that legislation has come into place is because everybody watches the movies and thinks that a gun with a silencer on it sounds like yeah yeah like it's a hitman but it's actually just there so you don't go [ __ ] death yeah it's still really loud i suppose you wouldn't be able to recognize that sound so regularly no can you silence a shotgun oh you can actually uh adds a degree of style to it that's the silencer is a bit like uh adding a mustache into a gun yeah yeah it does make it look a lot cooler you got to admit that much like that lame oh hey that's like immediately cool like i even think he's becomes more handsome between shots you know play it again i'm going to close my eyes and just this is a welcome to america's favorite game show all right well i was definitely silenced oh it sounded like no but i couldn't really tell okay how about this one that is definitely not silence that is full hog interesting silenced okay all four of those were silenced ah you tricked me i did you correctly guessed that it was behind a pillow that's a bloody good one isn't it because that wouldn't silence anything i mean it might make it quieter for the person who's getting shot [Laughter] why the hell else would that work i'm just gonna put the pillow on so it doesn't hurt your ears thank you pillow silencer 120.7 i like the idea that off-screen is just like someone tied to a chair yeah so now we'll use the pillow all right jerry jerry he's got tied up yeah what's the deal with airplane peanuts oh yeah but it only went up to 102 decibels 120.7 cnn this is the ar-15 right a lot of people will buy this just because it's cool why else would you buy a gun is it illegal to look cool now is that what they're saying i'm sorry i really dislike the sort of moralistic tone there i've just like some people just buy this gun to be cool yeah of course isn't there the reason for half the things we do you buy a slightly nicer car or you cut your hair a certain way did you just get that haircut to look like yeah man [ __ ] off the defining characteristic of the ar-15 is the speed and power of the bullet the whole defining feature of a bullet is that they go fast and are powerful yeah well it's no good if it bounces right off here i do like who fired this ball what the hell happened here it looks like a classic like golden eye n64 bullet hole as well it's it's classic you fire too many and these ones start disappearing all right ordinary things let's do gun lessons from people who also don't know much about guns but i know a little bit do you know what the difference is between automatic semi-automatic pump action pump action is the one that where you've gotta sort of like jerk the gun off before it'll fire again more like one trigger pull one bullet and automatic is like hold it down and it goes all over the place if i wanted to fire this on full semi-automatic all i do is keep firing now i won't probably what does that mean quick translate then how do they both look like tim cook he looks like tim cook and mike pence had a baby that's sweet i don't like the way i can see the outline of his nipples through his shirt i kind of feel like for the news just where like i don't do you find it erotic can you not focus yeah i find distracting is that one seems much lower than the other yeah what's up with that it's a weapon designed to inflict maximum damage it's a weapon it's a gun and not enough people are using nord so much of their private data is out in the unit i have to show everyone why the world matters to your plan pirating movies i call the police store his with history that guy is gay he's not buying that for his dog are you sure it's covered wrong building chinese spy [Music] yes i'm just tired of being did you find some cream for that rash sarah [Music] looks like i'm too late to save you hundreds of dollars with region specific pricing on funerals why i couldn't let you expose my secret that i actually enjoy playing field of tanks mobile goodbye nobody would have known will nord survive will the sponsorship contract be renewed find out next time on also get a huge deal up to two-year plan plus four free extra months yay nord.com incognito add when i was a kid there was this brand of sour candy called toxic waste do you get that in australia oh yes yeah yeah it came in the little tub i love that stuff oh man i've been addicted to sour candy since i can remember and of course you know the more that you're told that you're not allowed something the more alluring it becomes i was about five or six i'd sneak some change from the kitchen counter i would take a bit of a side route on the way home and go to the old dairy and sometimes they would have this sour candy and it was uh five cents a piece and i'll go and then i'll buy like a dollars worth i'll scoff it all down on the way home one day i got like five bucks worth of coins that gave you like 50 pieces and 50 pieces is way too many to finish by the time you get home so i had like half a bag full um i'm gonna have to hide this somehow i'll just hide it under my shirt and i walked into the house thinking no one's gonna be the wiser and my sister the first thing she saw she's like what's under your shirt am i on nothing and i go running to my room and maybe with my mom or my dad i don't know they come running after like what was that what do you got what do you got i then like ran out and then i just ran to the neighbors it was like being caught with drugs and i knew this neighbor kid and i was like you gotta take this you're gonna take this and he takes it and he hides it into the cushion and the couch in the lounge and then i walk out the door of the neighbor's place nothing it wasn't anything still sweating from the sound candy as well when i was a kid my contraband was a violent horror movies and such oh no and i remember one time my dad drove me to a sleepover and i wanted to bring some horror movies that i had squirreled away in my room this is great your mom's cleaning your room and she like looks under your bed instead of like porno mex it's just nightmare on illness yeah in fact that did eventually happen i've got given a stun all right the ordinary things let me tell you all about the birds and bees oh jeep oh shucks i don't know nothing about all that business then you take her boyfriend's face and you put it on your face and that's when you run into the room possibly inspired by watching midnight express um i was like got the dvds and like taped them to my torso under my t-shirt and i was just sat next to my dad on the drive there so did he get caught no i didn't but isn't there a big square outline no [ __ ] i think i put like a jumper on as well if i recall actually i remember my dad saying like aren't you warm in that i think it was summer already sweating what if he catches me with kill bill volume two under my shirt so did you watch the movie at the place i don't think people were too impressed right do you want to watch this some guy gets his head cut off i know man i just want to talk about girls we're just trying to have a good time i was hoping i could ruin all your nights people get a fake foot they lose it in a bar brawl of some kind yeah exactly so they give you a fake foot so what would you do if you could have like any sort of fake foot become a weapon what would the weapon be well how about it looks like a normal fur but then i take it off and it's just like one big titanium spike yeah you could like twist it off and replace it with other things like a snooker cue or um you know one of those like grabbers okay so this isn't really a weapon this is a multi-tool yeah i think so like a swiss army foot yeah a multi-tool multi-foot that would be quite good you're caught in the wilderness or whatever and then you've just got a whole bunch of tools in there yeah well no problem let me start a fight i would probably have um it would be a gun for sure this is when you're in the woods is it well see well i'm next to you right now i've got my multi-tool and i've just like twisted my axe attachment on and i'm just like kicking wood i'm kicking trees down yeah i'll shoot you and then i'll take your multi-tool you won't have the twisty bear yeah you've got it like a key exactly little click out of one but one of them is like a wheel powered by an engine that if i just balance on that one wheel i can like go around like rosie and the jetsons oh [ __ ] that would be good like those wheelie shoes but it's diesel [Music] as a you know someone who's completely normal and well adjusted i have thought about if you were to kill someone like what would be the best way to get away with it yeah you know people could have these elaborate plans of killing and all like burn the body in the bath man and the best way is just to find them on the street let off two rounds and just walk away hood up yeah go fast no muscles i think you're right right let's play in a murder brilliant because i don't understand how it's done in the modern day and someone gets away with it yeah let's say i'm trying to kill you right cool yeah so first i have to find your address i'd have to go to england so now there's records of me searching your address there's records of me being in the country i then have to get to your place i rent a car or i take an uber and then all along that route are cameras that are tracking the license plate of the car i'm in and i've got a phone on me and that's being constantly picked up on every cell tower yeah the first thing you want to do is leave your phone at home if you're ubering to your murder i think like let's say i have uber within five kilometers of your place okay and then i just start walking to your place the whole route is gonna have cameras along it and i get to your place and what do i do i like knock on the door and then you answer it and then i have to go like bang everybody sees look at this dude no okay no that means i need to break into your place what do you do from there this is becoming so difficult i say you gotta smash the window in and make it look like a robbery gone wrong bang uh on the way out i steal the dvd's real quick and just put them in my shirt then i guess you just sort of take off running it'll still be a robbery gone wrong and so they'll still start tracking these cameras yeah they'll just start following the line we got him i think you're putting too much faith in the cctv system i think it is quite fallible they're not everywhere right anyway point is it's impossible ordinary things it cannot be done i just think you know if aliens are real that just completely changes the way everyone sees the world it'd be amazing maybe what do you reckon the alien weapon would be well the anal probe is the classic when combined with the gay bomb it stops being a weapon not a weapon it's a medical analytical tool that's a good point do you reckon they clean the probe between analyzing humans depends what the aliens are doing with the probing like are they just measuring butthole circumference for their files what could be done there that wouldn't just be easily done with some sort of alien pill or an x-ray i reckon they pull out that probe go this is [ __ ] disgusting and then they just shoot everyone up the airlock they got another one they're all gross this is gross every time i think i don't know what the [ __ ] i'm saying is horrible you would think it would be just as much mouth probing as there would be hopefully not with the same probe if you were going into a medieval battle what's your choice you know they're all on a wall which do you pick which way western man i feel the scythe is pretty useless in battle a mace though i think a mace is good stuff right like it can bludgeon it's sharp it's easy to use i don't particularly want any of these to be honest that's picky i wouldn't go with the scythe actually not here for the battle the battlefield is just in need of a bit of a train so if i could have any weapon it would just be like this sword and shield i mean it's a classic for a reason let's say you and me one-on-one right all right so i've got the spear you've got the shield and sword who do you reckon wins uh i reckon me reckon i'd abide my time and get you to stick the spear into the shield and then i'm just cutting your spear in half and you're done i don't think you're blocking anything with that shield oh you reckon yeah i think i'm poking at you poking at you and you're moving your shield around and then i managed to get just a little bit behind your shield at one point and then i just press in you can't get my fingers though that's pretty that's not fair let's see like spear versus sort of that's a sword brilliant we can put some money on it all right oh oh i see yeah he's he's sticking him he's gonna try and stick him good i thought mud crabs more fearsome than you i like the spin technique like so you don't know when it's coming yeah yeah exactly well yeah the the charge is the thing as soon as the spear guy has it was at this moment that he knew he [ __ ] up got you to stop within spear distance yes it's game over spear wins the key is not to be spooked by the spear yeah don't fear the spear charge in like a [ __ ] i was half dressed like a bank robber and half dressed like a beekeeper now that you've pointed that out yeah give me all your bees where's the queen let's fear the sting of be man just back on mace's what do you think of this morning star oh yeah that would [ __ ] out pretty good you know what the problem is with this weapon it's got so many points and they're like if you hit someone right in the head with it in the heat of battle it is liable to get stuck and then you're in the situation where you're like trying to pull it out of someone's head and then someone put something in your head there'd be a bomber to clean too like this thing would not go in the dishwasher very well at all what's the like really weak version of this like you could have this ball but instead of spikes you've got those like finger nail cheetos that'd be pretty good i'm trying to think of like a nerf version of the morning star i like the idea of this if it was much much smaller and the head was half the size of a golf ball and had these tiny little prongs it would be exceptional for serving olives yeah that's true i like that you could take one of these and then you just put like a dog too on it and then you just chase people around the battlefield because no one wants to get the dog [ __ ] on them you know that's true you'll be feared on the battlefield it's like when you go to prison obviously i'm not strong i don't have the option of like going up to the biggest guy in there and punching them that wouldn't go well no your only other option is to just act like the craziest [ __ ] possible i have [ __ ] on a stick utterly unpredictable terrifying human being if you spill you know why is this funny to me if you spill your apple juice right over the front of your shirt can you just pop back to your cell and throw on another shirt surely or you're like oh that's my only one and then you have to walk around it's the kind of apple juice down the front of your shirt they must have a wardrobe they must have a place where they put their pants and socks and toothbrush shivs and all sorts that's a weapon the toothbrush shiv prison shivs is that like a little darringer pistol sergeant hal birchfield oh everyone hit those mustaches back and when are they coming back i can't really grow a mustache very well so i'd be a bit upset if that happened really i have a mustache but it's a bit of a howard hughes sort of like pencil mustache hold on a minute let me have a look at this oh yeah i mean i've got what i like to call the anti-hitler i can't grow it in the middle i don't know if this is racist okay continue have you ever noticed how people from eastern europe tend to have that sort of facial hair the same sort of facial ear that you do to be honest i can't say i have noticed that but i'm i'm willing to go ahead with it serbian man all these men have mick mustaches so i'm not sure your theory yeah no it's all falling apart real quick i'm amazed that you've typed in slavic man and none of them are squatting you know what this theory sucks these people will have regular moustaches i don't know why you proposed it to be honest it's kind of racial and it's not true while we're on racist things i've got one more go on yeah please continue have you ever noticed that asian people when they park their car always park their car backwards into the car space that i cannot say that i've spent enough time observing other people parking lot experience right i live near a pretty asian suburb right i love it i love going down there shopping there all the time where you normally see people parking they just you know drive forward straight in but for some reason every time the local residents here park they reverse in and i'm thinking like is it something they are culturally taught that has some sort of advantage okay in an emergency you can drive out faster is that what it's about is it like oh i want to show off my car here look at the front much nicer that's interesting i'm gonna go out on a limb and say it is representative of a culture that forward plans ordinary things bigot confirm if you're done with your racist tirade ordinary things i'd like to move back on to the the topic of it and i do have an asian just because you have an asian friend does not make you not frank have you ever been to cambodia no i haven't when i was there back in the day well i got in their taxi and the guy was like oh you're new here and i was like yeah yeah obviously and then he said do you want to go to the firing range and i was like yes you can use a machine gun you can use some handguns i was like that's sick and then he went up a level and was just like if you've got 200 american dollars you can even fire a rocket launcher at a cow no way you said yes right i will admit that the option did intrigue me but i was pretty broke back then so and also it would have been a bit gross and maybe i would have felt a bit ashamed of myself don't get me wrong i went i didn't use the rocket launcher but i did hock a grenade which was fun killer confirmed oh you threw a grenade what was that like yeah it was great was it spooky i was scared pivot guy he could tell oh god this nervous englishman is going to drop it into his shoe or something i also saw the pen where they had all the sheep and cows oh no they're little nervous faces i'd be nervous that like the pin wouldn't want to come out that easily and so i'll hold it in one hand and then pull the pin but then i'd also pull the grenade out of my hand at the same time if you were to just play football with a grenade would it ever explode as long as the pin didn't come out i think not because the whole point if i recall the pin is creating a chemical reaction with something like a piece of metal that something's connecting yeah okay i've got a bit of question you pulled out the pin right yeah do you think you would be capable of pulling that out with your teeth no really it wasn't quite like a key of a car but it was like there was a bit more of a mechanism to it yeah interesting because i've seen that with like you know there's tom cruise at the end of that movie that's on the screen right now and he he's got like a mouth full of grenade pins at the end and ahaha i've defeated the big bad and i was always wondering like oh i bet that's not that easy today they are amazing i didn't realize you had the expertise if i'm completely honest i didn't really feel like much of expertise i could only afford one it's funny um the guy who's editing this he's ex-army so he's probably like laughing at us right now because i'm sure he's got all sorts of experience with like grenades and tanks and [ __ ] tanks i'd like to drive a tank that would i mean wherever lets me do that that would be sweet you can't drive one over a cow would you go back to cambodia now yes if only for the breakfast the cambodian breakfast is exceptional really why it's like pork and rice but my god the pork is absolutely delicious my core memory of the three weeks i spent there was just like getting up every morning and being like another breakfast please delicious yum yum i gotta tell you there's no breakfast food that i like but in like asian countries it's like what's for breakfast well like duck and chili on rice with some green beans yeah perfect you're setting yourself up for the morning you should be loading up the biggest meal of the day should be in the morning that's when i start my morning i have sausage eggs bacon the whole nine yards so i just get up and cram my little gullet with food i also wonder whether it's like the cuisine that is in europe and western societies required so much preparation that there were only certain things that you could get done by breakfast time yes i think in other countries it's someone's job to get up really early and cook for like everyone else you know what i'm saying i know what you're trying to say it's then you didn't drive a tank in cambodia because they park them all backwards [Music] excalibur sword in the stone what's the one that's found in our lake with a little that is also excalibur i think one of the stories is that when king arthur dies he just like tosses it in a lake ah no man can pull the sword from this stone these strong men come along and they're pulling at it and smudging up the handle out comes asking oh please i'll go on then sir can i ever go on the swording the jig oh we'll all be laughing at your kid but go on i guess he lubes it up and then he just pulls it out it's easy for him if that's the idea isn't it that means he gets to be king which is an interesting system of governance i reckon we should go back to whoever's the strongest gets to be the leader i like that idea once in a while i do see someone who's kind of weak and pathetic and i think why do you get to be in charge i think it should be whoever's the strongest or who's ever slept with the most women hey now you're thinking but how would you prove that you would slip with the most number of women in order to become the king i just like the idea that a guy would show up and just be like yeah i'm running for president and here is a list of 50 women you can call them up it's a few kids that look like me like a bad list of references hey can i use you as a reference yeah what are you running for presidency instead of having a sex scandal he would be like turns out he wasn't having that many affairs oh no he's loyal to his wife what's going on get him out of there how hard is it to put a sword in the stone that's a really good point that would be much more difficult than pulling it out of the stone so the guy who put it in there that should be the guy who's the king okay what else we got for mystical weapons poseidon has a trident sidon's trident good one yeah so he can command the sea with that can't he he can like make the waves move make the fish [ __ ] each other something like that if your trident controls the ocean what's the point of like the pointy bit like he's not using the trident as well as a weapon right wait what's the point of a trident that's a good part yeah actually what was a trident got to do with a c what is a trident is it used for catching fish i don't know i never thought about this as a three-pronged spear is used for spearfishing no way okay i guess it does make sense if you're like going at a school of fish you want as many prongs as you can get yeah what you'd really want is a five prong spear right because see this is 2d explain why it's five better than yeah okay hold on it goes down like that yeah and wherever you so far now if you've got a spear that goes like this then oh [ __ ] i missed it or the fish was over here and so i missed it so what they're doing is they're making two more prongs nice but that's only 2d what you really want is five because yeah i mean that is superior [Music] i think in contrast to this extremely bloodthirsty and violent episode we should walk through a meadow holding hands all right into the sunset yeah we'll do that for about three seconds until the end it gets bored yeah all right outro right first thing i'm gonna do is fill in that mustache gap no stop it i've got a permanent line on one hand and i'm holding your

it get away all right i'm now running up the stairs and doing a very difficult action for the editor to keep up with don't worry i'll make it easier for you by flinging a shuriken into the back of your head yeah i like the idea that i'm running away right in mid-sentence we've got to end this episode and i'm going to end it by ending you okay i break down your door and i start throwing some shurikens at you ah too late i have picked up a wooden table that's okay because that was just my distraction for my real plan which is to feed you this delicious poisoned apple you cannot resist its juicy goodness i already had breakfast oh what did you eat it was some ducks some chili and some green beans from kembo that sounds absolutely delicious i've really lost the appetite for murder would you instead like to hold hands and have a delicious cambodian breakfast that sounds lovely maybe we could kill a cow as well like you did and it's not cannon yeah i know it wasn't a cow was it a child a small cambodian refugee they had survived a much worse country and finally made it to cambodia the place where they could finally prosper but then they ended up in a hole receiving the bad end of a grenade from ordinary things this is rubbish let's try something else yeah everyone go to your computer right now type in tickets to syria comma what happens if i destroy my passport how do i renounce

2OSrvzNW9FE,Veritasium,Science,Backspin Basketball Flies Off Dam,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OSrvzNW9FE,6 years ago,49M views,Science,"Recently some friends of mine went to the Gordon Dam in Tasmania, which is 126.5 meters (or 415 feet) high. Then they dropped a basketball over the edge. You can see that the basketball gets pushed around a bit by the breeze, but it lands basically right below where it was dropped. Now watch what happens when they drop another basketball, but this time with a bit of backspin... ""Woah,  look at that go!"" ""That's incredible."" ""This is Bret who just threw it."" I litterally just dropped it, with a bit of spin, like I didn't even throw it, and it just took off, like we had no idea that was gonna do that. And this is where I come in: the basketball was subject to the Magnus effect, which affects all rotating balls or cylinders as they fly through the air. And it works like this: as the basketball picks up speed, air on the front side of the ball is going in the same direction as its spin, and therefore it gets dragged along with the ball and deflected back. Air on the other side is moving opposite to the ball spin, so the flow separates from the ball instead of getting deflected. The net result is the ball pushes air one way, so the air applies an equal force on the ball the other way. And this is known as the Magnus effect, named after Heinrich Gustav Magnus who described it in 1852. Of course, Isaac Newton beat him to it by nearly two hundred years, describing the flight of tennis balls at Cambridge College. But, you know, he's got enough stuff named after him.... This effect is very important in sports like tennis, soccer and golf, but could it have non-sport applications? Perhaps. This is a sailboat. I know it doesn't look like a sailboat, but those aren't chimneys. They are spinning cylinders called ""Flettner rotors"", and they take the place of the sails. They deflect crosswinds, using the Magnus effect, to propel the ship forwards. And this is a plane with spinning cylinders instead of wings. Using the Magnus effect, the cylinders actually generate more lift than traditional wings. However they also generate way more drag, making them impractical. This place only flew once, and then it crashed. But the Magnus effect is making a comeback. Here is an experimental rotor wing aircraft which generates all its lift from spinning cylinders. And this is the E-Ship 1 which uses four spinning cylinders (that's four Flettner rotors) to increase its efficiency and reduce the amount of diesel it burns. So, in the future, the Magnus effect may help more than just basketballs fly. ""Woah, look at that go!"" Now the real reason my friends from ""How Ridiculous"" were at the dam was to set the world record for the highest basket ever scored.

qJVhGXSZO9Y,The Daily Show with Trevor Noah,News,Donald and Melania Trump: A Love Story for the Ages | The Daily Social Distancing Show,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJVhGXSZO9Y,,7.8M views,News,[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] last week was president trump's first international trip instead of his visits and uh looking at the effects on u.s israel relations everyone was focused on donald melania relations the thing that got an enormous amount of media attention had to do with melania trump the first lady and some video was this an actual slap or did she just pull her hand away she pulled her hand away but i didn't quite see the contact of a slap wow leave it to fox news not to recognize what rejection from a woman looks like she she she slapped his hand away which probably means she wants a promotion first right now on the next leg of trump's trip which took him to the vatican trump's hands really couldn't catch a break because this time the first lady gave him the old down low too slow which made me wonder like when you watch that do you think maybe melania is jealous maybe that's what this was about oh now you want to hold hands donald you sure you wouldn't rather be holding that orb i remember when you used to touch me like the orb donald i told you melania me and the orb was a one-time thing the orb means roughing to me means nothing i was barely hard [Applause] [Music] normally when trump has a bad day we know trump watches fox and friends and yells at the tv but today he did the same thing but we all got to listen in and you could tell from the start that this was going to be special thank you so much for being with us mr president well good morning and i picked a very very special day because it's melania's birthday so i said let's do it on melania's birthday so happy birthday to melania all right hopefully there'll be visits in between but have you decided on or do you want to tell us what you got her well i better not get into that because i may get in trouble maybe i didn't get her so much i'll tell you what she has done i got her a beautiful card how did trump mess up the world's easiest question it's like they threw him a softball and he swung and hid himself in the dick and i mean it's her birthday i can't believe that donald didn't get melania anything for her birthday now she might think he's not a very good husband also i would pay anything to know what he wrote inside that card that he definitely didn't actually get like roses are red love is a mystery i had a historic electoral college victory why did trump say he called into fox and friends because it was melania's birthday like what does that mean he's like honey i've got a great celebration planned for us today i'm gonna talk to some tv people while sitting on the toilet like oh thank you donald my life is a beautiful dream [Applause] [Music] i know a lot of people think we here at the daily show are nothing but haters when it comes to the white house but that's not true i've always been a fan of melania trump you know as a fellow immigrant she inspires me because i know that i can never become president of the united states but if i work hard i might become first lady so she's my role model which is why today melania trump is in my thoughts first lady melania trump is hospitalized tonight after undergoing a surgical procedure on her kidney the white house saying the procedure was for a benign condition and that there were no complications president trump tonight visiting his wife who's expected to remain at the military hospital for the rest of the week they're saying that they want to go ahead and keep her for a week which is unusual in the case like this but it could be because she's the first lady and they just want to pay extra attention yeah she's staying an extra week i feel like after a couple of hours the doctor told her she could go home and melania was like no i should stay i should stay until you check everything out i stay longer i was like okay well miss first lady since we're keeping you longer your husband is on his way to visit okay pull the plug we've tried everything pull the plug it's like you're not on life support i don't care just try it see what happens what's wild about the story is look at these two people how is she the one with the health issue how i mean trump's blood type is kfc positive he does not live a healthy life at a rally last week trump vowed to fight for the rights of the lgbq community you know the weirdest part about this whole melania thing is she went into the hospital it was supposed to be like a two-day thing then she was there for a week then it was two weeks then we didn't see her and then now it's three weeks and then they announced that maybe we'll see her at the end of june i don't know what that means what was even stranger was that trump was he was walking out of the the white house and then he was being interviewed by the press gaggle and then someone said like where's melania and he was like oh she's spying she's looking at us right now and he points it at a window and then all the press turned and there was no one there and then he just walked away and i was just like is is this like a real thing is this like he almost said it like he's being haunted by melania like he sees a ghost that no one else sees but he's like so dumb that he doesn't know he's being haunted because i feel like trump would be that kind of guy he's so like self-absorbed that he wouldn't even know that he's being haunted like the ghost would be there and be like [Music] there'll be like little kids riding bicycles in the white house and he'd be like baron your friends are here do you guys know about my electoral college victory like the lady from the ring would come out of the tv and then trump would grope her and she'd go back in [Applause] like she'd like testify in front of [Applause] congress melania is leaving donald trump behind in washington to go visit africa first lady melania trump leaves on a week-long four nation tour of africa today it will be her first extended international journey without the president she'll visit ghana malawi kenya and egypt i'm so proud of the work this administration is doing through usaid and others and look forward to the opportunity to take the message of my be best campaign to many of the countries and children throughout africa oh man this is so sweet of melania she's going to africa to fight cyber bullying the only issue is that most people in africa are still waiting to get cyber so i mean and and by the way by the way if you're paying attention you'll realize this is yet another instance of the first lady publicly undermining her husband's message right he said lebron is dumb she praised lebron and offered to visit his school he called african country shitholes she chose africa for her first solo trip yeah he roots for the yankees she roots for heart disease you see what's happening here anyway good luck on your trip melania uh i just hope the clothes the kids are wearing aren't too awkward for you [Applause] there's a wardrobe malfunction that's blowing up the news breaking news melania trump making a surprise visit to children at the border but did she hurt the message she was trying to send with an unfortunate wardrobe choice the first lady wearing a jacket bearing the words i really don't care do you wow i really don't care do you wow it looks like when melania was in the hospital she had her last removed although although it is kind of sweet that she made a jacket out of her and donald's wedding vows that's really cool i like that now look we we could spend forever talking about how out of touch this makes melania seem but i don't really care do you you know melania trump with her outfits when she goes to visit people i like i don't know which way it is because i mean like everyone has different theories some people think you know because she said i'm going to the border to see what the real story is with the with the migrant children uh you know the the immigrants that have come in and they're locked up and i was like oh that's really sweet she's going to go and like you know shed her lights on it and then she throws on a jacket that says i don't really care do you and then part of me was going like oh maybe she didn't pay attention she just you know it's tone deaf she didn't think about it and then her spokesperson was like hey no there's no hidden message it was like we just didn't think of it sorry about that and then trump came out and tweeted and he's like that jacket was about the fake news melania's showing that she doesn't care and it's like she just said there's no hidden message and he's like hidden message he's like what are you like i'm not gonna lie when i see things like this it genuinely makes me believe that donald trump didn't collude with russia because i think he would have told us by now i i'm gonna put it out there i i do believe i do believe we're gonna find out people around him tried to collude but i think he would have he tells us everything he just came out he told us why he fired james comey he tells every single secret i don't think he'd be able to keep it in he'd like at some point he would have been like and that's why i concluded they came to me i said let's do it i said let's do it [Music] [Applause] melania trump you know those movies where uh the beautiful but mysterious woman with a foreign accent is actually a secret assassin well maybe we should have seen this coming a dramatic move by melania trump that apparently blindsided top white house aides melania trump's office releasing a statement publicly blasting a national security official the first lady called for deputy national security adviser mira riccardell to be fired complaining directly to her husband about being unhappy with her cardel during her first solo trip to africa in october the two fought over seating on the plane and using national security council resources for the trip the first lady's office issued a statement saying she no longer deserves the honor of serving in this white house sweet lord melania does not mess around we barely hear from her and then when she does speak it's to fire somebody and like whatever this lady did must have made melania so mad because you realize trump cheats on her and she's pretty chill about it but then melania goes on a flight and all of a sudden she's all like [ __ ] took aisle seats [Applause] and like honestly i don't even know who this is mira ricardelle who is this person that they're firing like they're running out of people we know to fire this is like walking dead season six oh no they killed derek [Applause] [Music] there's actually some fake news that is plaguing the president right now it's about melania the fake melania conspiracy is back after the first lady's visit to alabama and georgia this week the theory that melania trump had a body double for public appearances began in 2017 that was denied by fact checkers now though again twitter users are comparing this to other images arguing it's not the same woman but many also commenting lighting and makeup are likely causes for the mistaken identity how is this on the news how is this even a thing of course melania looks a little different on some days right she's a person every person looks different day to day this was me like two months ago okay this was me three years ago all right this was me yesterday when i found out jlo is engaged okay i look different i look different because clearly i'm so happy for her and like the 20th best yankee i'm very happy i'll be fine i'll be fine i just i wanted a-rod for myself so please guys let's stop with this whole fake melania business all right because it's not true although i will say this if you do zoom in on that picture there is something a little suspicious and that is that they're holding hands so on second thought maybe fake melania [Music] [Applause] while her husband has struggled to get his approval rating over 40 percent melania has consistently remained the country's most popular trump and personally i love her too because we have so much in common we're both immigrants neither of us would be here if it weren't for donald trump and i'm just going to put it out there we're both style icons yeah yeah yeah that's right melania this bish stole your look now now the reason i've been thinking about melania lately is because in the wake of trump's recent immigration crackdown i've started to notice something that's got me really concerned i think donald trump is trying to deport melania no and you might be asking why would he want to deport his wife i don't know i don't know but things haven't exactly been perfect between them first of all it's no secret that melania barely spends any time at the white house secondly when he try to hold her hand in public she try to slap it away like a slovenian dikembe mutombo you remember that and who knows it may have even created some tension between them when trump allegedly banged the porn star and paid her to be quiet and then the whole country found out about it any you know normal relationship issues and i know it sounds crazy donald trump wants to deport his wife but but if you look at all of trump's immigration policies right a lot of people think that he just hates immigrants but when you put them all together you start to notice a patent all of his policies seem to be aimed at his wife for example one of the immigration issues trump complains about most is people who come to the united states the wrong way and work in the country illegally and everyone always assumes that because he's racist he's talking about mexicans but i don't think it's a coincidence that that same complaint could apply to his very own wife new questions about melania trump's immigration status when she first came to the u.s the associated press reporting she didn't have the proper visa for her modeling work i came here on visa i flew to slovenia every few months to stamp it and came back trump insists she got her visa stamped every few months if that's accurate it would mean she had a type of visa possibly a tourist visa that needs to be updated periodically but that type of visa does not allow working in the united states when this controversy first bubbled up the trump campaign promised that melania would have a press conference to clear it all up that press conference never happened that's right melania's staff promised that she would hold a press conference to clear up her questionable immigration history and then it never happened now to be fair it's only been three years since that promise was made okay and you guys don't even know how hard it is to throw together a press conference in three years like you you have to get a podium and and like that's pretty much it but still but still it seems a little convenient that trump would bring up the whole legal work thing when he knows his own wife has a shady visa history and clearly when that failed donald tried to switch things up because then he started complaining about how lots of foreigners are taking advantage of america's immigration system by claiming that they were special when in fact they were not now again people assumed trump was talking about indian computer programmers in silicon valley but if you follow the clues you realize this guy was actually slamming his wife the washington post reports that questions linger about how melania trump scored the so-called einstein visa to enter the united states when she was a model in 2001 she was granted a green card in the elite eb-1 program it's designed for academic researchers or people in other fields such as olympic athletes and oscar-winning actors granted to people who demonstrate sustained national and international acclaim and it's usually in the fields of arts business or in academic research now only 3 376 eb1 green cards were issued that year five went to people from slovenia yeah that's right melania got a green card through the einstein visa program which seems strange although i guess if you spend enough time standing next to donald anyone starts to look like einstein well almost anyone and you know you know guys the more you look at it the more it seems like donald trump is trying to deport his wife because who can forget one of his biggest anti-immigration crusades chain migration the president wants to reform the visa lottery system and end so-called chain migration then you have chain migration chain migration chain migration you come in and you bring your whole damn family a guy comes in and then you have to bring his aunt his uncle his father his grandfather his grandparents a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives yes one of the things donald trump hates most about america's immigration policy is that immigrants families can come live with them in the us now even though donald trump says that i want my family back home watching the show to know that this is not true okay you cannot bring unlimited relatives to america do you guys hear me nan israel in fact the law even says that you guys can't crash on my couch and i'm actually not even in town that weekend that's what the law says uncle mangman now it was really slick for trump to make it seem like this thing was about uncles and aunts and cousins but clearly there was someone that he was actually aiming at all along president trump's in-laws slipping in and out of a manhattan federal building where they took the oath of u.s citizenship sources tell abc news that first lady melania trump sponsored her slovenian-born parents victor and amalia knobs taking advantage of the same policy president trump has denigrated as chain migration and vowed to end that's right melania trump helped her parents chain migrate to the u.s so that's what donald trump was trying to stop he was trying to try to turn his in-laws into outlaws yeah which is super hardcore and as if this wasn't enough evidence that donald trump is trying to deport his wife then how do you explain the new policy his administration announced this week huh they came out saying that immigrants who receive assistance from the government may not be allowed to stay in the united states well guess who lives in a free house provided by the united states melania trump i see what you're doing donald i see what you're doing and i'm not gonna let it happen in fact we're not gonna let this thing happen daily show fans join me now help me get the word out by tweeting don't deport melania because if this great immigrant is forced to leave this country then the united states can never truly be best [Music] [Applause] i was thinking i think it would be amazing if in some world melania divorces trump because of the porn star and then gets the white house in the divorce no because in my head i was like i was just playing it all out i would be like it would be the most amazing thing ever like i could see the movie in my head now you know like she has the white house he's at a motel six like just walking around without pants the whole day right and then like foreign leaders are coming to visit him so they have to go to the motel to visit him but they don't know like the prime minister like drives to the white house and then when they get there they're like where is the president melania's on the lawn she's like he doesn't live here anymore he doesn't live here no more he knows what he did you can find him at the motel he's like what do you mean the motel then they like drive to the motel and it's like one of those like florida project motels this is chaos people kids playing outside someone's fixing a car you know donald trump's up you know when the prime minister guess i was like are we at the right place he's like yeah he lives in 16b that's where he is 16b donald trump comes out come on in welcome to it this is my new home they're like telling the prime minister we're going to be sharing a room your bed is this one by the way you speak spanish right mr president yeah you do i need you to talk to my neighbor felipe he's always playing music felipe come meet the president of mexico tell him i don't like his loud music please i am a president you cannot ask me to translate for you are you saying you don't speak spanish no i do so then tell him what i said,21:59

award-winning olive oil of the year so I decided to come and share it with you also there's a man behind the camera that traveled with this in his for about nine hours and it stayed in pristine condition it was wrapped in bubble wrap and another bagging and another bag after that very special thing the Madre the Sorrentino this right here is the sludge and the leftover remnants inside of a wine barrel since nineteen  89 from Monte Falco Umbria my man jean-pierre oveja we went over there oh man come in look like we just changed the oil on the Chevy on a Chevy celebrity uh we have a gorgeous piece of rib eye right here this is like the lesser olive oil still looks good you want to sort the meat salt it with some freedom you know make sure this pan is roaring hot sounded good make sure it's nice and flat on the surface so you get all that good good good crust that you want oh we got some beautiful pickled peppers here how come I can't say something without saying beautiful pickle I've been watching a lot of The Sopranos honestly I just finished six seasons within I would say a week and a half I'm not gonna curse anymore by the way you don't want to move the steak you want it to stay facedown real you know you want to get crunchy on that one side semolina bread is the best choice for me I love the taste of a toasted sesame seed against anything ah it's like a brand new see I'm not happy with this I'm not happy with this pan is that I don't give a this is lies this is real we don't have a food stylist on on deck I decided looks good now you drink a glass of wine while you wait for the meat to rest a little bit it's gonna be nice and pink in the middle and gorgeous oh that's juice can you do me a solid yeah is that basil in the garden here take me oh what a day gorgeous out huh I should come out here and just ten seas Cheers she's gonna unbelievable out what a great day what is this he's driving the East River woman's Berg bridge I'm from New York my

gJ5KV3rzuag,PBS Space Time,Science,Should We Colonize Venus Instead of Mars?,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJ5KV3rzuag,6 years ago,4.6M views,Science,"[MUSIC PLAYING] There's a lot of talk about
sending humans to Mars. But no one talks about Venus. Why not? And could Venus actually
be the better option for a human colony? [MUSIC PLAYING] Going to Mars has
been a fixture in our collective
cultural consciousness for a very long time. It's inspired more sci-fi movies
and stories than I can count, a ride at Disney World, and a
Twitter following for the Mars Rover that's almost
two million strong. Meanwhile, Venus
has inspired-- what? Two Ray Bradbury
stories, a plant that eats flies, and a razor? Basically, Venus has the
worst public relations team in the solar system. And that hurts
our sister planet, not just in culture and
media but in space policy. Presidents Bush and Obama
and the Chinese government have all outlined goals for
manned missions to Mars. The Dutch nonprofit
group Mars One even held in
international competition to find volunteers for a one-way
mission to the Martian surface. But Venus? No manned mission love-- at all. Which is odd since
in most respects, Venus is actually an
easier and less costly colonization target
than Mars is. For starters, Venus
is closer to Earth. That's why we sent probes to
Venus long before we sent them to Mars and why we
sent more of them. Depending on the launch
window, the round trip can be 30% to 50% shorter,
which is a major factor for manned missions. Shorter trips means less
weightlessness and radiation, less food and water
to carry, and thus less fuel and lower cost. This would also be
a huge advantage in moving the people and
equipment necessary to actually colonize another world,
because bear in mind, there's no Craigslist in space. If we ever start a colony,
we'll need to bring along almost everything. And it's not just
the shorter trip. The planet itself has some
significant advantages over Mars. It's closer to the sun,
which means about four times more available solar power
then you have on Mars. It also has a thick atmosphere,
unlike that wispy layer on Mars. That means better protection
from space radiation and meteorites for our
enterprising colonizers and their future cities. It also means more
available carbon dioxide from which, in principle,
you might extract oxygen. But the real kicker is gravity. Venus has about 0.9 Earth
g's-- pretty close-- while Mars has less than 0.4. And one thing we do know is
that prolonged low gravity is bad for humans. How bad? In Earth orbit,
astronauts lose bone mass at about 10 times
the rate of someone with advanced osteoporosis. Now no one knows exactly
how bad Martian gravity would be for humans,
but it's definitely not going to be good. On Venus, that's far
less of a concern. And remember, we're talking
about long-term colonization, not just visits. Even if we have the
technological means to add water to a planet's
surface and oxygen to its air, changing the planet's
surface gravity is currently not even within
the realm of discussion. So terraforming seems silly, and
if people couldn't live there more than a few months without
their bones falling apart. A theoretical
Venutian colony thus seems to have a
lot going for it. So why then this
tunnel vision for Mars? Surfacism. OK, I just made that
word up, but hear me out. Ever since the days of
seafaring exploration, we've had an
obsession with landing on the surface of things. If you don't plant
a flag on something, it's almost like having
gotten there doesn't count. So what's all this have
to do with Venus, which actually has a solid surface? Well it does, but
humans can't land on it. See, there's a teensy
problem with temperature. There's so much CO2 on Venus
that the greenhouse effect makes the surface hotter
than hell-- over 450 degrees Celsius, well above the
melting point of lead. But the bigger problem is
the barometric pressure on the surface. It's over 90
Earth's atmospheres. That means that landing
on the Venutian surface would be like diving one
kilometer underwater on Earth-- far beyond the crush depth
of most military submarines. In fact, most probes
that NASA and the Soviets sent to the surface of
Venus imploded in midair. We learned our lesson and
a few reinforced probes did manage to touch down and
send images of the Venetian surface. But even those only
lasted about two hours before-- [SOUND OF AN IMPLOSION]
--you know. The point is-- I think
surfacism is a real bias. And the fact that we can't
live on the Venutian surface could help explain why
Mars gets all the hype. But maybe that's sensible. I mean, if a surface
will kill us, there's no point in
going there, right? Not so fast. See, around 50
kilometers or 30 miles above the Venutian surface,
some interesting things happen. First, the temperature drops to
only about 70 degrees Celsius. That's still super hot, but
firefighting equipment on Earth can withstand proximity to
forest fires with temperatures that reach over 2,000
degrees Celsius. The pressure at
that altitude also dropped to almost exactly
one Earth atmosphere. That means humans would
need heat-resistant clothing and oxygen masks, but not
spacesuits to walk around in that environment. Granted, there's
the minor nuisance of sulfuric acid floating
around in the Venutian air, but that's potentially
manageable. And at that altitude,
the atmosphere is still dense enough
for lots of stuff to floae-- like balloons
filled with helium or maybe filled even with
just regular Earth air. Throw in the favorable
gravity, and it starts to look like the
upper atmosphere of Venus might be the closest
thing in the solar system to an Earth-like environment. So it might make
sense to colonize Venus with cloud cities. I am not making this up. NASA Systems Analysis
and Concepts Directorate has unveiled a conceptual
blueprint for this scheme. They call it the High
Altitude Venus Operational Concept or HAVOC--
interesting branding choice, but still super awesome. We've linked the NASA
videos in the description. You should check them out. Now for the record, this
is all still conceptual. We are very far from
sending this guy to lead our Venutian Cloud City. But NASA is taking
the idea seriously. Right now, most of
the chatter is still about using Venus as
practice for colonies elsewhere-- like Mars. So we haven't overcome
surfacism just yet. But this might change. The gravity issue alone might
make Venus the go-to option for long-term human habitation. Who know? Centuries from now,
if we learn how to sequester enough carbon
out of its atmosphere, we might even be able
to plant a flag or two. So what do you guys think? Is Venus a better
colonization option than Mars? Put your $0.02 in the comments--
or even better, tweet them, #occupyvenus. If we start a
grassroots movement, I'll let you know on the
next episode of ""Space Time"". Last week, we asked
how you measure the size of the universe? Here are some of your questions. awtizme asked, how can
space be expanding faster than light if the speed of light
is the ultimate speed limit? I'm going to answer
you in two parts. First, the speed of
light speed limit is for things moving through
space, not about expansion of space itself. The second, you're right. I shouldn't be
talking about space expanding at a given speed. I should be talking about the
size of the enlarge setting on a photocopier button. If I hit enlarge
once every second, then there will always
be two points on the page that-- if they're far
enough apart to begin with-- will end up more than one extra
light second apart after I hit that photocopier button. lingwingzing commented that
this was a pretty intuitive way to understand inflation. Thanks for the compliment,
but be careful. We're talking about expansion
of space in general. Inflation refers to a
very specific expansion of space that occurred in
just the first few instances after The Big Bang. The Mattman1313 says
that the Hubble Bubble is a possible
alternative to the idea that space is expanding at all. That's not correct. Space is expanding-- period. What the Hubble Bubble offers
is a potential alternative to the currently observed,
accelerated expansion of space. Look it up. And to Brandon Spears,
sure, we could always use help here at ""Space Time"". Like the Hubble Space
Telescope, we've got schmutz on our lens too, so
give it a wipe and help us out. [MUSIC PLAYING]",7:37

margarita in the city this family-owned pizzeria has been around since 1938. today atilio pachetti is making the pizza here along with his son mariota atelia was making me two of the classics in naples pizza margarita and pizza marinara he put black pepper on it which is very controversial out here and we thought new york had rules [Music] wow thank you gracias this is a fork and knife pizza i'm getting a lesson from a master right now [Music] that piece that i just had was delicious all the other pizzerias that you like enzo cocha is a third generation pizza who take serious pride in the tradition and science behind neapolitan pizza we're going to make pizza together in one of the most exciting and historical places in napoli capo de monte one of the two royal palaces in napoli as the story goes in 1889 rafael esposito created a pizza in honor of queen margarita of savoy she loved it so much that from that day on it became known as pizza margarita the red of the tomatoes the green from the basil and the white of the cheese representing the colors of the italian flag wow what do we have here hey this is old this is an old oven this is the pizza oven for queen margarita it doesn't get any more neapolitan than making a pizza margarita in the oven at the queen's former palace but obviously something had to go wrong we forgot the double zero flower [Music] wow that's there you go and then you open it up right in there no okay i'm just having fun [Music] [Music] when all hope was lost a hero approaches on the horizon with a small bag of just what we needed hey hallelujah [Music] a [Music] okay bye there it is thank you very much i'm happy to be here [Music] this is a bite of history right here [Applause] in the days of queen margarita the pizzaiolo was seen in a much different light back then it was a second-rate job at the bottom of the totem pole but today the job of the pitayolo is deeply respected gino sorbillo is the pizzaiolo that represents this shift more than anybody he's responsible for showing people that pizza can still be the food of the people as well as the highly respected cuisine wow wow delicious gino has an empire from his numerous pizzerias to his pizza fritta shop to the personal pizza museum gino built called the house of pizza neapolitan pizza is not only his passion but his identity this is a pizza house look a stefano ferrara oven i've never seen one like that okay [Music] gino wasn't always a pizza maker before pizza he was a member of the carabineri italy's elite militarized police force he used the savings to buy an abandoned building on via the tribunale which would eventually become his pizzeria sorbilo gino took me to the kitchen to make a pizza okay okay okay [Music] [Music] wow [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] one of the best things about pizza in naples is that all the ingredients come from the region of campagna from the tomatoes grown in the rich soil near mount vesuvius to cheese makers in caserta by default everything on your pizza is locally produced [Music] i'm at a water buffalo farm right now in caserta right outside of napoli this farm produces the milk that makes the buffalo mozzarella cheese for some of the best pizzerias in the world we're going to visit mimo one of the greatest cheese makers in the region the name of his place is called il casolare i'm really excited to see the process for the buffalo cheese 2017. i got my new swag we're ready to go ilika solari makes all kinds of cheese but for pizza purposes there are two kinds that are most important fjorda latte a cow's milk cheese and of course buffalo mozzarella aircraft so the guys on this side will grab a big bowl of the mozzarella and the guys on this side would just break it off so they're really helping each other out to form the balls [Music] no i don't want to kind of want to ruin any more mozzarella [Music] it looks really creamy inside there's a nice shiny outside yeah now it's time to eat yes oh my god it's delicious there's a little tanginess to it and the salt and all the mozzarella juice and water that comes out is like fills your mouth that's a really really really special product um it's not just the pizza ingredients that are from campagna it's also the ovens themselves i'm at the kings of neapolitan ovens stefano and simone ferrara at pizza expo in las vegas this year now i'm lucky enough to see them again but this time at their factory in corto just outside of naples well good to see you again this oven looks special over here this is our standard classic oven as you get closer you kind of see the details exactly there's all the gulf of naples around wow the entire gulf of naples this is everything hand-painted wow let's take a look around yeah sure let's go take a ride so here uh we're putting the tiles on the oven this is the this is the last touching to the the oven and the waste [Music] behind every great neapolitan pizza journey there's someone that's obsessed with pizza meet luciano our local producer who honestly loves pizza more than anyone i've ever met if you do anything related to pizza in naples luciano knows you and he also swears by his pizza diet there are three pizzerias where if i plan to eat a pizza there systematically every time i lose exactly 400 grams not 300 not 500 the next morning luciano is taking me to his favorite pizzeria of all time just outside of naples pepe and granny owned by his good friend and master pizzaiolo franco pepe where are we right now we're about 50 kilometers north of naples in near caserta and this is called cayatso which honestly until i met franco pepe i probably never heard of but then a few years ago he chose to make his own pizzeria he rebuilt from ruins this three-story pizzeria and then kept improving both the dough and the toppings one thing that struck me for the very first time i ate this pizza with the incredible lightness and digestibility so is it typical for a pizza yolo as great as franco pepe to have a pizzeria outside of napoli it could be sam if donet this town was no economy was a almost a ghost town so not only did franco open a pizzeria in his hometown but he helped revitalize his home really there is no better pizzeria i'm afraid of franco so i'm very partial to him but i dare anyone to challenge this i can't wait to meet him definitely let's go we need to run because after seven o'clock it will be crazy and you will not believe what crazy means until you see it that's the city hall apparently we were running late but this didn't stop us from picking up the mayor of cayatso what time does he open 12 minutes ago it's down here can you believe it yes i believe it i really want you to see this he bet all his fortune hold his dreams down a road which could barely walk by a donkey barely literally okay he did it anyone and that's his biggest achievement you know something special is coming as you come down this road yes franco was not happy we were late but luciano charmed them uh and we were off on a tour of franco's pizza palace [Music] incredible and this started with just one table for two people here that's the belvedere i don't think i've seen a pizzeria this beautiful ever in my life no this place is insane it even has an inn this is all his own design no architect no architect pizza hotel this is like a dream come true a pizza man dream come true indeed yeah and how important was it growing up in a pizzeria watching his nun and watching his father making bread grande contacted oh wow you could see the oven right through this table this is insane it was finally time to embark on our pizza taste it so luciano what are we working with here we start with the cheeto and with the biandante these are both deep fried pizza base this one is with mortadella buffalo ricotta cream pistachio greens and lemon zest it's so it's so late cheers fishing [Music] for sure there is a grana cheese cream it's a crumble of cayatsu olives the thing is that you should actually this one because it's named scarpetta in this case you cut it you smear in a sense the tomato this is on pizza number four we're not we are not sad even started yet it's a very delicate pizza wow that's the pizza he prepared for the first time for my son viva santa franco pepe exactly wow you want to calzone this is called the casolare because these are only with products from mimo it seems easy to cut a calzone right first it seemed easy oh this is the one with the escarole inside so it's a buffalo ricotta scented with lemon dried olives apricot preserve and a mint leaf cheers [Music] oh my god it is a little sweet yes you know i got so much weeds in here i'm like humpty dumpty i'm about to tip i think we should leave more another glass [Music] franco pepe is a pizza wizard and when you eat food like this you could just taste the thought that went into it if you are a pizza lover as i think i am yeah you understand the thought process behind it and then that the thought process dissolves completely in pure pleasure right and that's exactly i think what he wants to achieve it's almost like he built his castle and everyone came and it just it's perfect it's a fairy tale it's really is the perfect storm for pizza positively everything well said so well said okay cheers okay well oh hold on hold on let me help you out of this there we go okay now we go cheers where the hell luciano golf hello my trip to naples is coming to a close but i have one last stop i'm meeting up with simona ferrara for a goodbye dinner at enzo coach's pizzeria dedicated to the pizza fritta the street food staple i've eaten my weight neapolitan pizza so why not have it deep fried and with a glass of champagne this is street food done well with some champagne this is like it's elevated street food in here i mean hey if it's sitting here i'm gonna go in the pride that the pizza makers have here in napoli it's it's something else unbelievable a lot of them are very proud about their work in the pizza world you hear all these big names you know you hear about franco pepe you hear about gino sabillo but when i met them they were all kind you know and like very generous it's like uh mikasa is to casa 100 i mean every city has its own characteristics napoli is this,26:09
CVClHLwv-4I,Web Dev Simplified,Tech,Build Real Time Face Detection With JavaScript,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVClHLwv-4I,2 years ago,1.1M views,Tech,do you like robots because I sure do so in today's video I'm going to be using artificial intelligence and face recognition to determine my emotions through my webcam in real-time also if you enjoyed this video make sure to let me know down below so that I can create a part two to this video where I use face recognition in order to determine who is in a picture and display their name next to their face let's get started now in order to accomplish this face recognition we're going to be using a library called face APA jeaious you can see over here on the right and this is a wrapper around tensorflow which is one of the most popular machine learning libraries out there and this is going to allow us to do real-time face detection in the browser and it's really easy to get set up with the first thing that you need to do is download this library there's going to be a link in the description below where you can download this library from also you're going to need to download the models that you'll be using for your face detection when we get to the models section I'm going to list off all the models that we use so that you can download them all so all of the models are going to be available on my github in the source code for this video so you can get them there as well to get started we just want to create a blank HTML page here and inside of this we want to put a video element because this is going to be where we render our webcam where we do our real-time face detection and this is just going to have an ID of video so we can easily access it in the JavaScript and we're just going to give it a width here you can use whatever width and height that you want but in our case I'm going to use 720 and I'm going to use a height of 560 and you want to make sure you just set this to the autoplay and mute it because we don't actually want any sound and you have to make sure you specify a width and a height on here otherwise the face detection will not be able to draw properly onto your webcam now once we have that done I'm just going to add a little bit of basic styling to our sheet so we can come in here and add a style tag and really all I'm going to do is just style the body of this so I'm going to give it no margin make that zero same thing with padding here we're gonna do zero and essentially the reason I'm doing this styling is just to get the webcam is centered in the screen so I'm gonna set the width to 100 view widths the height is going to be 100 view Heights and I'm going to change this to be display flex just to find the content in the center and align the items items in the center and this is just going to put the webcam in the very center of the screen so we can just open this up with live server just to see what we have working with and here we go it's loading up and obviously nothing is going to render for our video because we haven't actually hooked up our webcam into our video yet so let's go into our script here and work on doing that first we need to get that video element so we're gonna create an element here called vo and we can say document dot get element by ID and we gave it an ID of video and this is going to be our video tech then we can create a function called start video we're going to use this to hook up our webcam to our video element so in order to get the webcam we need to use navigator getusermedia and this is going to take an object as the first parameter and this just says what we want to get and we want to get the video elements we're just going to say video is the key and an empty object as the parameter then we're going to have a method here which is going to be stream this is essentially what's coming from our webcam so what's coming from our webcam we want to set as the source of our video so we'll say video source object is going to be equal to that stream and then lastly we have an error function that we can call here so if we do get an error we just want to log that so will say console dot log err oops err just like that and let's make sure it's an error log instead of a normal log and now if we call that function we can just say start video and go into our HTML make sure to include that so up here we're going to include our script tag make sure we set it to defer and we want the source of that to be our script J s now if we save that you should see that it's going to access our video it'll load up right here and this is just a live preview of my webcam it may be slightly delayed but that's just because it's going through the browser as opposed to going directly into my recording software so now once we have that done let's also include our face API library while we're at it so we can do a script here we want to defer this one as well and we want the face API and we want to make sure that this is defined above our normal script so that it gets loaded before we actually run our script and now we can work on actually setting up our script in order to detect my face as opposed to just render my video in order to do that we need to load all of the different models so let's do that at the very top and this is all done asynchronously so we want to use promess alt which is going to run all of these asynchronous calls in parallel which will make it much quicker to execute and in here we just pass an array of all of our promises what you do is you want to call face API nets and then this is going to be where you call all the different models you want in our case we're using the tiny face detector this is just like any normal face detector but it's going to be smaller and quicker so it'll run in real time in the browser as opposed to being very slow and we want to say it load from whoops if I spell it properly load from URI and in here we have a models folder with all of our different models so we're going to just pass that in we'll just say slash models we wanted to do this a couple times for all of our different models so let's copy that down four times and we have our tiny face detector the next one that we have is going to be our face landmark whoops landmark 68 net and this is going to be able to register the different parts of Maya faces post my mouth my eyes my nose etc next thing that we're going to have here is face recognition I can spell that recognition net and this is just going to be able to allow the API to recognize where my face is the box around it and then lastly we're going to have is face expression net and lips expression just like that and what this is going to allow it to do is to recognize when I'm smiling frowning happy sad etc so what we want to do now is how much doll is going to take a dot Ben and after we're done with this we want to call our start video so we can remove this here and now once we're done loading all of our models it's going to start the video over here on the side and it may take a little bit longer because loading these models does take a little bit of time but it's fairly quick then we can actually set up an event listener so we can say video add event listener we want to do is we want to add event listener for when the video starts playing so then when the video starts playing we're going to have our code down here which we can say to recognize our face for now let's just do a simple console dot log and we should log whatever come over here and inspect that and as soon as the video start you see we get that log down here at the bottom which means we know that everything's working so far now we can work on actually setting up the face detection and this is actually incredibly straightforward to do what we want to do is we want to do a set interval so that we can run the code inside of this multiple times in a row we want to make sure it's an asynchronous function because this is going to be an asynchronous library and all we need to do inside of here is get our detection so we're going to just say detections is going to be equal to awaiting our face API or the a face api dot detect all faces and this is going to get all the faces inside of the webcam image every single time that this gets called and we're going to do this for example every 100 milliseconds and what we want to do instead of here is we want to pass the element which in our case is a video element as well as what type of library we're going to use to detect the faces in our case we're using the tiny face API so we'll say face API dot tiny face whoops face detector options and this is just going to be empty because we don't want to pass any custom options because the default is going to work perfectly fine for our scenario then we also say what we want to detect these faces with so we're just going to say with face landmarks and this is going to be for when we actually draw the face on the screen we're going to be able to see these different sized sections so the face landmarks is going to be the different dots that you'll see on my face and then we can say dot with face expressions and this is going to be able to determine whether I'm happy sad angry upset whatever based on just the image that it gets of my face so let's make sure I spell that properly there we go now we could just log out these detections so we're going to say oops console dot log detections just so we can see that if this is working and we can go inspect over here and you can see that we're getting an error immediately and is saying tiny face detector options is not a constructor and then super easy to fix this just needs to be a capital T over here we can save this and now we should be able to actually get our detection is showing up over here so let's make sure there we go and you can see we have a bunch of objects in here and we just have one element in the array because there's only one face currently and this is all the different detection information expressions etc and what we want to do is actually display this on the screen and to do that we're going to be using a canvas element so inside of our index.html here we just want to style this canvas it has to be positioned absolute so that it positions directly over top of our video element and we don't actually need to put the canvas element inside of our HTML because we can do that in our JavaScript so let's do that now we can just say canvas is going to be equal to face API create canvas from media oops media and we want to create it from our video element then what we want to do is just add that canvas to the screen so we're going to say document body that append and this is just going to put this at the very end of our page and since it's positioned absolutely it doesn't really matter where it goes and then what we want to do is get the display size of our current video and this will be so that our canvas can be sized perfectly over our video so this is just going to be an object with a width which is just video dot width and it's going to have a height property which is video dot height now that we have that another way we can actually work on displaying our elements inside the canvas so we want to take our detection x' which we have right here create a new variable which is going to be called resized detection x' we just want to set this to our face api dot resize or results and we want to pass in here the detection is that we have as well as the display size and this is just going to make it so that the boxes that show up around my face are properly sized for the video element that we're using over here as well as for our canvas let's make this a little wider so it's easier to see and now all we need to do is actually just draw this we can say face api draw dot draw detection oops detection and what we do is you pass in the canvas we want to draw onto as well as our resize detections and make sure I spell face API correctly over here let's save that and see how this works it's going to load in my face over here and as you can see it's already got a problem because our canvas isn't being cleared and we have our video element being shown up over top which is definitely not what we want the first thing we can do to fix this is to actually clear our canvas before we draw it so let's remove this console dot log and instead of here right after we get our detection is right after we resize everything and right before we draw we want to take our canvas and we want to get the context the 2d context this is just a two-dimensional canvas and we just want to clear it so we'll stay clear rect and we want to clear it from zero zero and the width is going to be the just the canvas start with and the canvas height for the height this is going to clear the entire canvas also we want to make sure we match our canvas to this display size so we can say face API dot match dimensions oops dot match dimensions and we put it in our canvas as well as our display size make sure we spell dimensions properly and now if we save that we should get much better detection over on the side and if we just give it a second you can see that it's detecting my face and as I it's following me around it also has a number which is how percent sure it is so it's about 90 percent sure that this is a face which is perfect so now we can actually start drawing even more details if we can go into the face API draw again and this time we can draw the landmarks so we can say to our face landmarks this is going to take the canvas as well as the resized results and if we save that woops resized results save that again let it refresh over here and now you'll see that it'll actually draw up some lines and dots on my face based on where the landmarks in my face are I notice that's actually not working and that's just because this should be called resized detections not resized results so let's save that refresh it again and let it do its work and if we wait a second you'll see that it now has all the different face detection it knows where my eyes are my eyebrows my actual face shape my mouths nose etc and lastly if we want to determine if I'm happy sad or whatnot based on this image we can go into the face API here again draw and this time we want to draw the face expressions this is going to take a canvas element as well as it's going to take our resized detections again now if we save that it'll be able to determine my emotion based on just my image alone so you can see that it's about a hundred percent sure that I'm neutral but if I make a surprised face for example it says it's 100% charm surprised and if I look angry it'll say I'm angry and so on which is really impressive and that's all it takes to create this simple face detection algorithm if you want more artificial intelligence and face detection let me know down in the comments below and I'll definitely make videos like that also check out some of my other project-based videos linked over here and subscribe to the channel for more videos just like this thank you very much for watching and

MFVXsnq230c,Mark Rober,Science,25 MILLION Orbeez in a pool- Do you sink or float?,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFVXsnq230c,5 years ago,51M views,Science,"A while back I was eating lunch with
some co-workers and we were debating about just how far you would sink if you
jumped into a pool of these orbeez For example would it go up to your calf
or to like your waist or all the way above your head Everyone seemed to have
a different theory, in fact I asked about a hundred people and you can see how
much the guess is varied, so as a firm believer in the scientific method I
decided to test our hypotheses So I'm here today in the backyard of the
backyard scientist. so for the past six months we've been stockpiling these
orbeez in Kevin's backyard and today it's finally the moment of truth all right you ready for this let's do it
so take a moment to guess in the comments below of how far you think we'll
sink and then we'll see if you're right For the record I think I will sink to about
the waist, okay here we go This Feels so crazy   This feels like its compressed on all sides but
it's so smooth and like slippery So it looks like I was wrong by quite a bit
and we have to reject the null hypothesis So now what I decided to call
up my nephews you guys want to come swimming at my friend's house in my
ongoing quest to be the favorite uncle only I might have forgotten to tell them
there'd be no water in the pool also that kevin was right there You guys ready to go swimming in this But before we go swimming in 25 million orbeez let's talk about why I was wrong It has to do with buoyancy so here's a riddle when
this ice melts will the water level go up or down as you can see here it
actually doesn't change at all Archimedes taught us that you displace
your weight in water so this baseball weighs about 135 grams
and when I put it in water it will sink until it is pushed out 135 grams worth
of water at which point it's in equilibrium and it floats and since the
waterline is about halfway up the baseball you know it's about half as
dense as water and this is why scooby-doo quicksand is pure lies you
sink until you've displaced your weight in quicksand and since it's about twice
as dense as a person you Bob like a cork about halfway down and it's impossible
to sink so Atreyu relax your horse is going to float So I
will keep sinking in Orbeez until I have displaced my weight in Orbeez and since
they're a little more dense than me and taking account the packing efficiency of
a sphere surrounded by water the fact that about 85 percent of me sank makes
sense I thought the friction between the balls
would play a bigger role which is why I guessed halfway so I was wrong but a lot
of times that's more fun because that means the result was unexpected and you
learn something okay back to the pool Guess where my foot is So a huge thanks to Kevin for letting us
use his pool he actually also made a video we did eight crazy experiments
with a pool full of water balls so go check that out because his footage is
amazing as always I also want to thank Squarespace for helping to make this

WiUBM8bbDS4,Shroud,VideoGames,WHY I DONT PLAY PUBG MOBILE,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiUBM8bbDS4,3 years ago,5M views,VideoGames,yes I mean it's basically theft and there's so many companies that partner up with streamers specifically just so they can claim reuploaded content on you that's bid which in a way I can understand oh okay but I also find it extremely ironic because usually streamers commentary is just them sitting there they're not adding anything to it that's me right now ie people bother reuploading me as youtubers can argue that their work is transformative understand each other the world that's me a better place that's right that's all I speak I just want people to be happy trust me that's be watching boots it's much like on this video thank you very much for watching make sure to hit spawns I bet a few it's video so become a sponsor so you can see that and that's it for me for now thank you guys so much for watching I'll see you guys - holy [ __ ] you guys remember I have fifty seven thousand subscribers Jesus all right I'm famous I'm peds video I did it I did it we made it we're out hit subscribe god damn me I gotta you do I got you I'm sorry I'm sorry I was subscribed on my 7 other accounts ah hey I'm not here to call shout out sorry anything else but him subscribing third example Exhibit C I'm sorry - sorry I'll never do that again thought I gave her the benefit of the doubt but I'm stuck I'm stuck at people what why would they do this no I actually can't have stuck in three times look at the spawn sorry I'm a very [Music] [ __ ] that guy let's go why would they not have the loading screen the map that you're loading into well cuz they're trying to promote the kinde well for me it was like it was the Wrangell what that was was my luck that was my loading screen I'm pretty sure I've never seen anything but the candy since we can do oh no I see all sorts of ones but I feel like it just load the map that you're playing oh don't even have a standard one all think they do with the jet ski right ernõ that's me remark I don't know I can't remember the sand on one because they have the Wrangell one which is in poaching paranoia check in Roz Roz [ __ ] and then they have the jet ski in Miramar by prison and then a candy I don't really know the matte well I don't know what they're overlooking on that mountain I have to have it or even notice a knock one is I'm gonna use this gun but thank you told me to reload it that's crazy how long you can do five minutes in there I was referring to how he talks to the gaming community as reference to comparing you guys players etc I would never consider a streamer to be an sports player and athlete someone that praising plays a game professionally okay sure you know you got practice regimens you work as a team you know a streamer will know a streamer is not a sports player an athlete a streamer is just an entertainer simple as that you know we can work whatever the [ __ ] we want we're not limited and we're not we're not stuck to you know practicing with the team for like from like 11 to 8 you know we're not competing I mean sometimes we compete but you know I mean it's different line it's different I like this that's pretty good Pro gaming's not sports I mean it is the same idea it's just not it's not a physical I mean you know it's just like his cello playing professionally in a video game is definitely a serious sport this is pop G min let's just sign up for sign a contract guys just always in our game you stop sniping you [ __ ] suck at this game I'm sorry dude I only mean that if your streamer sniper if you're not I don't mean that uh was this game pretty good guy sighs to me that huh Chad Wow it's crazy yeah this game is just so broken still broken still broken it is what this guy did have a vest he didn't heal I hit him [ __ ] 2 times of the shocker that's so that's his bro that took so many shots [ __ ] okay right I gotta choke my drink after that one drinking again oh yeah what does I tread the way scare them away resume in the smoke Tyler what where did all these [ __ ] people come from they're all they're all snipers are for the last game remember smoke weed who's there seems far we'll really defend these game cakes games good it's just like dying off I'm saying it just it what like what hurts about this game is like the game is great oh yeah it could have been so much more but they just didn't do anything and they still haven't done anything you know I mean it's like 494 dice capitalizing on the [ __ ] Colonel bit did like this game I owns an Asia still pubsey pub Jibo Bowl is where it's at though how much each bubble owns in pub G like cough G mobile is so much more popular than pub G it's [ __ ] crazy like I get so many messages a day asking me for me like people want me to play pubs you bubbles so bad I get so many fan messages that like please give it a shot so good that's it like I know it's good but like I don't want to play mobile you know I mean that's kind of weird it's really good though it runs great shred that non-mobile attitudes due to cost you millions just like the note for tonight attitudes crossing you oh yeah for sure I've lost millions to not playing mobile and and playing for tonight for sure but how many millions does millions so what may I need you know you know saying I think I'm gonna be okay I'm making an excellent living feel like you need to be happy with what you're doing sue you know like I've never been about it for the money ever in my life about [ __ ] pro gaming and streaming I mean it helps that there's a lot of money there but that doesn't mean I'm gonna [ __ ] sacrifice some happiness just to make some more millions or whatever oh my god Chad you are just the furthest away they're not even like rendering down there little guy you see me wave if I wave are you waving yeah I see you're a little [ __ ] ahead bro you have a scope Chad yeah scope me for that oh oh it's a bike it's my rents go see you discover me okay watches what kind of [ __ ] did you decide on so I decided I said [ __ ] it and I was like you know what man I'm going all the way with the [ __ ] so I bought some really nice toilets one for my master bath for one for the downstairs board that this is just it's this this map takes three years please tell me you bidet it up yes yes I will have a good day on all my toilets I'm really curious how that's gonna go I've never had one before I've never used it but I really want to spray water at my ass I really really impressive I hate toilet paper so much I can't wait thank you as I was moving up the mountain [Music] good yeah down one he was close to hell I don't know where his boys are it must've been the guys it was the guy's great he was so low I only hit him in the chest damn Muskaan it does look really good it's aesthetically pleasing for sure it just sucks that's what they were going for you know that's like that's what they've cut down to they can't like they don't know what to do like I mean maybe they do but I just don't want to do it I just do this instead the cell they try to sell people like look at this pretty bad for me nobody give a [ __ ] about graphics casuals are [ __ ] they don't they don't sell game you know they definitely actually do anyway jump out so I could get [Music] this great house on the edge here right next to me watch him watch him oh no mad dude my gun to the right click we're good nowhere we just gave her a new vid Oh vanity I'm just actually saved now far right clothes for avocados got this big rock right right here this clothes on what sturdy day okay okay next to it and in the house to the right of that another one same dough Oh oh my god I'm so better jump he's almost done an Easter how yeah I got you go in reverse that's our nade yeah Tyler you should get out to minimal damage really Becca Chad and you put the Nate under try not to blow it up you know yeah I know what you're saying I mean if you put us if you put it under the car from the beginning you could hurt but now it's now no now you had to put it under the car stop I feel like if it was right under it would have blown up it doesn't make sense why it's stuck Tyler but you just kind of accept it move on that's a [ __ ] pity we could make it work okay top that up that up there all that work dude all that [ __ ] work Brenda greed all that loot and all that work for that man come on come on Tyler hit me I committed the come on I just had to prove I had to prove that your driving is lackluster I think you'd guess where is the skills man the drift Plato's David [ __ ] years Toki and I only did it so the video so you proceed what is that you're owning hey you drive a little more even in front of drink back oh [ __ ] it al do do we or not I mean well never know like it what please please just say yeah we're just gonna die in a couple seconds here I'll just do a little bit more recoil control and that Raza [Music] a bunch of psychos these guys know they were here and with his fists out who's yelling Scotty oh okay see we're live I wanna 15 eggs sure look I think we're gonna be okay we're a good spot somewhere I'm sure guys know on the floor on the floor come here this team is still alive there's still one here somebody care keratin what there's still one of this team I did I couldn't see him I was like North okay wait wait maybe there's the guys I don't wanna be there's that three actually there's smoke let's do okay fifteen I don't know where the other one went bring the SLR I saw this band I know I did I'm sure you know rocks okay wow I guess I didn't see anyone I don't sorry Jack waste my time I love that we do it you were with me I love it ah [ __ ] I

_RKYQdUUttc,Austin Evans,Tech,Trying The Cheapest Keyboards on Amazon...,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RKYQdUUttc,3 years ago,6.1M views,Tech,"- Hey guys, this is Austin and these are the cheapest
keyboards on Amazon. But the question is, are they actually any good? So we take a look at a
lot of expensive things on the channel, but what
I was really curious about is whether it actually makes sense to go extremely cheap. What better way to start than with well, a bunch of keyboards of varying degrees of quality but all of which are
actually really affordable. To start out with, we have the Verbatim
Slimline Corded keyboard. When we purchased this, it was only $5.21 on Amazon but now it's available with a mouse for $10.21. So you know, quality. Not only do we have adjustable tilt legs, a stylish and slim design as well as advanced tactile keys. Something I look for in all
of my five dollar keyboards but importantly, it supports Windows XP,
2000, Vista, 7 and 8. So if you need a sweet
Windows XP keyboard, they've got you covered. There are tons of
dedicated gaming keyboards, things like mechanical stuff, but I think really the question I want to answer with this video is, do you really need to spend 30, 40, 50, 60, or even a hundred dollars plus on a keyboard? Of course you don't have to but what's the real difference you're getting really something like this, which is only going to cost
you about five dollars. Well, you get better
packaging on the other ones. That's for sure. I'll give them this. This is about as slim
as a keyboard gets. It's definitely one of
the most lightweight keyboards I've ever used. (laughs) Shout out to the not a Windows key that's on the bottom here. It's not Windows, it's the square key. You know, the square key. At first glance, the
layout seems to be fine. We have basically all
the keys we would expect, including a slightly
weird looking Enter key and a smaller Backspace. We also interestingly have
power, sleep and wake. Does that actually work? Oh, it works. Wait, can I wake up? Wake up. I don't think anyone's going to think that this is a gaming keyboard, but it doesn't feel too bad, so one of the things I really noticed is that it is a little
bit on the springer side and that's definitely because
this is very much a rubber dome style keyboard, but I don't know, I can live with it. Is it going to last a long time? Probably not. Can you use it for a little while and actually be completely
competent at gaming and a little bit of typing and basic use? Absolutely. Next up we have the Amazon
Basics wired keyboard at a whopping $13.22. Now with something like 3600 reviews. It seems to be one of the
more popular keyboards on Amazon full stop. What they've done here
is it's a little bit more of a slimmer design, so it does have a sort of built in rest as opposed to the other one
which did have the feet. It's also got a lot of
glossy black plastic. Oh boy, all right. So yeah, that glossy black plastic, as you can probably see
with three seconds of usage, it's going to get a little fingerprinty, a little dirty, but I guess
you can look past that when you're spending
13 bucks on a keyboard. The layout thankfully is a lot nicer. We have a full size Backspace key. The Enter key, it's all
as you would expect. We have a few things like Media keys, which is a nice little addition
on such a cheap keyboard. Oh, we can get a little
shortcut to the calculator. I guess that's useful and
most importantly of all, we have an actual Windows key, not a weird square. I'm sure the licensing cost was tremendous on such a cheap keyboard. I can tell this immediately
has a better feel. Now it is definitely
still a membrane keyboard it's not going to be anywhere near as nice as something like a mechanical
keyboard to type on, but it's a lot less
mushy than the Verbatim and I really do appreciate that it does have a standard layout. We even have the media control keys. I will say almost immediately that while I do prefer this for typing, I actually don't quite
like the feel for gaming. It just feels like there's
maybe a little bit more latency or a little bit of input lag. It just feels a little different. And a big part of that
actually could be the fact that the key switches
aren't quite as responsive. That's a little weird. Next up we have a Bluetooth keyboard, or more specifically the
cheapest Bluetooth keyboard with Amazon Prime that we could find. So at $15 this... Well, it's a lot smaller, I'll say that, it's a whole lot smaller. Wait is this actually
a full size keyboard? Okay well that looks exactly
like an Apple keyboard. It's really weird at
how light it is though. We don't have a battery in, do we? No, we need a ... Is that AA you think? Oh wait, they're AAAs, I lied. Yeah, those are...be right back. One of the advantages of going
with the Bluetooth keyboard is it does support multiple devices including Macs as well as iOS devices, which is especially evident when you look at the keyboard layout, which I just realized is the Mac layout with the Command and the
Option and the Control. So, we do have a Windows
key and a Windows mode if we switch over to it. If I can figure out how to do that. Due to a slight oversight in that the PC we're testing
with doesn't have Bluetooth, we're going to use my phone. Oh boy I love being prepared
for videos like this. (clears throat) Anyway, let's give this a try. So thankfully it is full size. One thing I do immediately notice though, is that it's kind of flimsy. If you look, I can barely bend it and there's a lot of flexing. It shouldn't be a big deal unless you're very aggressive typer. Are there aggressive typers? Oh yeah, dude look at that. If you really press down
the whole thing flexes. It should be okay though but... No, I disconnected it. Why does... Okay, so maybe super cheap
Bluetooth keyboards: not the move. I actually will say the
keyboard doesn't feel too bad. Actually know what it feels like? It kind of feels like the original version of this Apple keyboard, which is like what, 80 bucks or something? It's not quite as nice to be fair. It's all made of plastic, but
it doesn't feel bad at all. Look at that, I can change the brightness. What? That's actually kind of cool. For 15 bucks this isn't too bad. Yes, you should plan ahead and make sure your computer
supports Bluetooth, but even if you are syncing
it to something like your iPad or iPhone or something, this really is surprisingly
decent for $15. I'm kind of impressed. Last but not least, we have the Rii RK100+. The cheapest RGB keyboard on Amazon, which we picked up for about $15. However right now it's
actually available for $10 and seventy three cents. So yeah, this is actually
the cheapest keyboard here technically as of this very second. This is another one of
the options that we chose not only just because it was the cheapest, but also it has a fairly
decent amount of reviews. It's got 492 on Amazon right now and that looks like a
much more beefy keyboard even though it's still
incredibly lightweight. Plug this guy in and holy RGB Batman. That is actually kind of a cool look. Now, unlike most RGB keyboards that do have a much more
comprehensive set of software that kind of allow you
to customize the zones with this guy, we can either
turn on or turn it off, which conveniently replaces
our right Windows key, but regardless we have RGB. So let's give this guy a try. All right yeah. This is actually a lot better
than that Amazon keyboard. One of the things that
I immediately noticed is that where that one
felt a little bit sticky. The keys actually pop
up a lot quicker here. Now I'm sure if you open it up it's still going to be
a membrane keyboard, but between that and the RGB, I've got to say this is
actually totally a decent looking keyboard. Now no, the key caps
themselves aren't RGB and it is of course all made of plastic, but I kind of like the look
of sort of illuminating the backside with the RGB as opposed to doing the individual keys. It's not customizable but it
looks legitimately different than pretty much any other
gaming keyboard out there. Something I immediately noticed is that there's a nice
little bit of texture on the keys themselves. It doesn't make a big difference, but it does give you
a little bit more grip with your fingers. It's not something huge or anything that sort of blows me away, but it is a nice little
bit of an addition. Importantly, it feels good for gaming. It is not as good as a
mechanical keyboard for example, but realistically, unless
you're actually really skilled unlike me, it's probably not going to
notice a huge difference. I know I'm not any better with this than a Mechanical keyboard or vice versa. Here we go. Yeah, there we go. Well that was worth it. (laughs) So should you buy the
cheapest keyboard on Amazon? It's actually not a totally crazy idea. Now the Rii is definitely my favorite. I like the RGB for gaming, it has a good feel and
it's got a decent layout and realistically if you're spending less than say $30, $40, this really should be
the keyboard you pick up. I'm very, very impressed.",8:06
REhLHpdLCE0,Eater,Food,How Sea Urchin (Uni) Is Processed Commercially — How to Make It,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REhLHpdLCE0,3 years ago,5.1M views,Food,"(chopping sounds) - This is really therapeutic. (laughs) (upbeat techno music) I've used uni all throughout my career. It's basically umami that's
already created for you. It's also called fish
butter, butter of the sea. Nowadays, you don't see
it just plopped on sushi. The possibilities are endless. I receive it in a very
expensive little wooden tray and we are here to see that
process from the beginning. (energetic techno music) We're about to bring out some sea urchin. How did these get here? - We got one boat coming
from Santa Barbara Island, which is a small island
about 20 miles from shore. We got another one from
San Clemente Island, which is about 60 miles from shore. - So they're sorted in here by boat, and then we're gonna bring 'em out-- - Absolutely, yeah. - Over here to sort. - Yeah. - [Katie] They're diving for these, they're picking them individually by hand. - They're picking 'em
individually by hand, one by one. This boat had to go 90
feet, around 90 feet. - Oh, wow. - Yeah, around 90 to 100 feet. (energetic techno music) Give it a little whack, yup. And try to split it, there you go. - Got it. - [Mark] Yeah, the mouth,
look for the mouth. There you go, you got it. (chopping noises) There you go, there you go. - Ooh, I kinda like it. We're sticking it in
the mouth, or the beak. - [Mark] And crack it, there you go. - [Katie] So there's
five pieces per urchin. - [Mark] There's five tongues, yup. - I thought that there was one per, there's actually five per urchin. After they're cracked open, we're gonna scoop 'em out. - [Mark] Without damaging them. - Got it, that's the biggest part. So this is salt water. - [Mark] Yup. - [Katie] What happens if I
accidentally slice into one? - They drop a grade. So they usually drop, you
know, a couple of dollars. - Maybe we don't want me over here in this part of the process. I'm kind of holding my breath, 'cause I know that one wrong move or if I'm not working delicately enough, that is directly costing him money. We've scooped the urchin and
now we're starting to clean it. - And as you can see already here, there's a bunch of different
colors for the sea urchin. - Let's talk a little bit about that. We're in California, so let's
talk California verse Japan. - Right, it's a different
species in Japan. The size is obviously different,
the feed is different. You know, the Japan sea
urchin is very good as well. - [Katie] Is this good enough to move on? - [Mark] Yup, that's okay. We're picking out the premium. - [Katie] So this is the premium. These blue trays are top grade. - [Mark] Yup. - The sorting for grading is starting to happen right now already. - We sort out the premiums here because we process the premiums
a little bit differently than the other grades. - [Katie] So grading is
based on color and firmness? - [Mark] Color, firmness, dryness. - [Katie] Dryness. - [Mark] Did you wanna try one? - [Katie] Oh my gosh, this is amazing. - [Mark] You could try that color first. - [Katie] So this is premium. - [Mark] This is the premium grade, right. - It's so sweet, and like salty. - [Mark] Straight out of the shell. And this is--
- Wow. - [Mark] A little bit more orange-ish. - Wow, I've never had it
this fresh ever before. - [Mark] A little bit different. - It's very subtle, but
it is 100% a difference. - Yeah, out of about 1,000
pounds of sea urchin, we get maybe five to ten
trays of the premiums, so-- - Wow. So what are the different grades? Premium-- - We do premium, number one,
number two, number three. It goes into the alum soaking tank. The alum is a firming agent. - How long does that take? - Sometimes it's as quick as ten minutes, sometimes it's, you know, 40 minutes. - 'Cause it's all about
the texture, you know. - Texture and then, you know you want to keep the juice in there too, just 'cause a lot of
the flavor is in that. (energetic techno music) We do the final cleaning stage. - [Katie] So you're
continuing to clean them. - Yup. This is Roberto. He's been with us for 37 years. - 37 years. So we're tweezing out
any remaining impurities. I am not a stranger to tweezer work. I've never been this
nervous doing tweezer work, 'cause I just am really
trying not to damage the uni. I'm beginning to understand
why that little wooden tray-- - Mm-hm, costs so much. - Costs so much. Where is all this uni going? - We do a lot of
restaurants in Los Angeles, we do a lot of wholesale. - [Katie] You can order this online. - Yeah. - How am I doing? Too slow? - No, no, no, it's okay. (laughs) - [Katie] Too slow. - Clean again. - This was probably one of my trays. Gimme two seconds, gimme 30 minutes. Ooh, one stack. So now we are finally
at the packaging stage. This is what I'm used to seeing. - And this is that premium grade we were talking about earlier. Anywhere from five to ten
trays every 1,000 pounds. - Wow, how much is this retail? - This retail we sell it for $85. And it's 250 grams. - Wow. - These we deliver to the restaurants. - Within a day of coming out of the water. - Right. A lot of the restaurants,
they make the mistake of, even the sushi restaurants, while they're using it, they leave it out on the counter. And they leave it out for like an hour. Or even in the kitchen. So that will affect the
taste and the shelf life. This is Bertha, Katie. She's been with us for 40 years. - [Katie] 40 years, from the beginning. - From the beginning. We only have maybe two or three ladies that pack this tray. - [Katie] Right. (energetic techno music) - [Mark] Did you make that? That was yours? - Yeah. - [Mark] Not bad. - Hard judgment going on right now. It's an unbelievable amount of work to get it to this point. - We also have another
uni which is no alum. It's all natural. - Oh, wow. - Completely straight out of the shell like you had over there. - Right. - The first two pieces that you had. I'm gonna show you that station. - So over here we're going straight from getting them out of
the shell and cleaning and we're keeping them in that salt water that they were just pulled from. - Yup, 100 gram trays of water packs. (energetic techno music) - [Katie] Wow, so who's buying this stuff? - [Mark] This, it goes to a a
lot of our retail customers. And right now there's some restaurants that are catching on. - I didn't even know
this existed until now. - Not many people do, so that's why I'm glad I was
able to tell you about it. - [Katie] It's really cool to see this. - [Mark] This here is a metal tray. These are 100 gram trays. And they're a little bit more compact. - [Katie] So then from here,
these are packed for FedEx. - [Mark] Yeah, yeah. - [Katie] Okay. - [Mark] So this is what Katie made today. - Four packages of uni, going to Eater. (tape ripping) This was a really special one for me because my whole career in kitchens, I received that little
wooden box of perfection. - Right. - But I never knew what went into it. How it got to that point. So this was really, really cool to see it from the beginning. Thanks for watching this
episode of How to Make It. For more episodes, click here. And we're going straight down. - We're going straight down, we gonna make a cylinder now. (whirring of chainsaw motor)",8:20
c25eRhYDXa8,TheWarOwl,VideoGames,The Greatest Counter Play in the History of Counter-Strike,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c25eRhYDXa8,2 years ago,2M views,VideoGames,feel free to use demos POVs for making your video content on the YouTube that's from starladder okay so i have direct communication giving me permission to muse the go TV demos to make the videos on the youtube so everybody just calm down alright no DMCA's stop being a dick starladder greetings I the war al greets you congratulations to Australis for reviving their top form play for at least a week ends and winning the major championship I put forth that their match against Team Liquid in the quarterfinals is a masterclass of competitive gamesmanship and the greatest counter play in the history of counter-strike in a major that was plagued with the lowest viewership numbers since 2014 the most anti-climatic grand final evolve time and awful awful observing there were some cool games the most interesting of these happen during the grand final between Australis and liquid which somehow was played during the quarterfinals of the tournament not sure if there was a schedule mix up there or something like that this was the match that everybody was looking forward to the pick'm predictions were 51 to 49 percent we were kind of robbed of this meet up by ences miracle tournament run last major whoever was to win this matchup would most likely be the major champions going into the Berlin major Team Liquid was the team to beat they were the number one highest rated team had a historic 26 match winning streak and best of threes and a 100% win rate on vertigo the newest map added to professional counter-strike Australia's had since fallen out of form they had gone from downright scary back-to-back major champions to sharing the shadows with upcoming ends and vitality while Team Liquid reveled in the spotlight it was clear going into the major that Australis had one objective to knock liquid off their high horse assuming they'd be facing them at some point I believe they worked very hard to devise a plan to kill the king nobody saw it coming not professional analysts not even Team Liquid certainly not me map vetoes can give a team a massive advantage if they play it right it started off with Mirage being banned by Australis and then train being banned by liquid not a big surprise but then Australia started to take form when they picked vertigo vertigo a map that Team Liquid was undefeated on a map that had just seen a big update from valve I think this pic immediately tilted team what were they planning had liquid properly prepared on this map against Astralis in particular it was all just a big question mark going into it this video is about vertigo the 200 IQ map Vito pick that astral is seemingly specifically prepared against teamliquid vertigo recently saw an important patch that reworked many areas of the map the timings for the terrorists were delayed just enough for a Stralis to change how the map was played on the CT side but first they saw themselves on the terrorists side charged with taking bomb sites offer the best team in the world is started off with liquid taking a commanding lead on the first three rounds putting a Stralis into a save it was only thanks to a great individual play by device that they were able to steal their first point once we got into the gun rounds of pattern developed with a Stalinist Eastside setup they left absolutely no holes in their defense if their player mid got smoked off and couldn't watch the latter room a player would immediately rotate and be in position to watch later' if they had an OP they set up device in a defensive off boost at bottom a they'd sometimes send two players to be stairs and set up a crossfire but just for the first few moments of the round there was no way for a CT to be able to get a good forward position to pick players off early on despite this liquid was still able to play a good CT side in this round notice how a Stralis is well aware of a leash pushing in and reacts perfectly to it it was only thanks to Alicia's world-class play that he was able to take the 2k it almost seemed like a Stralis were paranoid of some CT aggression by liquid but that aggression never came liquid calmly played the bombsites rotated between and launched some successful retakes if you rotate on vertigo you have to walk the entire way because your footsteps will be heard because of this when astral is rotated to do a bomb I take they committed to that bomb site take and through brilliant use of utility and positioning were able to pull off some outstanding wins while the half ended with an even score line of eight seven in favor of Australis it did become clear that a Stralis had been strongly practicing this map doing what was quite possibly the most daring trick in the history of counter-strike meanwhile on Team Liquid when a Stralis gone to the CT side everything changed round 17 fast CT aggression on a ramp glaive gets into position before the terrorists have a chance to figure out what is going on the new T spawn timings added by valve allow for this to happen liquid cleans it up they are the best team in the world after all but they then decide to rotate to be in a three versus two instead of continuing on to a hmm Dupree has taken the opportunity to get into a sneaky spot if liquid had played like Australis did and just continued on into the bomb site Australis would have saved and liquid would be victorious round 18 two players put aggression on elevator and Dupree pushes into B stairs once Dupree is figured out he hides and the two elevator players quickly rotate to clean it up we didn't see anything like this from liquid round 19 naff who watches mid chutes out the skylights to throw some clever flashes and assists his team majus coheres the skylights being shot out simply runs by it's a ladder room this this right here tells me that a Stralis play was specifically prepared counter strats just running by here DRI is such a bad idea since a player is normally watching it but the tell of the skylight glass breaking told majus that he had a few seconds to sneak by an oh boy did it work out [Music] around 20 liquid put some early aggression on b-but Astralis hears it and doesn't peek now playing a little bit more passively since there's a bunch players sitting right outside but with nobody watching a device sneaks is way down effectively shutting off this side of the map and allowing a Stralis to hold for on B again if liquid played like a Stralis did on the T side this couldn't have happened round 21 nobody watches bottom be too late Dupree gets onto stairs Oh liquid you're catching on Matt just gets the trade and liquid sets up for an a take but oh no majus no pushes through be about to flank and a leash watches the hard flank this was a great round for liquid they finally caught on what the heck was going on and they played it right it was the only T side round that they would win around 22 same aggression ramp as round 17 all players are in position to trade perfect coordination [Music] device whose falling back then hides at concrete with an op what a play what a calculation what a risk a single Molotov have it in their inventory it's a common Molotov but they don't even check it did Australis know that liquid doesn't check concrete late into the round did device calculate that they wouldn't assume an opera would go play concrete's or did device just get very lucky I contend that there's just too many instances of this kind of play working here for it to just be luck fast aggressive CT side positioning keeping track of enemy movements through sound to push behind enemy lines and prevent any Teesside rotates the most interesting thing to me about this CT side play from Australis is that if they had played it against a Stralis t side it wouldn't work a Stralis CT side perfectly played against liquid steel side which makes their map pick of vertigo and their specific preparation the greatest counter play in the history of counter-strike [Music] a counter strand like this is only gonna work once can Australis maintain form for their next meeting and defeat liquid in a straight-up match this is not the end of the age of liquid this is not a revival of the age of Australis but this could be the beginning of one of the most interesting rivalries in the history of the game if a Stralis attends events megamans were much watching I am the war owl and I still have no closer [Music] for once can I make one of these videos where liquid actually wins oh by the way Stewie 2k was on cloud nine this counts as cloud nine part two we're done,10:33

daylight savings time it got dark pretty early but the ones we did put in the pool got ginormous so this is pretty awesome these 30 orbeez fill up like about the palm of my hands and we have 10 million of these noted so we still have 97 million orbeez and we're going to lay them on these tarps it's going to rain for 10 hours tonight and hopefully the rain will land on the tarps all 97 million will get big and this backyard will be full let's do that so garrett how many orbeez do you think we put in the pool probably like a million i know and look how many that's only a million wow

mht-1c4wc0Q,PBS Space Time,Science,What Happens at the Event Horizon? | Space Time | PBS Digital Studios,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mht-1c4wc0Q,5 years ago,2.9M views,Science,"This episode is supported
by The Great Courses Plus. At the event horizon
of the black hole, space and time are
fundamentally changed. Even professional
physicists disagree on what we expect to happen there. But there is a powerful
tool in physics that can give us real
intuition into the true nature of the event horizon. Its time you learned it. Black holes, objects
with densities so high that there's
this region, the event horizon, where the
escape velocity reaches the speed of light. Nothing that falls
below the event horizon can never escape and
is lost to the universe forever while we see falling
objects freeze as time stands still at the horizon. And anything that happens
below the event horizon stays below the event horizon. That's the official
sanitized public version. It's not entirely
inaccurate, but the reality is, of course, a good deal
more complex and interesting. Even ignoring the complications
of Hawking radiation or black hole rotational
growth, the simplest black hole of Einstein's general theory
of relativity-- purely gravitational,
static, and eternal-- is a subtle and
misunderstood beast. But we can come to a powerful
and intuitive understanding of the beast. Today I want to teach you
how to use the same tool that physicists use. It's a tool that
will let us easily and so the most common
questions about black holes. For example, are objects falling
through the event horizon really physically frozen
there from the point of view of the outside universe? Would you see the
entire future history of the universe playing
fast forward at the instant that you crossed
the event horizon? And do you see anything
at all once you're inside the black hole? The tool that will
answer these questions is called the Penrose
diagram, sometimes also the Carter Penrose diagram. It's a special type of
space-time diagram designed to clarify the
nature of horizons. But first, a quick refresher
on basic space-time diagrams. By graphing time versus
just one dimension in space, we can look at the
limits of our access to the universe due
to its absolute speed limit, the speed of light. With the right choice
of space and time units, the speed of light
becomes a diagonal line on the space-time diagram. The area encompassed by the
so-called light-like paths defines all future events
or space-time locations that we could potentially travel
to or influence constrained by the cosmic speed limit. That's our forward light cone. Our past light cone
defines the region of the past universe that could
potentially have influenced us. Let's drop a black hole
onto our space-time diagram. It lives at x=0
on the space axis, but exists through all
the times on the graph. It has a point of infinite
density, the singularity, and an event horizon
a bit further out. The mass of the black hole
stretches space and time so that light rays
appear to crawl out of the vicinity of
the event horizon before escaping to
flat space-time, no longer following
45 degree paths. Now let's throw a monkey
into the black hole. As it approaches
the event horizon, its future light cone bends
towards the black hole as fewer and fewer of
its possible trajectories lead away. Below the event horizon,
all possible trajectories lead towards the singularity. The problem with the
regular space-time diagram is that the path of light and
the shape of the light cone changes as space-time
becomes warped. That makes it
difficult to figure out what parts of the past
and future universe the monkey can
witness or escape to. And this is where the
Penrose diagram comes in. It looks like this. It transforms the regular
space-time diagram to give it two
powerful features. It crunches together,
or compactifies, the grid lines to fit infinite
space-time on one graph-- very useful for black holes. It also curves the
lines of constant time and constant space in what we
call a conformal transformation so that light always
follows a 45 degree path. That means light cones always
have the same orientation everywhere. Super handy for understanding
monkey trajectories. This is the Penrose
diagram for flat space-time with no black holes. Same as with a regular
space-time diagram, blue verticalish lines
represent fixed locations in one dimension of space
and red horizontalish lines are fixed moments in time. Now, those lines get
closer and closer together towards the edge of
the plot to encompass more and more space-time. They're extremely finely
separated at the edges so that any tiny
stretch on the graph represents vast
distances and/or times. The lines also converge
together towards the corners so that light travels a
45 degree path everywhere on the diagram. So a light ray starting
from really, really far away and coming towards us hugs
the edge of the diagram and crosses an enormous number
of time and space steps, only reaching us in our
very distant future. OK. Let's drop a black hole
into this space-time. Nice and safely far
off to the left. And because we only have
one dimension of space, and any motion to
the left brings us closer to the black hole. Its event horizon
becomes the end of the line in that direction. The future cosmic horizon
on the Penrose diagram is replaced with a
plunge into a black hole. The compactified
grid lines there now represent the
stretched space-time near the event horizon. An entirely new Penrose
region represents the interior of the black hole. Weirdly, the lines of constant
position and constant time switch. Space flows at greater than
the speed of light inwards, towards the central singularity. It becomes uni-directional,
flowing inexorably downwards, just as time flowed
inexorably forward in the outside universe. All paths lead to the
inevitable singularity. Once you're beneath the
horizon, your future light cone still represents all possible
paths that you could take. All of them end up
at that singularity. The only way to escape back
to the outside universe would be to widen
your light cone by traveling faster than light. So you're out of luck. Now that we've nailed
the Penrose diagram, we can use it to do some serious
black hole monkey physics. Our space-faring simian
begins its journey and emits a regular
light signal that we observe from a safe distance. As it approaches the black
hole, these light rays have further and further to
travel through increasingly curved space-time
and so the interval between receiving
signals also increases. The progress of
the monkey appears to slow to a halt very
close to the event horizon, and the final signal at the
moment of crossing never reaches us. It's trying to travel
at the speed of light against light speed
cascade of space-time. With this picture, we
can start to answer some very serious questions. First, what would happen
if the monkey remembered to fire its jet pack
at the last instant before reaching
the event horizon? Well, it could still escape. Its future light cone still
includes a tiny sliver of the outside universe. It had better be a good
jet pack because it's going need to follow a very
long near light speed path away. It will, nonetheless, have
experienced far less time than us when it emerges
into flat space-time in our far future. Assuming no jet
packs, the monkey is probably doomed to a
graceful reverse swan dive through the event
horizon, watching the entire future
history of the universe play out above it at
that last instant. Yet actually, no. It doesn't see that at all. The monkey's last view
of the outside universe is defined by its
past light cone that encompasses all of the
light that will catch up to it and that light is stuck
following these diagonal lines because it has to contend with
the same stretched space-time as the monkey. There's no future
universe spoiler promo. If it could instead hover
above the event horizon, then it would see the
universe in fast forward, although that view would be
compressed into a small circle directly overhead. Watching the monkey frozen
on the event horizon is going to make us feel a
bit guilty, after a while. Could we change our minds and
launch a daring monkey rescue mission? Sadly, no. Even if we do travel
at the speed of light, after a certain point there's
no catching the monkey. We would see it suspended
above the horizon as we're racing to meet
it, but it will always appear to be just a
little further ahead no matter how close to
that horizon we dare to go. Remember, the monkey
isn't actually above the horizon
for infinite time, it only appears that way
to us because as long as we're outside the
event horizon, no times that we can witness correspond
to the monkey crossing that horizon. In order to see
that crossing, we would have to cross the
event horizon ourselves. Once inside the black
hole, we could potentially see the monkey below us. All space-time
within the black hole is flowing toward the
singularity faster than the speed of light. The two neighboring
radial layers aren't traveling faster than
light relative to each other. That means that the monkey's
signal can still reach us, although it might be
more accurate to say that we catch up to the
monkey's outgoing signal. But even that so-called
outgoing light is still moving downwards, doomed to
hit the singularity along with the monkey and
our rescue mission. All of this describes a
non-rotating, uncharged black hole, a Schwarzschild
black hole. Even this simple case is a
good deal more complicated than I let on. For example, I only showed you
half of the Penrose diagram. The complete
mathematical solution for a Schwarzschild black hole
has two additional regions, one corresponding to
a parallel universe on the other side of
untraversable wormhole, the Einstein-Rosen Bridge. And down here we have
what we call a white hole. These are strange
mathematical entities and probably aren't
real, but we'll certainly come back to them. We'll also come
back to what happens if we set the
black hole spinning or add some electric charge. Then our Penrose
diagram blooms outwards to include potentially infinite
parallel regions of space-time. Thanks to The Great Courses Plus

I'm really looking forward to our hangouts. Your support is going to
make a big difference, as is the support at all levels. So thanks again to everyone
who's contributed on Patreon. And a quick announcement
of a couple of events I'll be at early next year. First, South by Southwest,
March 10 to 19 in Austin, Texas. A few months ago
I asked you guys to head to the South by
Southwest panel picker to vote for myself,
Astrophysicist Katie Mack, and It's OK to be
Smart's Joe Hanson to be picked for a panel titled,
""We are All Scientists."" Well, thanks to you
guys, we're scheduled. We're going to talk about
the value of and the threat to critical thinking
and scientific reasoning and why these skills
need to be seen as accessible and
important to everyone and how we can act on this idea. Also, for those of you thinking
of attending grad school in physics, I'll be talking
about studying physics at a professional level at the
City University of New York's Student Research Day, April
7 at the CUNY Graduate Center in New York City. More details closer to
then, but for now I'll put a link in the description
and feel free to reach out to me if you're interested. OK. Onto the comments from
last week's episode on De Broglie-Bohm theory. Wow. This is the closest I've seen
a YouTube comment section come to looking like a Q&A session
after a professional physics seminar. Now, a lot of you wondered why
I never mentioned the EM drive when talking about
pilot wave theory. The answer is simple,
there was nothing useful to say on
that connection. In the recent paper out
of Eagle Works Labs, Herald White and collaborators
present some results on the thrust produced
by their EM drive and then go on to talk about
how pilot wave theory might explain the apparent
conservation of momentum-breaking results. I might get into the details
in an upcoming episode, but for the sake of
explaining pilot wave theory this paper isn't relevant. The connection is
extremely speculative, and honestly I wondered
whether pilot wave theory was chosen partly because
the internet happens to love it at the moment. DinosaurFromtheFuture
asks how it can be that pilot wave theory
predicts different particle trajectories, given that the
particles supposedly all start at exactly the same point. Well, the simple answer is
that the particles don't start at exactly the same points. We just can't know exactly
their location at the beginning. See, pilot wave theory states
that the particle riding the wave does have a definite
position at all times and that position defines
its future directory. So if you know the
position perfectly and you know the wave
function, you can perfectly predict future locations. However, you can't perfectly
measure a particle position without changing
it slightly in ways that themselves aren't
perfectly predictable. As a result, you never know
exactly where a particle is. This uncertainty
leads to the range of potential future
trajectories, including trajectories
through one slit or the other. More generally, it
allows pilot wave theory to agree with Heisenberg's
uncertainty principle. In the Copenhagen
interpretation, the uncertainty
principle describes the intrinsic randomness
of the quantum world. De Broglie-Bohm
pilot wave theory states that this
uncertainty just arises from our
imperfect knowledge and that the universe
itself knows exactly where all these particles are. Vacuum Diagrams
correctly points out that to know the future
trajectory of a particle, you only need position, not
velocity, as I had stated. That velocity information
is in the guiding wave. Thanks for the correction
and thanks also for pointing out those extremely
interesting papers that detail certain failings of
the pilot wave interpretation. I'll link those and
a couple of others that take different sides in
the description of this video, as well as in the
pilot wave episode. In fact, there was some
really heated and fascinating discussion both for and against
the pilot wave interpretation and some of it was
from people who know a good deal more than
I do, like Vacuum Diagrams. Something I took from this
is that Bohmian mechanics is, on its own, very unlikely
to be the full picture, even ignoring the whole
relativity issue. That doesn't necessarily mean,
though, that it's not useful. I'll get back to why. But first, as was pointed out to
me in a nice email by physicist and science writer Adam Becker,
I wasn't entirely accurate when I said that De Broglie, the
founder of pilot wave theory, remained convinced by Niels
Bohr and his Copenhagen camp, even after Bohm's work. More accurately, De
Broglie remained convinced of the objections
raised against his idea, even after some of them were
addressed in Bohmian mechanics. To quote De Broglie
from his 1956 book, he, Bohm, assumes that
the [INAUDIBLE] wave is a physical reality,
even the [INAUDIBLE] wave in configuration space. I have already stated why
such a hypothesis appeared absolutely untenable to me. In fact, De Broglie
was never a huge fan even of his own
simplistic particle carried by a wave idea. That formulation was
a simplified version of what was to be a much more
intricate double solution theory in which the so-called
particle was actually a matter wave itself embedded in and
carried by the sine wave, represented by
the wave function. He was unable to pull
the math together in time for the fated
Solvay Conference, and so derived the simpler
description in which the particle is point-like. De Broglie never completed his
full double solution theory, but did work on
it intermittently throughout his life
and was inspired to return to it by
Bohm's publication, even if he didn't buy
Bohmian mechanics. The fact is we just don't
know whether the reality that drives the strange results
of quantum experiments is actually
deterministic in the way that we understand determinism. But De Broglie-Bohm
pilot wave theory is a great example of how
a deterministic theory can at least go some way towards
predicting the results of quantum experiments. Personally, I'm agnostic
towards the relative truth behind the Copenhagen,
many-worlds, pilot wave, or the other
interpretations of quantum mechanics. I like the idea of a
deterministic theory, but the universe has
often demonstrated that it couldn't care less
about our pet theories. However, it's also
shown itself to be vulnerable to experimentation
even for questions that we previously
thought untestable. We'll figure this out,
and until then it's OK to like one
theory over another but belief should
wait on the evidence. [MUSIC PLAYING]",19:59
Jl0IDXkYKbk,Eater,Food,How Miami’s Chocolate Master Creates the Perfect Bar of Chocolate — Handmade,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jl0IDXkYKbk,,10M views,Food,[Music] you can smell all the aroma come out when you crush them which is really nice all those beautiful chocolate flavors chocolate is happiness it's something that can you know really soothe your mind and soothe your soul i think for a long time we've grown up with this idea that chocolate is either dark or sweet and that's it chocolate can be a lot more just like wine just like fruits so this is basically how we receive the cacao the beans themselves are already fermented and dried and we bring from different farms throughout latin america and the caribbean and we keep them all single origin so chocolate is a fruit it grows on trees it comes from the cacao pod inside you'll find a pulpy fruit that is called bala it has the consistency of soursop and then the flavor of a lychee in our case what we're looking for is the actual seed part and that's the cocoa bean what ultimately will be transformed into chocolate this variety that we have from peru is from maranon it's considered to be one of the rarest cacaos in the world it was thought extinct for about a hundred years and it grew wild in that time it actually looks like milk chocolate because about 40 percent of the beans themselves are considered white beans or kind of caramel colored and then over in guatemala we also receive this variety which tastes a lot like oranges because they grow a lot of oranges on that particular farm so each farm and each country and even specific regions have different flavors we have chocolates that can be nutty earthy fruity and that's all coming from the soil where it's grown but also the bacteria that plays a role in its fermentation we will hand select all the best cocoa beans for us to use we're really looking to take out anything that's not a cacao sometimes we've got twin beans like these what will happen is they won't roast evenly at the end of the day we're trying to make a better product than what has been commercially available so to us this is very important you'll notice all these fissures inside the bean and that means that when the bacteria came in during the fermentation it really broke down the cell walls and it let all those flavors mix in so that's what we're really looking for is color flavor and fissures in terms of quality of cacao so we'll pat it down just to make sure it's even because we want an even roasting what happens in roasting is something called the malar reaction the amino acids and the sugars start to interact with the heat and it starts to develop the flavors and also the aroma that comes from the cacao so similar to sort of searing a piece of steak the same is happening with our cacao in that process we let it cool down usually for a few hours you have the shell which is called a husk and the nib is ultimately what becomes chocolate so a lot of people think that dark chocolate is bitter and the reality is when it's bitter it's typically over roasted which means that it's burnt that's why we medium roast it's lighter it's fruity you can taste all these different things and when we do chocolate tastings people can really appreciate that we have an ecuadorian that tastes like raisins we have a guatemalan that tastes like oranges and then we have our haitian that tastes super earthy so then we let the cacao rest from roasting and then we'll want a winnow and that process is simply cracking the bean and removing the shell you'll notice as most of the shell goes out towards the outside and then the nib stays in place because of how heavy it is so this is the machine that we use now shock has sort of been monopolized for so many decades so there's not really equipment that we can use as small craft producers we have a champion juicer from amazon and then we have a shop vac from home depot and the way it works is just like i was crushing it with a hammer the champion juicer will crush all the beans and instead of blowing air into it we have a vacuum which has that same method as the beans drop down they're crushed as air sucks in it'll take that lighter shell or husk up into here and then that heavier nib will fall down because it avoids the air that's blowing in there fifteen to twenty percent of the bean itself is husk which in most places becomes uh trash but we actually don't throw out a single piece of husk so one of the big ways that we found the home for them has been in beers it produces a different layer of flavor when they ferment the beer with it you can actually brew tea with it and it tastes almost like this earthy hot chocolate [Applause] so we're going to pre-mill it in order to make it a little bit smoother on our conjuring machines the friction is creating heat and the heat is activating the cocoa butter that's present in the bean and that's what will cause it to liquefy it starts to resemble when you start making brownie batter so now that same cacao oh suddenly is liquid this is what we would call a chocolate liqueur it's just a nib broken down so it's almost like a very chunky peanut butter very very astringent you sort of feel here the texture is quite gritty so we would need to smooth it out add sugar if we're going to make milk chocolate add milk in order to transform it into the chocolate we're used to i spent part of my childhood in barranquilla in colombia chocolate for colombians is simply made it's just very very good dark chocolate and that was something very satisfying and something that i really enjoyed and stuck with me for many years and then from there it'll go into our refiners so originally these machines are actually nut grinders so they're used primarily in india to make nut butters sometimes with peanuts in this machine you find two giant stone rollers and a granite slab and what they do is two things one refined down so it's smooth it's velvety like we're used to with chocolate the other thing it's doing is a process called conching and what it does is air is continuously moving in and out of the mixture and aerating it so very similar to when you open up a bottle of red wine and you let it breathe we're doing the same thing with the cacao all of those tannins those volatiles are evaporating as air comes in and it makes the chocolate milder as the process runs we'll let these run for about four days straight and it'll refine everything down is the sugar we use it's unrefined has more of a molasses taste to it sweetens the chocolate but doesn't overpower it [Music] in this middle machine we're making milk chocolates we added also cane sugar a little bit of cocoa butter for texture and then we added milk powder because we can't add any sort of liquids or anything that's water-based into our mixture otherwise it's sort of like when you add water to flour it will really not work well with the molecules in the cacao and then in here we're making white chocolate the one thing we don't have is any cacao nib so this is primarily based off cocoa butter unrefined cane sugar and milk powder so typically when you have milk powder it's this color i'm not a huge fan of that type of white chocolate so we like to do something here caramelized we actually take this milk and we slowly roast it in the oven it has a nice toasty note to it which is really delicious when we take the chocolate out of the machine at that point it is cover tour that's when most places would buy that finished product in order to make their items we use a filter which is actually meant for like honey and it's catching any nibs that we didn't refine and that way we have a final smooth product when you're producing tons and tons of chocolate each year you have to buy from a bunch of different places and blend it together in order to sell quantity those companies want the chocolate to always taste consistently the same so when you over roast you can maintain a consistency and then you can mask it with things like vanilla so that that's always what consumers taste in big manufacturing they're typically connected via tubes and chocolate has to travel from one side of the factory to the other so they'll use a lot of times lecithin to help it run smoother from one side to the next so it's really an aid in production we don't use any of those things because you're tasting exactly what they're producing on that farm from the soil from the environment versus just eating something that's blended together that has no different notes or flavor profiles from it that chocolate will solidify and we'll turn from this into this over the course of a day [Music] the cocoa butter that's present in all chocolates we eat is a six phase polymorphic crystal which means at any point it can be in six different types of stages at this stage it's not in its ideal form so that's why it creates these weird color patterns if you were to bite into it it would be sandy because of that textural change it'll alter the way you experience the chocolate it won't be as pleasant but if we're going to make any sort of bars or bon bons we'll have to temper it we've melted down the chocolate to about 40 42 degrees celsius to take out all those crystals that we don't want we're gonna slowly cool down the chocolate so we're using uh temperature and movement to form a crystal formation that will create a chocolate that is silky to your palate this is extremely important you can make the best tasting chocolate in the world but based on that texture will not be as good as when you have a good temper [Music] so the mixing is just adding the good crystals that we just formed in that batch into the rest of the chocolate that is untempered all the molecules get into formation form a little conga line and in doing so all of the chocolate molecules are in order and look nice [Music] one of the things that's very important is how we source most farmholders live under a dollar a day it's a very difficult industry for us it's really important to support these producers who are investing time money to produce something better they should be compensated for what they're doing we're not talking about fair trade we're going above that which is direct trade and being able to pay them more than that basic commodity price so we're gonna start the process of making bonbons this color is made out of cocoa butter which comes from the cacao bean it has a little bit of coloring in it and what we've done prior to this is tempered it in order for it to be shiny and glossy just like our chocolate has to go through that process [Music] so one of the things that makes us unique is that we're a bean to bond and that means that we produce all the chocolate that goes into our bon bons i actually am an organizational psychologist by training i worked as a management consultant [Music] i was in europe in paris and i had this amazing hot chocolate and it just seemed so simple yet well made i just couldn't stop thinking about what a great thing it was and how i wanted to bring to the u.s something similar to what i had tasted overseas so this ganache is made out of dark chocolate and then some rum and when it crystallizes we're able to do the final layer of chocolate which is the foot of the bonbon i would use a cover tour to play around and see how it worked i realized it was either too sweet it just didn't focus on the cacao it was blended it was a lot of the things that just didn't seem to highlight and recreate that experience that i had had with that hot chocolate i knew i wanted to take it all the way back to the bean making a product like this that's so labor-intensive by hand helps us control the process more from start to finish when we roast and we analyze we have more of a care after what we're doing as opposed to just everything being fed through a machine and it takes us about a week but it takes the farmers two to three years to grow the plants six months from the time the flower comes out till the pot is ready and then from when the pod gets cut another two weeks so it's a very long process behind each bar there's a farmer and a story behind all that and we want to make sure that we honor that we're talking years in the making to consume that final piece of chocolate that you buy and consume,14:10
em-pVICrnqM,Captain Disillusion,Informative,Marble Sorting Machine DEBUNK,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=em-pVICrnqM,3 years ago,4.5M views,Informative,"[Intro drumroll] Greetings, children. Captain Disillusion, here. So. You want to know the latest, coolest, most interesting viral thing from last month? There's this audio clip and depending on the frequency the listener is predisposed to pay attention to, They hear one of two very ordinary common everyday names Laurel or Yanny Which one do you hear?
[turns the tape recorder on] *Explosion* Holly: I know which one you hear D. It's Yanny, because I hear Laurel and opposites attract. C.D: Oh joy, Holly's here. 
Holly: How's my favorite dreamy pixel justice crusader? C.D: What do you want?
Holly: Oh, relax. Holly: I'm here on official business C.D: Glad to see you learn to create an artificial body instead of, you know... abducting a corpse. Holly: I've got a video I want you to explain 
C.D: Portraits? I don't do portrait videos. Holly: Oh, come on, it's your favorite kind: simple but perplexing, short, but high-quality, and freshly out of date. Look. It's a machine that sorts a pile of marbles by color, but there's no electronics. You just bounce through a bunch of pegs and all fall into the right place. How does it work? C.D: Since when do you care about techie stuff? Holly: I've always cared about interesting phenomena be they organic or technological in nature. C.D: Yeah. Well, it's fake. 
Holly: No, it's not. It's just a clever sciencey invention. Are you sure? C.D: *Clears throat* Yes, I am Holly, how are you not? You don't even have to look that closely, you can just listen. Thousands of marbles are cascading down through 75 pegs in this contraption; so, why does it sound like only a couple hundred? I can practically hear the gaps in the waveform between bounces, even though in the picture a bunch of marbles are mid bounce on any given frame. And toward the end, as the last few marbles fall through, we don't hear fewer individual bounces, just the same continuous sound fading down. Holly: Okay, but that doesn't automatically prove the video is fake C.D: No, but it doesn't bode well. And the video side raises plenty of its own questions. What is this thing? How is it constructed? The conveyor of little claws on the side looks like it's meant to load the marbles back to the top, but there's no axle to rotate it. How does it hang up there? How's it driven? Same with the hatch that releases the marbles. Where is the mechanism that opens and closes it? Holly: Hmm... true. There's not much there, but it looks so realistic. C.D: Sure, and if you dig up the original video, it even shows what most re-posted versions littering the web don't: A hand pressing a button to start the drop. Except it does it in a strange way. When I press a mechanical button, I tend to first train my finger right on it then push for just long enough to trigger it. This hand lands straight on the button from inches away and stays on it in a frozen pose for a weirdly long time. Holly: You're not saying the hand is fake? C.D: It's real, but projected on a 2D plane as part of a complete CG rendering that looks a heck of a lot like the work of Konstantin Otrembsky, A Russian digital artist who makes animated graphics for television. Holly: How in the world did you figure that out? C.D: I Googled it. It's on his YouTube and his Instagram, and even the secret Russian Instagram. The evidence is pretty compelling wouldn't you say? Holly: Yeah, I guess... C.D: What's the matter? 
Holly: It's just... I'm dying.
C.D: Oh? Holly: Well, not all the way dying just losing my powers. It seems fewer and fewer people engage in magical thinking anymore, and without their belief... I'm just not as strong as I'm used to being. C.D: Oh. Holly: But... I remembered you saying, or was it Carl Degrasse Dawkins? I don't know, one of you brilliant guys. That the real science based world is full of wonders. That there's greater magic in nature and the cosmos than any fantasy writer could ever dream up C.D: Yeah, that sounds like something one of us would say. Holly: So we want to learn it all! Mathematics, biology, physics, teach me! I'm a fast learner. C.D: Well, that's very admirable. I mean, physics is very much involved in the faking of this video. Holly: Really? 
C.D: Yeah, after all it was done with a physics simulation. When you need to animate a ton of objects falling and colliding with each other, you don't want to do it by hand. Instead, you set up all the physical conditions for the scene virtually and then run a simulation of what would happen. Lots of 3D software can run physics sims, but they're not always perfect. The start of a simulation can be shaky as all the forces suddenly activate. Some objects might jitter and pop. When the marbles are first released in Konstantin's simulation, one stray one at the top bounces up inexplicably. Another giveaway of a simulation shows up when something's slightly off in the delicate recipe of scale, gravity, object mass, and other settings. The hand gives us a good scale reference for the marbles being less than a quarter inch in diameter. If that's true, these individual bounces seem too high and slow to me. It's as if the marbles are impossibly light or have stronger than normal air resistance Maybe this was necessary to arc direct them into filling all the slots at the bottom evenly, but artistic license is not valid in the state of believable hoax Holly: That's so cool. Umm, while you were explaining that I some googling and these things are actually called Galton Boards. They're are all about probability. How many marbles will fall into each slot, and there's actually a formula to- C.D: Exactly! So how could this one possibly sort color? Holly: It can't, it's fake. You're right. But some people have made some really interesting designs for actual marble sorting devices There's this brilliantly simple one by pocket83, that just uses gravity to sort marbles by size. Or this cute one by alexpikkert, which has a color sensor driven by an Arduino board. I bet if we put our heads together, we could figure out how to build a version of Konstantin's galton board that actually works. C.D: Yeah, probably. But that's not what he did. He faked it. With visual effects. Holly: Right. C.D: The question is ""how?"" What were the steps? And the answer is as follows. First: He shot an empty background plate. Probably not with a phone, The rolling shutter is too extreme on those to do accurate motion tracking, which is what he did next. Then he made a 3D model of the galton board and placed it in the scene. Now, because the marbles are spherical and featureless, He didn't even have to run a proper rigid body simulation to calculate how they fall. Their rotation doesn't matter. So he just linked each marble to a particle, an infinitely small point on which he set the boundary of influence to the radius of the marbles. This type of simulation is much simpler. The primitive particles fall and the marbles just come along for the ride. Holly: Wait, how did you just show that? The empty background and unrendered models? C.D: Oh, I... found them... C.D: Oh, I... found them... on Konstantin's Vimeo page. Holly: We can get Adafruit optical RGB sensors for $8.99 a piece, and I think I have a concept for a sorting mechanism that uses vibrating pegs. Although I will have to do some more research on resonance, there might be some issues there; but I can go get all the materials right now. C.D:  Wait a minute. I don't just look things up! I deduce! There's much more to it. I mean even with everything I explained so far, you don't know exactly how he faked the actual color sorting, do you? Holly: I guess not. C.D: And you want to know, don't you? Holly: Sure... C.D: Well, small adjustments might affect a simulation every time it runs, making individual marbles fall differently. Not something you want if you plan to render the scene multiple times, or have an exactly predictable end state for all the moving objects. But unlike in the real world, CG physics can be baked. Converted from on-the-fly calculations to keyframed animation, fixed permanently on every frame. Once the path of each particle was fixed, all Konstantin had to do was go to the end of the shot, select each group of marbles, and give it a different tint. In other words... 
Holly: He did it backwards. C.D: No, he did it in rever- Yes, exactly! See? It's all about thinking outside the box, working with the information you have to come up with the most likely scenario. I might not have found the creator of the video, the simulation could have been flawless. But I'd still spot something that gives away the video's fakeness. Some fundamental clue that makes the whole thing impossible. Like for instance, the fact that before most of the marbles have fallen, they block the view through the board; allowing us to focus on the perfectly clear reflection in its flat, glossy surface. A reflection, that despite facing us directly, shows no camera phone, or a person holding it. Holly: D... My body is already a hologram. I have enough visual effects in my life. I want to go further, observe and figure out things about the universe that aren't known yet. C.D: Well, I... Can't help with that... Holly: I know. But now I'm afraid it's time for me to go, kids. An accountant in Irkutsk is about to follow her weekly horoscope advice with disastrous results! Holly: Oh, wow! Mu Cephei's core is finally about to collapse! I've got to get to my observatory in the Elephant's Trunk Nebula to take real-time readings of the supernova! C.D: Okay, that's a little cooler. I guess I'll see you around. Holly: Yeah, I'll be back. C.D: Maybe you can teach me some of this fancy stuff you're gonna learn, sometime. Holly: I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friend zone. C.D: Remember, love with your heart, 
Holly: Use your head for everything else.",11:03

It was a car accident. Nothing particularly remarkable. But fatal, none the less. It was a painless death. The medics tried their best to save you... but to no avail. Your body was so utterly shattered, you were better off. Trust me. And that's when you met me. What happened? Where am I? You died. I said, matter of factly. No point in mincing words. There was... there was a truck. And it was skidding. Yes. I... I died? Yes. But don't feel bad about it. Everyone dies. You looked around. There was.. nothingness. Just you, and me. What is this place? Is this, the afterlife? More or less. Are you.. God? Yes. I'm God. My kids.. My wife... What about them? Will they be alright? ""That's what I like to see,"" I said. You just died, and your main concern is for your family. That's good stuff right there. You looked at me with fascination. To you, I didn't look like God. I just looked like some man, or possibly a woman. Some vague authority figure maybe. ""Don't worry,"" I said. They'll be fine. Your kids will remember you as perfect in every way. They didn't have time to grow contemptuous of you. Your wife will cry on the outside. But will be secretly relieved. To be fair, your marriage was falling apart. If it's any consolation, she'll feel very guilty for feeling relieved. Oh.. So what happens now? Do I go to Heaven? Or Hell or something? Neither. You'll be reincarnated. Ah.. So the Hindus were right! All religions are right in their own way. Walk with me. You followed along as we strolled through the void. Where are we going? No where in particular. It's just nice to talk while we walk. So, what's the point then? When I get reborn, I'll just be a blank slate right? A baby? So, all my experiences and everything... everything I did in this life... Won't matter... Not so. You have within you, all the knowledge and experiences of all your past lives. You just don't remember them right now. I stopped walking, and took you by the shoulders. Your soul is more magnificent, beautiful, and gigantic than you can possibly imagine. A human mind can only contain a tiny fraction of what you are. It's like sticking your finger in a glass of water. To see if it's hot or cold. You put a tiny part of yourself into the vessel, and when you bring it back out, you've gained all the experiences it had. You've been in a human for the last 48 years. So you haven't stretched out yet and felt the rest of your immense consciousness. If we hung out here for long enough, you'd start remembering everything. But there's not point to doing that between each life. How many times have I been reincarnated then? Oh, lots! Lots and lots! And into lots of different lives. This time around, you'll be a Chinese peasant girl in 540 A.D Wait... What?! You're sending me back in time? Well I guess technically. Time as you know it, only exists in your universe. Things are different where I come from. Where... where you come from? Oh sure, I come from somewhere. Somewhere else. And there are others like me. I know you'll want to know what it's like there but honestly you wouldn't understand. ""Oh.."" You said, a little let down. But wait.. If I get reincarnated to other places in time, I could have interacted with myself at some point. Sure, happens all the time. And with both lives only aware of their own lifespans, you don't even know it's happening. or who will ever live,  yes I'm Abraham Lincoln? and your john wilks booth too? (i didn't get what he said) I'm Hitler!!! You said appalled And you're the millions he killed. I'm Jesus! and you're everyone who followed Him. You fell silent* Every time you victimizing someone you're victimizing myself every act of kindness you've done you've done to yourself every happy and sad moment ever experienced by any human was or will be experienced by YOU you thought for a long time why?  why do all this? because someday you will become like me because that's what you are! you're one of my kind You're my child! Wow!! you said incredulous.. you mean i'm a God? No, not yet, you're a fetus you're still growing. once you've lived every human life throughout all time you will have grown enough to be born so the whole universe... it's just... an egg I answered.. now it's time for you to move on to your next life and I sent you on your way (this is the final clip of this video, made by Kurzgesagt subscribe to him!!!)",7:55
NDjNX3nEfYo,SomeGoodNews,News,The Office Cast Reunites for Zoom Wedding: Some Good News with John Krasinski (Ep. 7),1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDjNX3nEfYo,,17M views,News,"Emily Blunt: Good evening everyone and welcome back
to SGN. I'm John Krasinski and now- John Krasinski: What the heck? Em, what are you doing? Good
evening, everyone, and welcome back to SGN. I'm John Krasinski, and what the heck
just happened? Well, while we figure it out, let's get straight to the good news.
And luckily for me, the good could be found just about everywhere as it became
abundantly clear heading into week 7 that people are now rallying and taking
quarantine into their very own hands. ""Hey boys, when we going on a run though?"" ""Yeah, it's on."" ""Let's do this."" And unbeknownst to the rest of the world,
over on TikTok the Olympics are still going on. In Kansas City, something magical is
happening. In order to keep their neighborhood spirits high, the Perry
family is raising their daughter even higher. And speaking of raising spirits, when
these three sisters stare quarantine right in the face, it goes a little
something like this. And that brings us to our
favorite good news story of the week. In Sioux Falls, South Dakota,
eleven-year-old Emerson is known for the letters she writes to the ones she loves.
Why? Well these aren't just any old letters. One day after sending a whole bunch of
letters throughout quarantine, Emerson decided that one person in particular
deserved one of her special letters - her mailman, Doug. Well, Doug took that letter and showed it
to all his fellow employees at the United States Postal Service. It meant so
much to everyone, they wanted to write back. And just like that, good news spreads
fast. And it's time now once again for a check on the weather. Emma,
how's it looking out there? Emma Stone: Looks...looks pretty good. John: Thanks, Emma. And that brings
us to a segment we like to call: ""Love in the Time of Quarantine."" Because through
these difficult times, through all the anxiety, through all the confusion, the
one constant that we've seen is that one of life's greatest cliches proves
exactly why cliches are usually the truth. And so it has never been more
clear to us here at SGN that love will conquer all. ""I love you."" ""I love you."" ""Oh my god!"" And let's all not forget that one of the
most tangible, and certainly the cutest symbols of love, are still arriving every
single day. And not even quarantine can stop one of
life's greatest opportunities to celebrate love, weddings. ""With this ring."" ""With this ring."" ""You may
now kiss your bride."" Do you reaffirm your promise to dad?  And to put your full faith and trust in him so long as you both shall live?"" ""I do."" ""Dad?"" ""I do."" ""You missed the question yet."" And now on a personal note, perhaps my
favorite love story of the week was a couple down in Maryland whose wedding
proposal was oddly familiar. For more on that story, we go now to our
love will conquer all correspondents, Susan and John. Hi guys. It is so nice to
meet you guys. John: ""Yeah absolutely."" Susan: ""Oh my God, it's amazing."" John K: ""This is making my day."" John: ""Yeah, ours too.""
John K.: ""You sent in, I think the greatest proposal video I've ever seen."" Susan: ""Yes, he did so good."" John K.: ""Congratulations guys, you now have proved
that that proposal works a hundred percent of the time now. You just made that. So I have to hear the story. Tell me the story, what happened?"" John: ""So I knew the proposal needed to be something really special, but also really
something unique, and you know The Office has been something that has
connected the two of us for a very, very long time. So it just felt right."" John K.: ""That is awesome."" Susan: ""And then he got down on one knee and he was like 'You know, just like
Jim, I can't wait any longer.'"" John K.: ""Come on now. That's the stuff, John. That's that sweet, sweet stuff. Well, you know, in your tweet you would asked if I
would attend, right. 'If I'm able to attend,' I think was the wording."" John: ""That's true."" John K: ""Which is very polite, very
Southern polite, I liked it. The truth is I am able to attend, but only if we do it
right now. You think I'm kidding, but I just got
ordained as a minister for you guys, and I'm sure you're wondering to yourself,
I'm sure you're like, 'What do we need for this?' I mean, you probably need some parents to be here. John: ""Yep."" John K: ""I think I can do parents. Hold on ."" Susan: ""Mom! Daddy!"" John K: ""That's your mom and dad."" John: ""Hello guys."" John K.: ""Okay, you also need other parents. John, you have parents, don't you?"" John: ""I do."" John K: ""Here we go. Boom. We are officially one big happy family and a stranger. All right, all right. Are
we ready to get this party started? No, we are not. We need a bridesmaid, a
groomsman. Come on guys, it's just standard. Boom. Patricia and Tom, your best friends."" John: ""I really should have put on a shirt and tie, huh?"" John K: ""No, no, that's the best part. You don't need that. Whew. We are now cooking with gas.
But we are not done. Johnny, you need a best man. I got you. Susan. You are going
to need a maid of honor. Patricia, I'm sorry, but just for today we have someone
else in mind. Ladies and gentlemen, my dear friend, Jenna Fischer."" Susan: ""Oh my God. Jenna you look gorgeous!"" Jenna: ""It's your wedding day. I had to get dressed up. I don't know what your wedding colors are, but I went with pink and white."" Susan: ""That's it, you git it."" John: ""That actually is our colors."" John K.: ""Now Sid, let's
get real. Okay. I know this whole social distancing thing has thrown a real wrench
in the whole walking your daughter down the aisle thing. But I think I have a
pretty good back-up plan. I don't know if you guys are country
fans, but a good friend of mine has written a song for exactly this occasion
in his name is Zac Brown. When I asked him he said, 'Oh, I have this new song and
you're throwing a wedding. That sounds perfect for me."" Zac Brown: ""Absolutely, that's what
it's about. Congratulations."" John & Susan: ""Thank you."" John K.: ""We're going to kick off this ceremony. Here
we go. Guys. She's walking down the aisle to Zac Brown."" Susan: ""Daddy."" [Music] ""Most nights I try to pack, got you climbing on my back saying, 'Daddy, when am I going to see you again?' You know I got to go out on the road and get on the show so most nights your mama's going to tuck you in. When you're missing me look at the stars up there, I'll be on the same one's saying this fathers prayer, I hope you see the seven wonders, I hope you sail the seven seas, I hope you let the whole world in your heart, but you still got room for me. I hope you find a guy who treats you right, on your wedding night I'll raise a toast, hope he understands I'll always be the man that loves you the most."" John K.: ""C'mon everybody."" Zac: ""Congratulations."" Susan & John: ""Thank you."" John K: ""That was amazing. Zac, thank you so much for doing that.
I think you made me cry harder than anyone, oh my gosh. Okay, I gotta pull it together because we are heading into the meat of this thing. That's right. John, grab Susan's hand because this is happening. You are about to get virtually
married. John, do you take Susan to be your lawfully wedded wife, to love,
protect, and defend ,as long as you both shall live? John: ""I do."" John K.: ""Susan, do you take John
to be your lawfully wedded husband, to love, protect, and defend as long as you
both shall live?"" Susan: ""I do."" John: ""By the power vested in me by this piece of paper, and
seemingly the state of Maryland, I now pronounce you husband and wife.
John, you may now kiss the bride. Ladies and gentlemen, the Lushes. I've been waiting to say that forever."" Sid: ""Congratulations to the lucky couple."" Susan: ""I love you, daddy."" ""Wish you all the best."" Sid: ""My new son-in-law, I never thought it would happen."" Jenna: ""Here's all I'm gonna say. One day your kids are gonna assume that their
parents are soul mates, and in your case, they will be right. Congratulations you
guys."" Susan: ""Thank you."" John K.: ""I didn't make a speech, but I did want to do this to commemorate
the day. That is just for you guys. All right. I haven't done that
but once in my life. This is coming to you to put on the wall. If you even want that."" John: ""We do."" John K: ""I don't even know where to go from here. That's a lie, I do. And guys, there's only
one way out of this wedding, and Susan and John, because you so elegantly ripped off our show for your proposal, I feel like it's only fitting that you rip off
the wedding too. So let's rock. Well we can't play this song unless you let me invite
some of my family to the party. Ladies and gentlemen, the cast of The Office. Susan: ""Oh my gosh!"" John K.: ""John and Susan, congratulations. Yes. Thank
you so much for being a part of this. You're not only good sports and a
beautiful couple, but you also represent all the other beautiful couples in the
world who are going through the exact same thing. So we here at SGN are here
for you, and we're here for them. Congratulations to all, thank you so much.
What a beautiful night. And that will do it, not only for this episode of SGN, but
for the first and only SGN wedding, because, let's be honest, how does it get
better than that? It doesn't. This is SGN. I'm John
Krasinski asking you to remember no matter how hard things get, there is
always good in the world. We will see you next time. Good night.",18:23
7NZ9X9A2efA,Top Gear,"Automobile,Comedy",Top Gear : Bugatti Veyron vs Euro Fighter - Top Gear - BBC,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NZ9X9A2efA,13 years ago,38M views,"Automobile,Comedy","Yeah... Now a year ago, Jeremy raced
James and me from Italy to London. James and I in his ridiculous aeroplane
and Jeremy in a Bugatti Veyron. And, annoyingly, he won. Then we heard from a bunch
of aeroplane enthusiasts called the RAF. They said, ""Why don't you come up
to our place and we've got you a plane that'll give your car a run
for its money."" And seeing I'm the only one
who hasn't yet driven the Bugatti Veyron, I took up the challenge. Yes, the 1,000 horsepower legend is back
and if I'm honest, I'm a bit nervous. Not because of the car itself, but because of the burden
that now rests on my shoulders. When Jeremy drove the Veyron, all he had to beat was an incompetent
James and a useless little aeroplane. Then when James went to Germany
and maxed it, the car didn't even break sweat. But this time,
the Veyron's honour's really at stake because never before has it gone up
against something like this. The most modern, the most hi-tech
strike fighter on the planet, the Eurofighter Typhoon. And for once when it comes to figures,
the Bugatti really is top-trumped. Its twin engines develop
20,000 lb of thrust each, punching the Eurofighter up to 65,000 feet and a top speed
of over 1,500 miles an hour This machine is the cutting edge
of what a plane can do. It's actually designed
to be aerodynamically unstable to make it as
agile as possible in a dogfight. So, it needs 70 computers
to keep it in the air and if they fail,
it would simply fall out of the sky. It's kind of a mix of science fiction
and brute strength. These wings, for example, have to be able
to take the stresses and strains of all those extreme
high-speed manoeuvres. They might look slim, but each one can
take the weight of 35 Volkswagen Golfs. All in all, a handy bit of kit,
as you'd expect at £67 million a pop. Faced with the clear and present danger
of the Eurofighter, the Bugatti Veyron is the car world's
best shot at clinging to some honour. And no one knows what the outcome will be. In fact, Bugatti is so concerned they've sent over not one,
but two Veyrons. Maybe they're going to tie them together
or something. The shoot-out will take place here, on the main runway
at RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire. And here's the challenge. It's a horizontal
versus vertical drag race over two miles. Here's the start-finish line
and the car and the plane. Yeah, it's difficult to get hold of models
of a Veyron and a Eurofighter. They both start from here. The car
will race down the runway for a mile. When it reaches the mile marker,
turn as quickly as possible, and then race back down over the same mile
to cross the start-finish line here. Meanwhile, the plane will set off
and take off as quickly as possible and cover a mile, vertically, obviously. When it's done the mile, it turns
and swoops back down the same mile to cross the start-finish line. Or to crash into a million-pound supercar
it didn't expect to see and YouTube has a field day. Otherwise, it's last one to finish
is a vegetarian. Simple as that. Now, you might think
the plane is going to walk it. But don't be so sure. The car should have the edge off the line. It'll do nought to 100 in 5.7 seconds,
for God's sake. And when it gets to these yellow dots, which mark the mile point
where it has to turn around, the Veyron has another advantage. Down here its awesome brakes
should come into play. And then there's the air brake as well,
which, on its own, generates the same stopping power
as you'd get in a normal hatchback. A straight line is a straight line. So, the car does what it does there. But up here I've got to brake
as late as possible and lose as little time as possible
making the turn, before the return mile. So, I reckon it'll be won or lost
here at this end. Traction control off,
gearbox to manual, launch control left foot on brake,
give it the full beans on the throttle... This is it. Stand by one, give me 20 seconds. As drag races go, you will agree,
this is quite a good one. We are away! We're neck and neck! I'm getting away! I can't believe I'm looking in... Wow! I can feel the wash from the jet! And there it goes! So, I'm fighting for the Germans
in a battle against the RAF! If you're watching thinking,
this is cool... it is. After just 18 seconds,
I was doing 188 miles an hour and getting ready
to brake for the mile turn. That's as late as I dare. This is where it's won or lost. I'm on the return mile now. This is the best race in history. If I mess this up,
I may as well get a paper round. I was doing 196 miles an hour,
but was it enough? I must still be ahead.
I can't see the plane. No! No! I suspect I may get some abuse for this.",8:42

b81Cr97ANrk,BuzzFeedVideo,Entertainment,The Try Guys Try Labor Pain Simulation • Motherhood: Part 4,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b81Cr97ANrk,6 years ago,35M views,Entertainment,"- [Voiceover] There you
go, it's up to 45, 45, 50. (screaming) - Push!
- Oh my God! - Push! (screaming) - So, what are we going to be doing today? - Well, today we're gonna
be doing a little bit of electric stim on our
gentleman right here. We're gonna use it to simulate
and mimic labor pains. - Basically since the
Try Guys became a thing, doing the pain simulator has been our number one most requested activity. - So, we're electrocuting ourselves. - I'm actually electrocuting you, but yes. - Childbirth simulator,
which is gonna make my muscles contract, I say muscles, because there's few there. - Do you think we'll die? - I've gotten hurt lots of times, so how painful can this be? - It is the most painful
thing in the world. I don't think there's any
external pain, in my opinion, that could simulate the way labor feels. - The closest we could
get is to get babies, shove them up our asses and poop them out as they electrocute us. - [Voiceover] What world do you live in? - Labor is terrible,
depends on who you are. So, I had a 14 hour labor, but my sister had a two hour labor. - I want that one. - Once we can't handle any more pain, our safe word is epidural. - Childbirth is so painful,
that you would gladly have a needle stuck between the
two vertebrae in your back. - So, where are we gonna be
putting our electrodes today? - Your rectus muscles will
feel tight on your abdomen. - I'm so nervous, and
I'm sure I'm gonna fart. - I'm gonna do four of them, Keith, today. - Okay.
- [Voiceover] What? - Did you bring a razor? - No, you're putting double the amount of little stickies on me. - You're having twins. - This will mimic a lot
because it will actually make the whole abdominal region contract. - In real childbirth,
it's your full torso, it's your stomach, and it's your back, so we're gonna be putting
it on my back as well. - A lot of women tear. - How much actually tears during labor? - It could tear all
the way to your rectum. - Like tear open?
- Yes. - So you just have one big ol' crack? Have you electrocuted
anyone's taint before? - No. - I'm gonna do back, stomach, and... - Okay, show me your taint.
- My phantom vagina. Just to really commit to
what a woman might feel. - You may not know this, but a great many women poop on the delivery table. - Because the act of pushing is very much like having a bowel movement. - What is the likelihood that the muscle contractions force us to poop? - That will depend on where
you put the electrodes. - Yeah, I'd rather have
it near my butt hole... - There.
- Than near my babies. - [Voiceover] Thank you
for going first by the way. - [Voiceover] I hate this. - I'm gonna turn it on just enough for you to get used to the sensations. - Ooh, it stings. That is not the worst pain in the world, but it's not pleasant. - The suspense is killing me. Okay, yeah, there's the tingle. - One, two, three, four, five. - It's just like my
entire belly is vibrating. - I'm not ready for
this, that's the front. Oh, I feel it in the back now. - I think we should do this
guy, just to see what you feel. - (screaming) Okay, okay.
- He's shaking right now. - It's like a million ants and needles just crawling through my skin. - You need to get your body and yourself mentally ready to deal
with all of that pain. - And once active labor
kicks in, then you scream. - [Voiceover] Are you ready? - Do you wanna squeeze my hand? - Oh! - Ah! - Ah! Ah! Ah! - (screaming) - [Voiceover] One, two, three. - Oh my God! (screaming) - Oh, that hurts a lot! That's like somebody just digging their nails into your stomach. - Holy shitballs! - I'm sweating right now. It would be really nice to have my spouse here supporting me. - What a terrible alarm
that it's baby time. What a painful reminder of the next 12 hours of pain you're going to endure. - Contractions at that point
are two to three minutes apart, or even closer, one to two minutes apart, very intense, and I felt
like it was a vise grip inside my belly that would
tighten and then release. - It's getting worse each time. (screaming) - Ow! Ow! (screaming) - Push! (screaming) - Push! (screaming) - Oh, that's an epidural right there. I give up, I would just give up. It's so painful, I can't focus on doing anything when it's happening. - You did great man, you did great. - Did we have it? Or did I just opt out and
we're not having the child? - When you have a vaginal birth, that baby doesn't come out in one push. And you're just laying
there, and I remember it very clearly, laying
there, in the delivery room looking at the ceiling, and thinking, her head is sticking out of my vagina. - We're gonna simulate a longer
contraction now, you ready? - Okay, okay. - We're gonna do some on my
back, where there's not hair. - Here comes a contraction,
contraction, contraction. (screaming) - Oh my God! It's even worse now! Oh, this is the worst! This is the worst, the worst, the worst! (screaming) - Epidural, oh my God! The back is like the most painful (bleep). I can't even explain the feeling. - [Voiceover] My wife had
an emergency C-Section with our first child,
so I'm behind a curtain with my wife, and the
doctors are doing their thing behind the curtain, and they said, wait until we give you
the cue to stand up. I thought I heard the cue,
so I stood up and I looked. And what I saw was my
wife's abdomen cut open and clamped back, and
on a table next to her, they had taken out her intestines and her liver, all that stuff. They were in bowls on the counter. - That's how they do C-Sections. - [Voiceover] Like salad bowls? - They take out the stuff
that's blocking the baby. I sat back down, my wife
said, is everything okay, I just nodded, but I wanted
to say, you're gonna die. - What's the taint feel like? - It feels like it's
simultaneously pulling my ass hole and my balls closer together, and ripping it apart.
- Okay. - It's one of the worst
things I've ever felt. - Why am I waiting for the epidural when I could just wake up
and then there's my baby? - Are you ready?
- No! - Here we go. (screaming) - Epidural, epidural, epidural. This baby is coming
whether I want it or not. (screaming) - Okay! (screaming) Epidural, epidural, epidural. - And then the next push, out she came, and I felt her kick me in the
thighs, and her little arms, and I immediately started crying, because I was like, this is my baby. - I love my mom, I'm
sorry I did this to her. - Your mom is the toughest
person in the universe. I don't care who you are,
your mom is tougher than you. - A lot of it's not fun, but the love you have for your child is indescribable, you love your kid so much. - Your wife would be proud. - I have a small inkling
of how painful this is. Sweetie, I will be there for you. - Now when I see women,
I'm just gonna say, I am so sorry that people ever think that they can tell you what
to do with your body, because you have to deal with your own body already,
and it wants to kill you. - Delivery is tough, it's
very hard, it's painful, but once the baby's out, it's magical. - You still think it's worth it? - I do think it's worth it, it's the greatest thing in the world. - I mean, that's a really
special feeling to know that someone went through all
of that to create you. - I feel like I have to call
my mom, and just thank her. - She already pushed me
out of her and had to raise me for 18 years, I don't
think she wants to hear me.",8:03

views,News,[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you've heard the news donald trump is on fire donald trump fresh off a landslide victory in new hampshire his success has baffled the mainstream media but it turns out the secret to trump has been right under their noses the whole time this is a circus unlike anything that we have seen in modern american politics this is the greatest show on earth is the greatest show on earth now if you want to understand the circus that is donald trump don't ask these idiots ask the guy with a sword down his throat circus performer adam real man people like the danger element of a circus in a sideshow you know when the lion tamer sticks his head in lion's mouth tell me you want to see the lion just chomp his head off yeah the audience i think always wants to know that this stuff is real and it is real we're watching a loaded gun on stage and it could go off at any moment and say mexicans are rapists boom it could say anything so there's a dangerous mexican's a rapist okay so maybe he hasn't been to many trump events but real man taught me that the greatest show must have a ringleader who can work a crowd gotta give him give him a pitch you have to impress them you gotta impress your crowd exactly your poll numbers it's super high correct i'm leading every poll nationwide you're the best that's it the best businessman you've ever seen yes i make great deals look at this show this is the greatest show on earth ladies and gentlemen we are going to hey let's bring out the snake charmer we bring out the snake charmer you bring palin out okay you betcha it has to be something that an audience will want to see everybody had a good old time you bought a hat hell i want to see this freak again exactly this guy got it trump really is the greatest show on earth right adam well you know by calling him the greatest show on earth you're kind of insulting a lot of the circus world okay regardless i had to see trump up close so i headed to one of his rallies and got to hear from some die hard trumpeters i think he's the only candidate in the republican side who's actually going to build a wall and who's going to make him pay for it he's going to make china and you know people say oh you can't make china pay for it you know what that's a bunch of horse crap it's pretty easy to make china pay for it china will be paying for the wall should mexico pay for the wall oh my mexico sorry either way it doesn't matter one of those countries has paid for that one of those countries is paying for that wall donald trump is inaugurated he becomes president united states what's behind that curtain take one of my cards defeation of isis defeation of isis yes what should we do to isis where officially should we bomb isis probably like israel area but not like not necessarily there but around the area i think he's gonna help with the isis what's he gonna do with the isis he can't tell us right now if he tells everybody then the next thing you know somebody else is gonna copy what he says they knew they're trump once i was under the big top we were all grooving to trump's power playlist which included tiny dancer like eight times finally there he was and he wasted no time shining the spotlight on the main event himself takes guts to run for president believe me you've been number one in the polls every single week i've been on the cover of time magazine so much lately when i was on last week i didn't even know they were putting away the cover can you imagine that's when you're really hitting it big he made the audience recoil at the freak show look it back there look at the press turn around and look at these people look at that six they start booing he whipped the crowd into a frenzy with a high wire act of political incorrectness she said he's a [ __ ] and then something strange happened we're gonna do something that's going to be whether you like dwight eisenhower no matter what you do dwight eisenhower i like ike everybody said he started to meander i just asked for tickets i wanted tickets for the debate this is washington d.c right people got bored it's an incredible building but then like any great showman he pulled them back in with his greatest routine a feat of xenophobic strength who the hell is going to pay for the wall what [Applause] classic [ __ ] trump had delivered i laughed i cried i reinvigorated my irrational fear of foreigners i even jockeyed for selfies with a couple of reality tv stars donald great joke great job got it a memory that will last for possibly four years god help us all [Music] [Applause] when was america last great for me i would say the turning point for our country was 1913 when we passed the 17th amendment and what's like back when like women couldn't vote yeah night 12 back up but again like that's kind of your sweet spot right there absolutely but 1913 what year was america great when it was founded except for the slavery stuff except for the slavery stuff you know i think we were probably our strongest immediately post world war ii so around the 1950s mid 40s 50s i mean i think the 50s was great other than uh you know segregation and women's rights we could sit here and paint negative faces of of all times in america correct it's make america great again so when was the last great it's always been great so we're so if it's always been great what are we trying to go back to we're not going back we're going forward well i guess uh the 80s were pretty good right the 80s the 80s great music cocaine crack cocaine yeah well we're always great the people are great so here yep so america is great right now so we did it no we didn't do it america became became great when the founding fathers put pen on paper in 1776 and decided to build a country based on laws that was greatness that was awesome other than the slavery obviously that was terrible and we did have that yeah we did have that and the indian thing right that was terrible and the women's voting thing but other than that that was awesome a few hiccups along the way you know like they say uh you you you nobody made it to the top without breaking a few pieces of china that wasn't an insult by the way [Music] [Applause] donald trump's new ideological screening test will weed out extremists with extreme views about religion such as its oppression of women gays and non-believers that's right trump wants prospective americans to embrace religious freedom gender equality and gay rights at a recent rally in wisconsin his fans were on board i am for extreme vetting i am i think it is a good idea extreme vetting i think that's a good idea of course he forgot one thing just make him eat some bacon these guys were pumped about america's values of tolerance so i knew they'd passed trump's test with flying colors fill in the blank for me two men getting married is blank disgusting actually the answer is legal in the united states it's legal but i don't like it it's important to believe in you know to have respect for everyone's religion so you respect christianity i do judaism yes islam no get a woman be president the presidency is a man's job i have women are qualified to be president no a female has more hormones she could start a war in 10 seconds if she has hot flashes whatever boom haven't all wars been started by men yes do you think a gay couple should have the same rights as a no i don't i really don't i don't think it's fair to the gay couple well no but the regular couple they work so hard you know and the gay couple they want more do you when you say more do you mean equal yeah they want to equal in that and that's just too much yeah no that's the wrong answer sorry hold on turns out trump's ideology test was going to be harder than i thought whenever i hear president i think of man it's a man's job what sort of i may be uh closed-minded no yeah well no um misogynistic no you're voting against your own interests that's it thank you very much these extreme nations they don't treat women with respect we treat women with respect here yes we do that's an american ideal yeah tell me about your shirt what's it say it says hillary sucks but not like monica hilarious so we were talking about treating women with respect it's an american ideal that we treat women with respect you got to give me the back of that shirt one more time that's too much fun trump that [ __ ] we don't even see the irony in it i love it right as passionate as these guys were they just weren't passing trump's ideological test luckily there was still time to study this will just help you prep for the test so if you take it again you'll be more welcome here uh this is a dvd of the third season of will and grace okay it's really likable and not too gay gay people this one is going to be good for you gloria steinem this really like uh humanizes women because that's feminist we have so much work to be done you know you a feminist no obviously extreme vetting was necessary to weed out extremists but until this plan was in place were any of us safe are you afraid the extremists are already here right now they could be anywhere you'll be right here they could be yeah he could be over there maybe that guy or this guy he could be anybody it could be anybody [Music] [Applause] this past summer trump flag waivers spouted a lot of theories about hillary clinton's health we see the coughing fits she's had it seems like a number of blood clots what on earth could be the reason behind hillary clinton's bizarre behavior look it almost seems seizuresque to me turns out they were sort of right we're now learning she's been diagnosed with pneumonia if the crackpots halfway nailed one theory maybe their truth fingers were in deeper than mine i had to find out i headed to trump rallies in the crucial swing states of ohio and wisconsin to discover what his supporters know that the rest of us don't do you think it's worse than pneumonia and where she looks yes what do you think is going on it could be parkinson's it could be ms it could be aids what makes you think she has aids uh way her husband used to be so you think bill had aids yes so how did bill clinton get aids probably messing around with magic johnson that's the natural conclusion yes interesting the clintons and magic johnson what else do they know they're saying there's like a double of her do you think there was a hillary clinton double yeah i think anything's possible when it comes to doubles wow a clinton double who knew so i printed out two identical photos to see if they could see what we couldn't which one's the body double say that one what is it about this one that makes you think it's not hillary clinton that little thing on her cheek is very obvious and and the scarring or whatever this is down in her throat is different they look a ton alike right this looks a little bit younger you think this looks younger yeah but don't you think if you just look at something for long enough and you kind of have a paranoid mind eventually you'll find a difference and make it i think something like that's possible yeah which one are you more attracted to that one yeah uncovering hillary's doubles is one thing but what could they tell us about our current commander-in-chief barack obama is a muslim he's a terrorist nobody will ever tell me differently we don't even know if he's a citizen if you if you don't look at the birth certificate there's almost no evidence there exactly so there's nothing barack obama could do to prove that he was born here if there was maybe witnesses that were attendants at his birth like his mother would you listen to his mother no no she has motivation to lie do you don't trust uh donald trump's birth certificate either uh yeah because he's been here forever how do you know how do you what's your proof um well his parents and no but they they're biased i'm talking about like people who could be in the room they'd be biased well like i'm just using your logic against you okay he acts like a muslim he talks like a muslim he also does the muslim principles as far as jewelry is concerned jewelry yeah jewelry certain months of the year not wearing his wedding ring that's some that's that's a deep cut you want me to connect your necklace to your christianity why would you do that well you just taught me it i didn't even know people were connecting jewelry to religion uh muslims don't wear is that a jew watch and one of the most unbelievable discoveries yet barack obama had big part of 9 11. which part not being around always on vacation never in the office why do you think barack obama wasn't in the oval office on 9 11 dad i don't know would like to get to the bottom of that wow mind blown they also had new truths about the media cover-up of trump's surging popularity i don't think the media really portrays all the african-americans that support donald trump so what should we be portraying where are these african-americans um when you literally look out across the 400 500 people here we don't see any they'll wave wave white people yeah it's like a dave matthews concert except dave matthews actually has african-americans in his band tell me when you see somebody who is not white here right here thank you brother donald trump don't even know how much a loaf of bread or a dozen eggs close so you don't you don't even support donald trump no okay so he didn't work turns out they got one wrong but the rest of their theories can be backed up with ironclad sources and what's your source um just facebook or twitter i mean everything and i you'll look at like facts and you'll put it all together exactly so outside of having no proof what proof do you have i don't have any i don't have any proof opinion your opinion do i have proof no do i have articles no but your mind is made up without any information my mind is made up good enough for me [Music] [Applause] according to the mainstream media donald trump's lewd talk and recent sexual assault allegations are eroding his republican support the gop is abandoning their nominee in droves the exodus of republican support continued republicans are deserting the sinking ship but i don't listen to that noise i listen to this throb this is jordan klepper fingers the pulse [Music] i hitched a ride to a rally in the crucial swing state of pennsylvania to ask trump supporters if he had finally crossed the line you know what so what if he wants a grand [ __ ] i want to grab [ __ ] that's a no i wish i could grab as much [ __ ] as he has well i'd like to grab al qaeda by the [ __ ] and shove some yankee doodle dandy right up its ass also a no but how were they okay with the presidential candidate bragging about sexual assault wait for it i think it's just locker room talk that really what does that mean guys in the bar talk that way when they see a pretty girl what do you guys say i've heard worse about men talking about girls women so are they are you talking about other like presidential candidates like mondale yes it's locker room talk that's what boys do he didn't do it well i don't i don't talk like that well do you have any children i do do they talk like that no they don't they're not those boys well no no you have a husband i do does he talk like that no not that boy no is that how you talk well no but i feel like he says how your dad talks well no but like your pastor talks no not so who talks like that uh well obviously donald trump it was stupid bragging mental men brag we brag right you brag a bit right um not exactly but i know quite a few people that do and background dab yes it was all becoming clear men brag it's just locker room talk grab it while you can trump what what is it the [ __ ] yeah grab it all the way again except i can't talk like that in front of my daughter you just did these things you say people can hear and the locker room was huge extending all the way across the country was there any line trump couldn't cross is there anything trump could say that could come on up that would make you not vote for him no no matter what he says or does i will vote for donald trump if he said the n word would you still vote for him um it wouldn't be right but i would still vote for him what if he said uh everybody should go uh little pigs would that you still vote for him then i would still vote for him yeah wow the media's fingers were nowhere near the pulse they had gotten it wrong people here knew trump's comments weren't sexual assault they were something completely different just ask this man who conducted a highly scientific survey i got news for you i asked a lot of women here and half of them would love to have their [ __ ] snatched by trump i got news for you that is news to me one man's sexual assault is another man's uh flirtation you must be quite the charmer with the ladies i i used to be you know i got the rig now one of them landed me she even squeezes so i can't get it off because she sorted i took it off once and there was a little mark there so she's no dummy oh well i think she's a dummy if she thinks somebody else is gonna do sorry bro just a little bit of locker room talk this has been a divisive nightmare of an election but in the spirit of moving forward at one of the debates the candidates themselves took an opportunity to say one positive thing about each other i hitched a ride to a trump rally to see if his supporters were also ready to rise above the anger and reach out to the other side can you say one nice thing about hillary clinton not really no no not one no no i have absolutely nothing nice to say about hillary clinton what about people who support hillary i think they're idiots no i can't i'm sorry i'd like to be a gentleman and say yeah she got a nice kid but she has a nice kid right i guess she hasn't proven herself to be guilty of anything yet i'm sorry jordan what can i tell you you're bumming me the [ __ ] out man wow that was depressing so i headed to a hillary rally surely her supporters would live up to their slogan of stronger together and teach those hateful trump voters a thing or two about kindness what do you like about donald trump nothing he's an [ __ ] is there any good thing about donald trump that you could say no no no i'll give you time okay let me think um no you didn't really think oh yes all right no you didn't you changed your hair a little bit and then you said the same thing he has economic background okay whether he can put it into a plan that will suit our nation i don't know no stop the first part was a nice compliment you weren't loved enough as a child oh baby be nice be nice so both camps have a ways to go maybe they just needed a little push what if i gave you two dollars would you say something nice about hillary clinton no what if i gave you ten dollars no what if i told you it will help our society to put aside your partisanship and actually say something kind about somebody that half the country supports not hillary no no okay how about this democrats like expressing their feelings maybe that was the way in we're gonna do a i feel statement talk to donald trump okay i want you to say when you blank i feel blank when you say grab her by the [ __ ] i feel like a disrespected woman okay that's good when you say let's build a wall i say let's build you into the wall okay see what you did right there you didn't say i feel what you did is you use that as an opportunity to be negative now that's something you know who would do something like that donald trump don't do this this wasn't working if i couldn't unite the people maybe i could unite their slogans wait no that's not it good okay better that can work make america stronger stronger together again yeah clunky but it it's it's a couple of works make america stronger together again a little bit of both trump way to move forward okay just trying to move my sport make america stronger together again a little bit of both you know what i mean for hillary i don't want big it's for us coming together we'll be together don't worry about that in hell but then just when i gave up hope i finally heard it that one positive thing okay well there's gotta be something good about donald trump let's come over pretend your husband is hillary clinton say something nice i like your hair i mean his hair is hilarious his hair is real nice hair so if there's one thing we can all rally around as a country it's great hair god bless america not even a month since the campaign ended with victory donald trump was getting the ban back together again for something the president-elect planning to visit those states that helped him secure a win for the white house a trump victory tour a victory tour now they tell us they want us to call it a thank you tour they're calling it a victory tour i mean i don't think we've ever seen that before we're calling it a thank you tourist right no one in the media or trump's camp seems to know exactly what this event is so i went to cincinnati to find out what is this uh we know what we got a bunch of people who are really excited about trump they said we're gonna get tired of winning we're not tired he wants to let the people know that things are still going on the stuff that he was still campaigning about he's still going on i mean it's it's it is it's obvious if he doesn't know when the campaign ends that's right what is it again it's victory tools victory tours take another lap right yeah take another lap why not how many of these rallies do you think you'll see in the first 100 days i'm gonna go with 15. it's like the never ending tour never-ending tour we don't have to do any work we can just party all the time all day long all day long somebody's gonna have to run the country yeah well just think tr the trumpster is our president from apprentice to president i love i love trump it's incredible right at least you want to blow your brains out it's so mind-boggling nick jesus was right this was a hell of a bash while trump has changed his tune on things like locking up hillary and draining the swamp these people were partying like it was october 2016. they had their signs and their background dabs and they knew the lyrics to all the hits we're ready we're ready yeah build the wall build a ball join the swamp lock her up we're gonna lock her up of course of course uh now some people are saying she's a good person shouldn't be prosecuting well they're liars well that person is donald trump bray net swamp at least we know donald trump's not gonna stand for having hillary's elitist new york bankers anywhere near the government none of the books except for bringing in some billionaire bankers it's gonna happen it's gonna yeah sure sure so some of them i'm sure the goldman sachs guy i mean that is the swamp we want to drain sure but also make secretary of the treasury oh yeah the swamp will be drained now he does have a couple people like steve mnuchin who wants goldman sachs you got to fill this watch you gotta yeah there's parts of the swamp they're gonna come in there's parts of the swamp they're gonna you know that's just not as catchy to say so yeah it's not yeah don't you want the most qualified person even though it might be a so-called you know swamp member lobbyist or whatnot is that not the best thing to do somebody who's the most qualified for the job has the most experience even if some of their background is suspect that's the person who should have that job that's right a common sense way of looking at things that was i think hillary clinton's entire platform the point is instead of spending time learning how to run the country or following through on campaign promises having a rally like this just feels so good the bottom line is we won we won big i love you too look at this place you're gonna be happy we're all gonna be happy and i was finally starting to see exactly what this was it was a big self-congratulatory pleasure fest in the round this is kind of our triumph and so you guys wanted to like kind of get together in a big circular area and just kind of help each other release some of the tension and celebrate yes yeah exactly it's important for you guys to just all come together at the same time it's a sense of community yeah it's a circle jerk if you all call it that sure yeah it's a circle joke well good talking to you get ready america your forearms are gonna be huge four years ago i hit the streets to get the unfiltered truth from america's most engaged voters trump that [ __ ] we don't even see the irony in it now we're heading into an historic election and i'm excited to get out into america and embed myself in the middle of the campaign trail first stop rain stoked hershey pennsylvania but even mother nature couldn't dampen our spirits it's eight hours before donald trump arrives it's raining and there are people here how's it going good to see you good to see you again you guys excited absolutely baby you're running for congress i bet you are good luck anybody can do it a lot of familiar faces doris carol nice to be out there amongst my people once more how's it going guys here we go again [Music] since my last trump rally there have been roughly 37 marvel movies and one very combative impeachment trial but what else has changed so what's new this season um everything honestly we got this uh baby yoda shirt great america keep well i get it it sounds like something donald trump would say or yoda i suppose they have very similar syntax we're not all great speakers do you have any trump that [ __ ] you don't have trump no anything that's at all aimed at women not for women at women what are you hoping for tonight i'm hoping donald trump is just in a good and we're in a good place of mine right now i hope he talks about immigration so you're hoping for a build a wall i'm hoping for a wall who's going to pay for it who's going to pay for it i say that's what we're going to find out about it's either going to be taxpayer money so maybe that's the chat who's going to pay for it that's what we're going to find out about yeah then why are you here well because two weeks ago i had her dream and in that dream i was given this vision that's you you had a screen printing dream your dream told you that trump is gonna win and then ivanka and then don jr and eric tiffany is going to win in 2048 and then barron great all right all right but baron only serves one turn oh no two terms no that's only one term that's four years yeah actually these are mostly one-term presidents you're not reading it right brother no i'm like 20 no this is 20 24 to 28 that's four years and then another four no no no that's these are one-term presidents ivanka one term don jr one term for ivanka what's sort of what's a date ivanka is 2024 2028 that's eight years that's four years no you have a third year period here where somebody else gets elected it doesn't say anything about re-elected it does it says has her getting elected in 2024 and 2020 your math is wrong no my math is not wrong of course these rallies aren't just about spirited debate it's also an opportunity for trump supporters to clarify their messaging one word descriptor joe biden [ __ ] elizabeth warren elizabeth warren scummy bernie sanders bolshevik pete buddha judge that's just a joke what's the punchline who man trying to be politically correct here but you know so when i said butterjudge i thought the word you were going to pick was vet okay pete beauty judge peat butt pete butt yeah that's two words and i can't say the whole thing on camera what's the whole thing oh it's homophobic that's why you can't stand homophobia aside there was one big new thing hanging over this rally the impeachment what do you think about this impeachment [ __ ] [ __ ] why is it [ __ ] why because it didn't do anything it's [ __ ] it's [ __ ] it's total [ __ ] it's total nonsense and trump has been grooming his supporters to push back on any impeachment talk with this simple demand all you have to do is read the transcript read the transcript read the transcript it's all about the transcript read the transcript right transcript i have not read it but we should read the transcript we should look at the transcript right yeah look at the transcript have you read the transcript uh i i trust the word of our president yeah read the transcript right yeah yeah abso absolutely did you read the transcript i've i've i mean i've written most of it but there's there's nothing give them the transcript yeah i don't have time for you know reading all the you know impeachment all that [ __ ] you know but uh how long have you been waiting out here for donald trump since 8 o'clock hours a lot of free time absolutely read the transcript read the transcript yeah did you read the transcript i don't have to everyone else has i can read it if i need to but right yeah but it's important that everybody reads the transcript it is very important pay attention and think for yourself yes you have but to be clear you have not read the translation i haven't no right but it is just important yeah yeah don't be a sheep think for yourself but again just to be very clear you have not read i have not read it you just trusted somebody else yeah what were you saying about don't be a sheep don't see think for yourself do your own research right don't be a sheep it was a message these people who were being herded through gates and corralled into pens to then be guarded over by men on horses knew all too well these totally not sheep are ready for 11 more months of this whatever this is and so am i campaign 2020 here we go again [Music] [Applause] last week i went to tropical iowa again and while all eyes there have been on the democratic candidates a certain recently impeached former reality tv star showed up in town to get his own cup of iowa nice trump train choo-choo truck train choo-choo it's just awesome yeah oh [ __ ] i've had nightmares with that shirt been to a trump rally before no sir what are your expectations truth truth at a trump rally yeah good luck however all anyone's been talking about is the impeachment and while 69 percent of americans wanted to hear from witnesses like john bolton senate republicans wouldn't allow it so what did these folks think of the trial as it nears its end i think the impeachment trial itself is a joke period it's a [ __ ] show we think it's a complete sham he hasn't done anything wrong how did we get here with no evidence he didn't do anything he didn't do anything they were well said well that's it right he didn't do anything he didn't do anything so we should let everybody testify correct oh oh yeah no no no do you think john bolton should testify no why not well he could testify but i think he's uh vengeful for getting fired from his job i think he's a liar john bolton's a liar absolutely there should be a system set up where he takes an oath and then under oath he tells the truth otherwise he's punished i think there should be yes and maybe there's a judge who's put in charge like the highest judge in the land right appointed by a republican and then we can all see what he has to say would you be for a system like that sure while they seem to want first hand information from witnesses they definitely didn't want witnesses with first-hand information regardless they're sticking to trump's favorite old defense i've read the transcript for verbatim not verbatim but i've read the transcript meaning like i've watched everybody read it on the news i haven't seen the transition you know that's not what reading the transcript means but you've watched people read this right i haven't personally read the transcript have you read the transcript no [Laughter] i have spoiler alert he asks a foreign country to interfere in our election it's crazy right you know what i've explored this one before but luckily trump has two or five new airtight legal defenses there's no whatever that word is quid pro crow my lips are called it's it's hard to say right it's even harder to convince other people that it happened new word i just learned yeah there's no crime that's been um there's no crime they've been accused of what does that mean what what do you mean they've not make an accusation or brought an actual penal code yeah you can tell he hasn't done anything wrong just by his demeanor i mean he would be trying to hide things if he were blocking witnesses or evidence or something like that you'd be like oh you're hiding something but otherwise right he's saying let him let him see everything let him see i'll prove whatever you want want me to prove right but trump is blocking witnesses i don't care oh but we were saying earlier that if you're blocking something it shows that you have something to hide didn't obama hide his birth certificate he did and trump found that thing and it said he was an american citizen yeah i know so so who's got egg on their face yeah no who has egg on their face well so what do these supporters see in our impeached president's future they're gonna teach him again is it gonna be another one i i probably all the way to for five more years did you feel the impeachment was a distraction not at all i don't think he's got a skin that is is about as thick as it gets donald trump is yeah thick skin he sticks kid he gets mad if a celebrity makes fun of him on twitter well the uh um it's good i i like his tweetings he should take a victory lap it should have already happened yeah yeah what should he do ellen dershowitz got oj off oj wrote a book dershowitz gets trump off trump reads a book i mean he can do whatever he wants let's say it happens tomorrow trump beats impeachment trump can get on to running the country exactly like he like he has been doing for the past three and a half years now i mean and now with like no impediments no checks no balances exactly they need to have like more restrictions on who can just come up with articles for impeachment when nothing's been done it wasn't donald trump's way of going forward the only people that would be in his way are other republicans trying to get in office yeah he's finally he's evolved this presidency into a dictatorship that we could all understand exactly yeah wow do these folks care at all about our president declaring himself absolute ruler i think i might know the answer i don't care exactly in the era of covid social gatherings come with a certain amount of risk but trump supporters have found safer footing on water so i charted a boat and went to new jersey baby the site of a trump rally on boats while the president himself isn't there he shouted out to his beautiful boaters and it's the perfect way for me to get back out into the field to get my sea legs under me i had to talk to a real deal maga yachtsman like captain john of tom's river safe social distancing practices meant staging an interview that was not awkward at all we're going to the donald trump parade today and riley we expect over a thousand boats i gotta say i'm getting a little bit of boat envy here well boat envy peanut santa you you know i was making that connection too yeah enough land talk i wanted to see just how impressive these beautiful boaters were it is a line of trump votes as far as the eye can see it really just keeps going it's like an election polling place in a minority district who are you voting for who who are you i can't who are you voting for must be undecided i'm usually not so worried out on the water but technically this is an entire armada of jersey drivers hey thank you you too little history about the area we're here in the jersey shore that's the cove where snooki got finger and over there is the beach that chris christie hogged to himself make america great again this is a weird slogan for an incumbent i'm worried about govind voters absolutely love him and the president loves boating but why well because a lot of beautiful women come with the deal number one and he's always been loves women you know that was obvious when i first met him and you know as another man i could tell you could tell he was way looking at a woman and you know what another disrupting him with your eyes oh yeah that's the kind of guy he went in charge i was on his motor yacht down in uh atlantic city and he had a threw a party on it and i was um i was a guest on board you were a guest on board it was great uh uh don johnson was there robin leach i mean it was really a who's who you know now what trump wife was allowed to be on the boat what trump mistress and future wife was on the wall well i met both of his wives in in past years and everything the first one and the second one but i remember the first time i met him his his aura came in the room before he did if you had to rank trump's energy from a scale of zero to 130 000 what would you rake it at the top of the you know top of the spectrum 130 000 yeah close to it 40 000 these numbers keep going up yeah i know but uh he's he's that powerful i mean he's getting bombarded from all sides he needs to stand there he's not flinching yeah yeah he's almost it's almost like he's doing nothing well in many ways you're correct do you support the basic tenets of the black lives matter movement [Music] oh okay you understand that systemic racism is something that we all together have to collectively work together to dismantle i don't know if they're understanding i'm gonna try something more their speed what's your favorite bon jovi song [Music] i wonder what the relationship is between number of flags and midlife sexual insecurities one to one if you can't beat them join them so i used maritime signal flags to speak the beautiful language of the truntilla as the day wound down it was clear the event was a success of course the threshold was pretty low i don't think we saw one fire and one thing broke yeah or one minority to be fair well not true if you look closely you'll see everybody here you'll see everybody that brought in here it's very diverse i see yachts i see skiffs i see jet skis sure the rest of the country is suffering through a historic pandemic and a major economic and racial reckoning but out here for the bear-chested admirals the jet ski superheroes and the froze pirates there's still only one man suited to be president he doesn't speak or you know like a normal you know politician but he talks like a billionaire and a businessman out of new york yeah i know a lot of people i mean because i'm a businessman i have lots of friends that are very successful business people and he um you know he's really perfect for the job right now do you think you're speaking from a position of privilege no not so much as a privilege but uh just my instinct uh again to be clear your position is on the front of a 50 foot long yacht 70 70. yes but you're a common man i am you might think hours in the hot sun bouncing on choppy seas listening to choppy arguments might take its toll on a liberal land lover like myself and you'd be right on the day donald trump most likely contracted covet at an event in the rose garden he hosted another slightly different kind of super spreader event a campaign rally these rallies are a known vector for spreading many of trump's favorite lies so i traveled to the battleground state of pennsylvania to see just how many people had caught trump's version of reality i'm here at a trump rally in harrisburg pennsylvania we are weeks away from the election months away from finding out who wins and probably about a year away from losing a loved one to the inevitable civil war let's do this yeah make america great again [Music] rambo flag classic how's it going you mind if i check out some of your stuff yesterday we did fifty four hundred dollars in sales what is selling now is there anything two hundred thousand deaths later that doesn't quite work as well not with the trump stuff it's almost as if uh the trump stuff isn't affected by that at all exactly yeah tell me about these shorts well we got the donald trump shorts you know we got a rep president today you got to be careful donald trump that close to your genitals in a decade he's going to deny he was ever there and countersued pretty funny when did you get out here to see donald trump uh about 26 hours ago 10 o'clock yesterday morning so you're gonna wait two days to see the president first of all come on donald trump is our first rock star superhero president he's the real life tony stark they should call him president iron man well tony stark gave a [ __ ] about science [Laughter] so much excitement in the air so many droplets you feel like people are going to feel this effect for weeks to come why no mask frankly i forgot it in my car i forgot to grab it on the way out honestly it's not even for coven i just think all of the sharpie fumes are not super healthy for you probably not when it was still wet what do you think about uh the whole mask situation right now are you worried about covid um for me like me personally i'm not worried but my dad is like underlying health conditions okay so if if he gets it he's gonna be in trouble why come here and take that risk if your dad has health issues just to see trump so it's it's worth a little bit of risk yeah [Music] nice flags man i love them wear a mask back at it i don't live on the dictators the efficacy of trump's herd mentality theory was on full display that's america right there that's freedom that's freedom that's freedom are you excited about the scope of course i am what are you excited about uh it's gonna fill the court with constitutional loving americans again that court has been too liberal for too long really of course it has you're pro-life of course it's important for americans to do whatever they can to protect a human life yes why aren't you wearing a mask i mean again it's a personal choice i think if everybody was wearing them and everybody said put a mask on i respect everybody's wishes and put it on we're not cheap we're not sheep you're not cheap but if everybody here was wearing masks if everybody was wearing it but again we're not cheaper you're not cheap we're not so you're going to look at what everybody's doing and you're going to follow that's it yeah but not people not cheap as the not sheep were bravely running into a tightly packed airplane hangar to see patient zero i couldn't help but think of d-day and the beaches of normandy well i don't know which side they're on as i traced the spread of [ __ ] i was fearful for those most vulnerable whose defenses were already compromised about two months before covet started i somebody put me on to q anon i believe some of it and i don't believe some of it but i believe only so much can be a conspiracy i think a lot of it's true you know about cunanan is there anything you can tell us that i don't know jfk junior is still alive what this guy is always behind trump at the rallies so you're saying jfk jr is still alive and spending his time in the background at trump rally from q a yes do you think racism exists in america i do not believe that people hate each other as much as you don't think racism is a problem in america i do not think it's a problem now there's a potential that jfk junior is alive and here at a trump rally baby hilarious but with just over a month until the voters go to the polls had the president somehow already contaminated election day if biden is elected uh-huh you trust the results no no they're cheaters but if trump wins do you trust the results yes absolutely i think mailing ballots is not going to be fair because it leads to fraud and stuff you don't you don't trust mail in battle not at all the president uses mail-in ballots yeah for they're going to use mail-in ballots for this upcoming election right right but the president himself uses mail-in ballots oh he does where he that's how he votes he mails it in that's different that's yeah that's different i was a different i don't i don't know i honestly didn't know that i only know what you're talking but you do know it's different after hours in the heavily contaminated parking lot i wanted to self quarantine and chill but i still had one burning question are you in a better place than you were four years ago absolutely absolutely is america a better place than they were i believe absolutely we have higher unemployment we have 200 000 people dead due to covet and we have riots in the streets let me just tell you this much yes i'm doing much better i'm literally making four times as much as i was making when obama was president what do you do i work for a debt relief company yeah so now as a debt relief employee you make more money under donald trump yeah i do yeah it's good to be a white debt relief collector [Applause] [Music] after an historic 227 year campaign i found myself at another trump rally one of three he was having in pennsylvania that very day and while there was still some of the usual totally realistic expectations i'm calling 47 states for trump at this rally in the final week of election season i noticed something different it was quiet are people just tired you know i think people i think people are exhausted me too and i'm ready to move on i've been doing a lot of trump rallies before and i i have to say this is probably the most subdued rally i've been to it's eerily quiet you can hear a q anon push notification ding in someone's pocket this was a chance to hear trump make his final case and frankly for maga country to do the same it's about the economy he provided jobs and when people are working and not out looting and burning cities historically this presidency has lost more jobs than any other that's not true it's not true he has that he has not have you like tony i need my sheet i'm going to give you facts come on give me facts what's on the back sheet i'm going to show you the fact sheet is that in my car we have not had a fact sheet before this is oh really bring it bring it i'm bringing it i hope it doesn't have a list of all the dead because that thing's going to be huge okay jobs added 4 million under biden and obama negative two points what is the website you're on i don't know you don't know i'll have to google it okay so her friend didn't have the facts but she did have the zinfandel let's talk about african-american communities and all the things we've done for that great what has he done with the uh what's your fee you know where he was corrected the uh you got to help me out here tony come here while i waited for tony to get her [ __ ] together i wanted to wrap my head around their hail mary october surprise and that's hunter biden and his well i'll just let them explain it you can see on you know fox and one american news about the uh the laptop the hunter biden's laptop and then all the corrupts and taking money from the different countries you know from russia and china and joe biden would do whatever these countries needed what did he do oh he would either what he did or did not do what didn't what did he do you have to be determined exactly what he did i saw pedophilia in china something like that do you believe it i don't know that's something i have to look into a lot more we see about like the the hunter biting scandal what exactly happened with that i think they found a laptop that had you know emails um it was an fbi they found a laptop with like emails and pictures of you know biden talking with like ukraine and china about business deals and stuff like that which biden uh hunter biden did something happen they want to push it to get it you know get the investigation underway before the election yeah but what's the investigation on about just the laptop and just did what was on it what was on the laptop i mean could the conspiracy theorists would say that it's joe biden and hunter biden communicating with you know outside countries on business deals and stuff like that are you calling him a conspiracy theorist that's just what he said right the conspiracy because only because it hasn't been proven yeah make a ton of money and do absolutely nothing except say hey you can meet my dad that's a disgusting trait right to just use your father's name to make money off of that absolutely nepotism needs to be looked into big time yes what do you think about ivanka oh she's so gracious i see ivanka as someone who is following or creating and enhancing people's lives around jobs and training and whatever causes she has just like lady diana had 20 years ago she had certain causes aids and different things like that that she was involved with lady diana seeking copyrights in china while she had a position of power i don't know what you're talking about as the horn rang and the masses filed into the last rally there was a bittersweet feeling in the air folks are heading on in this is the last chance for them to get unfettered access to the president united states after after this it might be through plexiglass maybe with a telephone if this somber attitude was a reflection of what could happen on election day are these folks prepared for a world post-trump trump could totally win if for some chance he doesn't win what happens to all of this afterwards me personally sure i will not live under a socialist government and just look up the three red flags on the biden campaign poster there's three red lines yeah look it up on google well i think it's an e it's supposed to be an e but look at the three red flags or three red banners and they mean communism he snuck communism right there on the flag you got it really you don't want to be in a place of socialized medicine nope so where would you go i'm going to look at costa rica costa rica which has universal health care yeah i mean i'm just i'm not going to live under socialist rule i don't think biden's going to make the four years and the camelback forget it the camelbak who's that kamala oh wow that both mispronounced the name and uh xenophobic yeah absolutely wow that's a twofer if they don't take you in costa rica i'm sure argentina would welcome you and your point of view with open arms so the pitches have been made and the escape routes planned nothing left to do other than vote your asses off and hope we get the results soon until then i'll be hiding out right here good luck america [Music] [Applause] trump's people were gathering so i went to washington dc to the self-proclaimed and self-counted million maga march where moms for trump manga dads and free jazz instrumentalists for trump converged to do what exactly we are here to celebrate the winning of donald trump oh you're four years too late huh you're four years too late what no no he won this time this time you won not the size of the flag that matters it's how many votes you get electoral college system they were here to celebrate the fact that america is a rich diverse nation with so many different kinds of alleged election fraud there's people there's people that's that's changing votes who people across across the united states where did you hear this all over we can't ignore it we're talking about having dead people vote number one should trump have appealed more to the dead person vote should he appeal we just need fairness to me the biggest fraud is unfortunately the millions of voters that voted for biden that were brainwashed by the media everybody said that they're standing on your flag it's a big flag it's also not an american flag star is a stripe signer brother just appreciate it if you don't see that it feels like it's mostly donald trump obscuring still i appreciate if you don't stand up be honest if anybody's disrespecting a flag i think it's the 10-foot high donald trump i have an analogy in the nfl there's a close play what do they do they really review it right and sometimes it takes them 15 minutes there's delays the game they got to look at every little technicality let me do one i got an analogy it's like the nfl there's a game okay it's the lions versus the packers the lions lose everybody goes home but the lions stay on the field and they say we didn't lose and everybody's like well if you look at the scoreboard it's like uh-uh he didn't lose who didn't lose trump but he had less votes oh yeah yeah but you gotta take california out of the equation and he wins the nashville if you definitely discount certain people then the numbers add up in your favor okay for what you want to stop the steal bro stole it stole it blatantly what what's what's the evidence the the the mail-in ballots first of all we all know the whole corona was to send the mail-in ballots out to steal the election along with the uh the voting machines are all compromised so anyway the corona was created to create the democrats are working with the communist chinese to put biden in because uh because china has blackmail on joe biden that is a fact you have that on any t-shirt no people are stealing our it's elections this is our country people are stealing our elections how are they stealing the election because they're putting voter fraud it's suspicious how are they putting voter fraud department of homeland security said was the most secure election in america who's that that's one guy like you and me broseph that's donald that's donald trump's department of homeland security and so because one person says something that's definitely means what it is that's the government and the court trump trump's lawyer said there's no fraud don't try and twist the baby i've been in politics for a long time don't try and twist me baby you're in politics i am the regional tea party chairman baby you're the tea party i'm the tea party baby i'm the regional tea party chairman in the frenchburg region come on fake news what you got go find yourself a safe space we are patriots let me get this straight you're yelling at me to find a safe space and you have elevated yourself with a megaphone and you have a shield they were having trouble facing the reality at hand though there were occasional signs of progress something fitting about a u-haul truck here yet no one seems to acknowledge that trump's legal defense is crumbling it doesn't matter though for these guys some battles never end what is that is that is that trump that's trump on a confederate plane that's confederate flag yeah see that cnn who will say buddy you don't know how to pick a winner you might as well put a jets hat on if they don't trust this election's narrative which the rest of the world is seeing what do they trust i trust trump and what he says and what he knows you know i don't trust the media that much so the only person you really believe is donald trump himself uh that's not the only person i believe who else do you believe i mean ultimately i believe jesus is king and i believe the bible that's like two you got jesus and trump no i trust a lot of people my friends my family tucker carlson tucker carlson jesus and donald trump and more i can go on and on if you want no i think i get the picture we used to like fox we don't like fox we don't like msnbc we don't like cbs we don't like any of the fake news channels because they lie all the time what happened to fox was it their coveted covers that turned you off no what about hannah i like hannity tucker tucker and taco yeah so just two hours every day of fox news otherwise it's a complete boycott yes absolutely even fox wasn't welcome at this magapalooza which was feeling less like the peace and love of woodstock and more like the buzzkill at altima the end of an era complete with actual knife violence are you guys the liberal media i have one word for you you are controlled by the deep state that's like four or five six words ten words that's even two that one's even two questions and i have one more for you two words that's two that's two words can no one in the manga world count [Applause] [Music] you,59:23
-ybiXR2WCFQ,SEA,Science,Journey to the Andromeda Galaxy [4K],1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ybiXR2WCFQ,4 weeks ago,1.5M views,Science,the universe is teeming with galaxies many bigger brighter and more densely packed with stars than the milky way but most are so inconceivably far away that they are much too faint to be seen with the naked eye however there is one galaxy which appears visible in the night sky a galaxy that has revealed to us as much about the universe as it has about itself that galaxy is the andromeda galaxy a vast ancient colony of stars more than twice the size of the milky way today we will be taking a journey from this galaxy's ancient history right up to its remote future using the most beautiful images and intricate data to know our cosmic neighbour like never before this is our journey to the andromeda galaxy the andromeda galaxy is known by many names this one owes to the constellation in which it can be found named after the phoenician princess andromeda wife of perseus in greek mythology it is also known as ngc 224 and messier 31 according to the various star catalogues it has appeared in unlike most galaxies andromeda is visible to the naked eye best seen in dark moonless skies during autumn and winter nights in the northern hemisphere as such it was discovered long before we knew that other galaxies existed but it was incorrectly assumed to be a nebula residing within the bounds of the milky way for the longest time the earliest known mention of the galaxy came in the year 964 a.d in persian philosopher abd al-rahman al-sufi's book of fick's stars which recorded it as a nebulous smear but it wasn't studied in any greater detail until the invention of the telescope in the early 1600s when it was rediscovered by simon marius later in 1764 the object was added as the 31st entry in charles messier's catalogue of deep sky fuzzy objects which included a number of other galaxies unbeknown to messier himself later that century william herschel noticed that the center of m31 appeared to have a red tinge when compared with the exterior and because he was able to observe such fine detail he incorrectly assumed andromeda to be the nearest of all the great nebulae postulating a distance of no more than 18 000 light years in 1845 william parsons was the first to identify a spiral structure in the galaxy's m51 and m99 and five years later he added andromeda along with these galaxies and a number of others to a new classification of so-called spiral nebulae believing them to be their own type of gaseous cloud within the milky way not everybody was convinced by the nebula explanation a few well-respected minds of the time starting with 18th century philosopher emmanuel kant suggested that this object may in fact be its own island universe a vast congregation of stars like the milky way but situated much further beyond than any other object back then however the milky way was thought to comprise the entirety of the universe and this idea placed m31's distance on a scale much too vast for contemporary astronomers to accept that was until 1917 when american astronomer heber curtis witnessed a nova event coming from inside m31 where a transient luminous object briefly outshone its surroundings after scouring the limited collection of historical photographs of the object curtis found no fewer than 11 other nova events occurring inside andromeda considerably more than anywhere else in the milky way but all appearing to be around 10 magnitudes fainter than those observed elsewhere in the sky it was at this moment that curtis realised what he was looking at not a nebula but a much more distant and remote colony of stars like the milky way this led curtis to revive emmanuel kant's island universe hypothesis proposing andromeda to be some half a million light years away but this claim was disputed by many scientists most notably by fellow american astronomer harlow shapley who had previously measured the milky way and thus what he considered to be the entire universe to be around 300 000 light years in diameter this culminated in one of the most significant events in 20th century science the great debate of 1920 where shapley and curtis discussed the nature of the universe and of the spiral nebulae in front of a live audience at the smithsonian museum of natural history shapley on the one hand argued that the milky way was the entire universe and that all known spiral objects were merely their own type of nebula residing within he argued that if they truly were other galaxies their distance would have to be in the order of tens of millions of light years a jumping scale not many contemporary astronomers were willing to accept curtis on the other hand highlighted the over density of novae with an andromeda when compared with the rest of the milky way he argued that no type of nebula could explain the high number yet consistent dimness of these events he also pointed out dark lanes within early photographs of andromeda's spirals noting their similarities to the opaque dust clouds lying within the milky way's zone of avoidance but the debate ultimately yielded no clear winner and it took another four years for the question to finally be put to bed in 1924 edwin hubble settled the debate by using the hooker telescope in california to measure pulsating cepheid variable stars within andromeda a variable star's pulsation period is indicative of its luminosity and once we know a star's luminosity we can compare that to its apparent brightness from earth to constrain a distance using this technique hubble indisputably demonstrated that m31 was more than a million light years away and thus had to be its own galaxy furthermore all the so-called spiral nebulae that had been discovered were their own galaxies as well each lying tens of millions of light years beyond our local group the true terrifying scale of the universe had been revealed a universe filled with thousands or perhaps even millions of galaxies a scale far beyond anything thought possible before [Music] once we had realized that m31 was a separate galaxy our understanding of the universe took a great leap forward thanks to its proximity andromeda offers an unparalleled opportunity to study a spiral galaxy like the milky way from the outside looking in by the 1950s we were making radio maps of the galaxy and today all four of nasa's great space observatories regularly survey andromeda for ultraviolet infrared and x-ray signals and while there hasn't been a dedicated spacecraft or mission to study our neighbour there have been a number of telescopes launched to survey more distant galaxies and for telescopes like hubble which regularly stares at galaxies billions of light years into the void a galaxy under 3 million light years away is a simple task and thus we have a wide range of beautifully detailed and jaw-dropping images of andromeda we have made mosaics of its stars and maps of its interior we've found clusters clouds neutron stars and black holes within its bounds its interior contents mirrors that of our own galaxy but often on a larger scale and so without further ado let us dive into these findings as we set out on the road to andromeda andromeda is a barred spiral galaxy like the milky way consisting of an outlying spiral structure of dust and gas connected by a dense bar-shaped concentration of stars in the galactic core our neighbour's structural similarities to our own galaxy suggest that the two followed similar evolutionary paths andromeda is thought to have formed around 10 billion years ago and has been growing by crashing into and consuming other galaxies ever since m31's torrid past is evidenced by its vastly elongated structure the visible component of the galaxy is thought to be around 120 000 light years in diameter not too dissimilar to the milky way however andromeda's full structure includes an extended disk of scattered stars flung outwards by tidal interactions giving the galaxy a maximum extension of some 220 000 light years by far the largest object in the local group its stellar population greatly outnumbers even the most generous estimates for the milky ways with m31 thought to be home to more than a trillion stars the galaxy's distance from earth has been constrained via a number of different methods with most measurements agreeing on a value of about 2.56 million light years the first step in this enormous expansive journey comes when we rise above the plane of the milky way as less of its starlight extinguishes our view of the galaxies beyond the local group the true mind-blowing scale of this enormous universe becomes apparent once we have passed beyond the milky way's outlying stars and its ghostly satellite galaxies we reach intergalactic space just about as empty as you can get in a universe dominated by gravity for comparison the air we breathe on earth contains approximately 10 trillion trillion atoms per cubic meter even just above the atmosphere in space there are still a million trillion atoms per cubic meter interstellar space between stars only contains around a thousand atoms per cubic meter but in intergalactic space that count drops to just 10 atoms per cubic meter but with that said there's not nothing out there the great galactic highway also contains the most ill-fated stars and planetary systems which have been ejected from their galaxy entirely by the enormous tidal forces of collisions the conditions on such worlds are just about as cold and as lonely as you can get in space with no heat source of any kind out here intergalactic rogue planets freeze solid from their atmospheres right down to their cores only halfway into our cosmic journey do we begin to stray into andromeda's territory not yet into its starry fields but instead into its enormous galactic atmosphere like the milky way surrounding andromeda is a diffuse halo of plasma thought to have been expelled with tremendous force by reverberations from andromeda's past collisions this gives the halo a truly staggering radius of 1.3 million light years extending more than half the distance between m31 and us inside this atmosphere we find andromeda's satellite galaxies each hiding clues about its violent past andromeda currently hosts more than 20 known satellite galaxies and probably had more in its past which it has since devoured of these satellite galaxies there are three in particular which are thought to have played a key role in forming andromeda's skewed elongated structure and its enormous galactic halo they are messier 32 messier 110 and messier 33 aka the triangulum galaxy m32 is a small dwarf elliptical galaxy seen as a little fuzzy blob of golden light in close-up photographs of andromeda the satellite is only around 6500 light years in diameter yet it is held together by a supermassive black hole more than a million times the mass of the sun that is an extremely massive nucleus for such a small galaxy which suggests that it may have been larger in the past given the mass of the central black hole scientists think that m32 may have once been its own spiral or lenticular galaxy even larger than the triangulum galaxy but ultimately not large enough to survive its encounter with its host as the two galaxies came within touching distance of one another the ill-fated proto-galaxy had its outlying stars absorbed by andromeda leaving only the dense galactic core bound to the supermassive black hole now it appears as a small golden elliptical galaxy with an ageing stellar population m110 is another elliptical satellite galaxy of andromeda larger than m32 at around 17 000 light years in diameter much like the former m110 is thought to have interacted with andromeda in the past scientists have detected faint dusty metal-rich lanes within andromeda's halo thought to be made up of stars stripped from the satellite galaxy as it came within reach of andromeda imagine what it would be like to live inside m110 you would see andromeda's vast side on galactic disk consume your sky at night just think of the historical societal and religious implications if early humans had seen something like this hanging in their ancient sky finally there's messier 33 aka the triangulum galaxy it is the current third largest member of the local group a dwarf spiral galaxy around 60 000 light years in diameter it is not known whether m33 is a true satellite of andromeda it may just be its own galaxy which happens to be situated around 750 000 light years beyond but in any case the two galaxies have definitely interacted within the last few billion years and the data points to them interacting again in the future with the 40 billion stars of the triangulum galaxy destined either to be absorbed into a new galaxy or to be banished out of the local group entirely finally after millions of light years on this dark lonely voyage we arrive at the andromeda galaxy's outer edge once we've passed through the plasma halo we reach the denser extended stellar disk made up of stars scattered by andromeda's past collisions once we're through all of that we finally reach the visible component of the galaxy the barred spiral structure rich in dust gas and metals similar to the milky way but unlike the milky way andromeda's spiral structure is more complicated having been deformed by billions of years of gravitational interactions with the likes of the triangulum galaxy among others in 1998 the esa's infrared telescope suggested that andromeda may be transitioning into a ring galaxy as the dust in its body appears to be grouped into overlapping rings at various distances from the core studies in the years since using nasa's spitzer telescope have shown two spiral arms which extend away from the central bar and beyond the rings but they are fractured into seven spiral segments separated by junctions of enhanced hydrogen gas where vigorous star formation is occurring ngc 206 is one such region andromeda's largest star-forming cloud situated at a boundary between two of its southwest spiral arms at around 4000 light years in diameter it is one of the largest clouds of its kind in the entire local group and contains a cluster of more than 300 luminous blue supergiant stars with diameters dozens of times that of the sun and ngc 206 is not the only place where we find clusters in andromeda in fact we've identified more than 460 globular clusters within its bounds more than treble the number discovered in our own galaxy the most significant of these clusters is male 2 it is andromeda's most massive known cluster containing several million luminous stars of varying ages and metallicities the mass luminosity and overall disparity in its stellar population implies that male 2 may not be a true globular cluster and may actually be the disrupted heart of a proto-galaxy in a manner similar to m32 but on a smaller scale the outer layers of male 2 were stripped away and dissolved into the fields of andromeda but its galactic core managed to remain bound by its central intermediate mass black hole of 20 000 solar masses and so now these surviving stars cling to the black hole as its barrels around the galaxy appearing as a surrogate globular cluster which hides the secrets of a richer past andromeda's stellar population seems broadly in line with the milky ways containing olden young stars clusters nebulae black holes and perhaps life-supporting worlds around stars like the sun unfortunately m31 is much too distant for us to be able to hone in on the planetary systems of its stars we can't even do that within our own galaxy however despite the odds in 1999 scientists thought that they had detected indirect evidence for a planet within andromeda when a microlensing event was detected microlensing occurs when the light of a luminous source is bent very slightly as it travels towards earth by the gravity of a planetary mass object one possible explanation for this andromeda based microlensing signal dubbed pa99n2 was that the light of a red giant star was being warped by a surrounding exoplanet with a mass six times that of jupiter unfortunately however microlensing events often occur due to unpredictable chance alignments and so it's unlikely that we'll ever be able to catch this same signal again to follow up on it but even if not the result of an exoplanet we can still say with relative certainty that andromeda like the milky way is home to billions of planets orbiting its stars many of which will be sun-like and suitable for supporting earth-like worlds in addition to live stars we've also found dead ones within andromeda our search for x-ray sources within our neighbor has led to the discovery of dozens of black hole candidates and possibly even neutron stars too m31 is likely to be crawling with these deceased stellar cores left behind by his older generations of stars but the most significant black hole is of course the one that lies at the center of the galaxy in the place where we find one of andromeda's most peculiar features its dense galactic core is split into two regions classed as a double nucleus with the two nuclei dubbed p1 and p2 p1 is the more luminous concentration of mata but it is offset from the center thought to be a blanket of bright stars orbiting the inner nucleus in contrast the less luminous concentration p2 does lie at the center and contains andromeda's supermassive black hole which powers its galactic tide the black hole is estimated to be more than a hundred million times the mass of the sun significantly more massive than the milky way's central supermassive black hole sagittarius a star which is only around 4 million solar masses the reason for this disparity like so many of andromeda's other features is likely the product of its past collisions as andromeda has swallowed other galaxies these mergers have supplemented its central black hole with abundances of gas and matter thus m31's black hole has consumed much more mass than sagittarius a star over the course of his life culminating in this overwhelmingly large beast housed by the fractured compound galactic core the journey to andromeda is long and at present untraversable for us humans even if we were able to escape the milky way's gravity the time required to travel even one light year would vastly exceed the span of one lifetime however though we may not be able to get to andromeda we may not need to after all as within a few billion years andromeda will come to us when studying images of the galaxy one striking aspect of andromeda is its bluish tinge but this is not the result of the natural color of the galaxy's starlight it is in fact being caused by a phenomenon known as blueshift one of two types of doppler shift doppler shift occurs when waves traveling towards an observer are warped by the motion of the object emitting them think ambulances and police car sirens they sound different when approaching us to when they are moving away this is because the oncoming sound waves are bunched up while the ones trailing are stretched out the same phenomenon applies to light traveling through space if an object is moving away from us its light will be shifted towards the red end of the spectrum and the galaxy will become red-shifted most galaxies in space are red-shifted because the expansion of the universe is pushing them away over time but by the same token an object moving through space towards us will have its light waves compressed causing them to appear blue what this means is that andromeda's aesthetic blue tint is indicative that it is heading right for us at speeds of around 110 kilometers per second the reason well whilst the expansion of the universe separates most galaxies andromeda and the rest of the local group are all close enough to us to be attracted to the milky way's gravity thus over the next several billion years the contents of the local group will coalesce into a single object starting with the head-on collision of the milky way and andromeda in the next two billion years andromeda will grow subtly in the night sky creeping up in size until it becomes larger and brighter than the moon and every other night sky object within 3 billion years it will occupy a considerable portion of our field of view its light and gas extinguishing the view of the universe behind of course barring some sort of miraculous engineering the earth will have long been rendered uninhabitable by the evolution of the sun but should anything further out in the solar system manage to survive this far into the future they will see their sky tarnished and illuminated by a messy asymmetric galaxy collision in four billion years the two galaxies will have crashed into each other fundamentally deforming their spiral structures and scattering their gases after the initial impact the cause of the two galaxies will be brought back round again and again until they merge at the center with each iteration hundreds of billions of stars will be rippled by gravity and sent cascading in all directions yet despite the sheer quantity of stars involved it's statistically unlikely that any two will actually collide as the space between stars is incomparably larger than the stars themselves that being said stars will pass within range of one another wreaking havoc on the orbits of their finely balanced planetary systems the fate of the solar system ultimately depends on its position during and after the merger have run scores of simulations to ascertain a final resting place for the sun but there's no clear consensus on the one hand the solar system could be ejected considerably further out maybe into the bounds of andromeda or perhaps even kicked into intergalactic space altogether alternatively the sun may be flung inwards towards the turret heart of the new galaxy where it may be ripped to shreds as it comes within range of the core around seven billion years from now the merger events were complete with the combining of each galaxy's nucleus i.e when its two black holes collide these supermassive black holes will gradually begin to orbit one another as they use their dynamic energy to catapult stars out of their way their orbits will decay and they will sink towards the center when they come within one light year of each other they will start losing energy in the form of gravitational waves generating immense tidal ripples which will be felt for billions of light years across space ultimately these two black holes will merge at the center creating a new supermassive black hole which binds the heart of the new galaxy and after this the final phase of the local group's evolution will have commenced a new supergiant elliptical galaxy unoriginally named milcomodo galaxy collisions like this one are commonplace throughout the universe and have played an important role in forming rich diverse spiral galaxies suitable for habitable worlds like our own but this cycle of collisions and mergers has a limit and once the elliptical galaxy has taken shape it will not change its morphology much from there instead it will gradually absorb the remainder of its satellite galaxies over billions of years including the triangulum galaxy which will likely orbit the new galaxy in the meantime it will take more than 150 billion years before the last members of the local group have been consumed by this monster galaxy but once they have that will be it forever long before that happens star-forming gases within andromeda and the milky way will be exhausted and less will remain for milcomodo to repopulate its stars when it finally forms thus while the elliptical galaxy is projected to undergo a productive starburst phase a vigorous star formation this phase will be brief and less fruitful than those we've seen in other elliptical galaxies with no new stars to accompany old ones the general stellar population of milkomeda will age an ever increasing share of its stars progressing into the red giant phase where they will either explode or evolve into white dwarfs as this happens the expansion of the universe will speed up pushing galaxies beyond the local group far out of reach ultimately destined to become undetectable we will never encounter or even see another large galaxy again and save for a few small minor mergers within the local group's remaining dwarf galaxies milk commodore will run out of rejuvenation mechanisms to keep itself replenished the galaxy will stagnate and will start to die out it will happen incredibly slowly over tens of quadrillions of years in fact but the galaxy stars will eventually cool to a temperature of just 5 kelvin at which point they will no longer be hot enough to keep themselves luminous and they will freeze into solid impenetrable spheres of matter their life-giving elements locked away inside bit by bit our galaxy will become darker and dimmer and once the last star has faded away the story of andromeda and the milky way will be over thankfully humanity was born in the middle of this great galactic story long after its chaotic opening and long before its eternal depressing ending andromeda's story is more intertwined with the milky ways than the likes of al sufy curtis shapley and hubble could ever have imagined and given that it's only been around 100 years since we realized that m31 was another galaxy imagine what incredible knowledge our descendants will uncover in the next century [Music] [Music] you,35:19
1J2YOLQM2Yc,JCS - Criminal Psychology,Informative,The Case of Michael Rafferty,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J2YOLQM2Yc,2 years ago,10M views,Informative,"at exactly 3:25 p.m. on April 8th of 2009 the dismissal bell rang at Oliver Stevens School in Woodstock Ontario and hundreds of grade schoolers were seen leaving the premises yet one eight-year-old was captured on surveillance leaving two minutes later than the rest as she had to run back inside to get her mother's butterfly earrings that were left on her desk her name was Tori Stafford and on that Wednesday afternoon she never returned home she was reported missing by her grandmother at exactly 6:04 p.m. and a missing-persons investigation was launched immediately roughly 7 hours later surveillance footage from a local high school was discovered capturing what police say was the missing child walking side-by-side an unidentified woman Tori did not appear to be struggling in the video and the woman was described as between 19 to 25 years of age white 5 foot 2 and about 125 pounds with a black ponytail the local police made a public appeal for the woman in the video to come forward and Tori's grandparents offered a $10,000 reward for her return a Facebook group dedicated to finding her gained over 20,000 followers in under 24 hours on April 12th 4 days after her disappearance hundreds gather in Woodstock at 8 p.m. to hold a vigil for Tori and her mother makes a tearful televised appeal for the return of her missing daughter over the following week Tori's parents are interviewed by investigators and each of them pass a polygraph test police call off ground searches six days after the child's disappearance after finding no clues nor leads the day after America's Most Wanted features Tori's case as its top story on April 17th the Ontario provincial police take the lead in the investigation and the ground searches recommends the case was then officially classed as an abduction not just a missing person they step up a media campaign by releasing a composite sketch of the woman in the video and then circulate the image on social media and local news outlets on May 19th police attained information that the woman is 18 year old Terry Lynn McClintock who is already in custody for breaching a probation order for a previous drug violation she was transferred to the Ontario Police Headquarters and interviewed at roughly 5:30 p.m. by Detective Sergeant Jim Smith she initially denied being the woman in the video and claim to know nothing about the missing girl but roughly 45 minutes into the interrogation she breaks I think it goes right back to what you said a few times you didn't want to see it but that doesn't change the fact that you saw it's hard to talk about I know it's even harder to talk about in the section part of it okay but you saw it she describes in disturbing detailed the abduction and killing of Tori Stafford stating that she lured the girl into a secluded parking space with a promise of showing her a puppy she was then forced into the backseat of a vehicle that immediately drove away in the driver's seat was 28-year old michael Rafferty who then drove to a secluded area about a hundred miles north of Woodstock he then proceeded to sexually assault and then murder the eight year old with the fatal injuries being four strikes to the head with a claw hammer McLintock drew a rough sketch of the area where Tori was killed which eventually led police to discover the girl's remains she was found with lacerations to her liver and sixteen broken ribs but her eventual cause of death correlated with Terry's testimony as was confirmed to be the result of repeated blows to the head with a blunt object at 7:55 p.m. that evening Michael Rafferty is arrested and informed that he is being charged with kidnapping and first-degree murder he has read his rights and then brought to the police headquarters for immediate interrogation while I didn't grab a chair that's a long fool so that's a blanket for either ok tea I think they might have only put one sugar and I dig out a peg stuff there's a plane going up there we're gonna see really get hungry ok are you hungry now I get you a full meal if you want bacon eggs or no that's okay you can lessen few many questions as we go along but no issues there at all okay I got a few things I'll talk to you about as I told you my name is crest my last name is long you go Michael Michael what's your preference doesn't matter okay I'll probably call you Mike so what's that really offend you just leave it with me I have over a few things here today okay Mike like I say don't be shy you'll find them pretty relaxed pretty laid-back because I've dealt with these types of issues before the Ontario Provincial Police have a highly trained Behavioral Sciences unit and they're subdivision of forensic psychiatry is recognized as one of the best in the world at first you will see the familiar strategy of rapport development the investigator will retain a friendly and almost nonchalant disposition throughout the opening phase of the interrogation the perception of solidarity and respect will make the suspect more likely to cooperate and take things into consideration while the detectives easygoing disposition will also downplay the severity of the crime thus making the gravity of admission far less intimidating you have a question I have no issues getting any food there so if there's something that you want he'll give you some food there's no problems and always say that four equal five minutes but my job is as I mentioned to hear from what's called the behavioral sciences section now we're talking about the missing person one that tore East Africa missing I know you're falling a little bit in the media you follow some little bits and pieces that there was behavioral sciences people involved right then sometimes they were criminal profilers and other members in that well threat assessment that's what one of my roles is as well and threat assessment what my job is is to determine the risk okay what's the risk of a certain situation the situation that we're talking about it you're gonna find here that there's nothing you're gonna tell me to surprise me okay for two reasons one I've heard a lot of this stuff before the second reason is I'm fortunate enough to know what all the case bags are okay so what I have to do is assess is assess what I perceive is is a threat so are you gonna go out and kill more people after this situation okay doesn't my job is to assess assess threat level alright there you know you're you're responsible for what so that's what my job is is to determine okay what's happened here all right staff sergeant Chris loam had been a police officer for over 21 years and was a member of the Behavioral Sciences unit for the last 17 at the time this interrogation took place he was the head of the analysis section this meant he was in charge of criminal profiling threat assessment and forensic psychiatry he indicates that his only purpose is to assess the suspects threat level yet this variety of threat assessment is only applied to less severe infractions with relation to rape and murder the serious nature of the crime means that the threat level is already assessed long before any form of psycho analysis takes place in reality the investigators primary purpose is to gain an understanding of the suspects character and then use this knowledge to try and influence both his reasoning and decision-making before we go through all that people just don't wake up one day and decide this is gonna happen and I know that all right so there's a lot of ideas that go on people's heads at the time and if if I go through and I and I have I go through your history in your background there's not a whole hell of a lot you've been involved in it like is ER right you're completely under the radar anyways I got to go through a few things with you here all right obviously you're you're upset by what's going on you're here for a reason and right back at the beginning the investigators in the case manager the officers charge said that I'm going to follow the evidence and go where the evidence leads me okay and now you're here because the evidences has led the investigators to you all right and I get involved after after that there's been people that I worked with and Behavioral Sciences that have been here from the outset of the investigation but really at this at this point in time saying while I do win and look at your history there's very little on there like so you've flown on the radar you haven't had any major problems with the with the police okay but and all of a sudden you're involved in this situation and it's a serious situation and that's a serious situation I'm sure you're you're quite upset and quite concerned about what to what's going on here alright now the last one I was involved with like this I don't know if you're aware of it was a girl named Holly Jones entranc she went missing and the guy that had abducted her his name was Michael Breer and what he was doing is he was watching on his computer for hours and hours and hours he was looking a teleport to the point that he decides I wanna go try this and he goes and he grabs Holly and he does some things to her and then he realizes what am I gonna do okay any panics he doesn't know what to do because she's a witness now and he says I just let her go she's gonna tell on me so he decides that he's not gonna let her go all right and all I was from something as simple as watching child pornography for hours on end these things happen okay and we can't say it happening close to home Toronto is not that far from okay these things happen all the time all right so what I need to do is sit with you all right you know how I know the who's right why I mean why is up to you but I can actually probably fill in that blank for you but that's not what my rule here is if I'm going to assess risk here and see number one do you even feel bad about what you've done that's the first thing I look for and number two do I think okay he doesn't feel bad so I'm attorneys probably going to do this again because he really doesn't care about it the first time it's happened okay I'm not at all upset with you I'm not mad at you I don't mind sitting here talk with you you'll know if I don't want to talk to you because I'll just simply leave right from from reading about you this to me seems like it's out of character no I could be wrong right you may have you may have been playing this for a long period of time and you may have thoroughly enjoyed this and if I'm wrong then you tell me that all right but I also know that we all make mistakes okay that's why pencils have erasers okay because we all make mistakes it's that simple spending time with you here and if I'm wrong if you tell me what it looks like if you could turn back time there was a few decisions in life you'd made a little bit different all right if I could turn back time for you Mike I would but it's not that simple okay so now you and I have to sit here and face what's happened okay I can tell you what happened I can take you through the day her disappearance okay I mean I've seen the I've seen the video all right and I know that you didn't do this alone and but at the end of the day we've got it got to deal with this situation okay because it's it's a young girl that we got to talk about and if you and I don't sit and talk about your site then people who only think the worst right it's human nature right you've done a night down we always think the worst until we know the facts okay so that's what you and I need to sit here and work and discuss and work through again if I'm wrong you tell me okay but I really believe if you could turn back time you would do this I'll deal with this a little bit different okay and there may have been a Russian they've been exciting for a period of time but then reality sets in you know sitting over the fact of what's happening okay that's what we're doing here just deal with what's happened really at this point what you have left is your word and your credibility and people always think the worst okay till they know the truth you do it I do it is human nature so we're all gonna think the worst until we know why this is happening in your mind and again if it's something we're really quite cubrir where you looked at a lot of child porn and then decided you were going to try it and that's fine if it wasn't your idea then that's fine too but we can't change the case facts are all right you know deep down that this is your chance to get it off your chest so you're not sitting there the rest of your life saying I guess I should have said something all right I guess I should have got it off my chest but said my site because this is your last chance to do it the fact that you're here and the fact that they've already they know where where the victim is okay and they know your steps this is it you have to take the steps now to live the rest of your life this is what you have to do you do not need to talk about this okay it's always interesting to examine a suspects demeanor while being interrogated especially compared to how they most likely were while committing their violation the suspect here is a quivering mess acting like a helpless victim wallowing in his own self-pity while vying for sympathy essentially the opposite of how he was while attacking Tori Stafford it's ironic that the powerless and vulnerable complexion he is trying to portray here is exactly what his victim would have felt at the time she was attacked the sympathy he is trying to garner for himself is clearly what he lacked for the eight-year-old child he raped and murdered I've got a determined as part of my job when all is said and done here do I think Mike's done this is that he's made his mistake he realizes how wrong he a mistake that he made he's willing to look past it or do I have to sit here and say all right my report is gonna see very simple I think this guys are gonna reoffended that's what our job is we deal with these types of situations and the reasons why people do this stuff okay like you say this may have been a thing that you just snap and did something that stuff happens or maybe something you planned for many months I got some enjoyment out of the part I didn't do anything well that's not entirely true like I didn't do anything you can try and cement yourself into that okay any good the investigator wants to come across as empathetic and understanding yet still needs to keep the suspects confidence low he watches for denials and stops them immediately letting the suspect deny his guilt will only increase his morale thus increases psychological endurance and constancy for self-preservation this needs to be stripped away as much as possible as early as possible because by not being truthful all you have left is your credibility that's all you have left okay you're not the only person who's been arrested and charged okay there's no surprises left anymore okay the lease is not even a surprise it's why this happening oh so no the only innocent person who's ever been arrested in charge well that's true there's been people that have been arrested for things where there's no evidence but unfortunately in this case there's lots of things to determine your role in this crime okay the girl who's who's on the video who walks away with Tori has been identified and she's been identified as her aunt or being in your car and the three of you you and her and Tori go to the gwelf area go to the Home Depot okay and the grabbing of Tori there was a was a planned event that you were going to grab her you're gonna grab a girl the other person was going to do it the other person got the girl put her in your car all right and there's other steps that are taken from there okay there's things that happened at Home Depot there's things the things that happen on site and well there's things that happened to Tori all right before she's gone and you're involved in it and you can't you can't master that you can't change people because what's happened is happened I can't turn back the hands of time and neither can you okay there's there's nothing I can do to turn back the hands of time I see I wish my quitter reacted to this situation a little bit differently okay there's no doubt in my mind okay there's no doubt in my mind that you're involved in the abduction okay love Tori no doubt my mind at all I followed the evidence I've read the file okay there's no doubt in my mind we're past that okay and the only concern or the issue that I have is why you did this what caused you to do this was it something you would like to say is it something you've done before and you've been involved in the death of other people and you divide this am i sitting across the desk from Paul Bernardo here I might sitting across from someone who's made a mistake okay and that's gonna be the question that's asked of you all right get you a bucket there just a second you're gonna get sick booth sir okay I've seen it before you're not gonna offend here both of you so you got to be sick Mike or in hit [Music] you're gonna be sick just just grab the bucket they're handy for you you and I need to have a discussion this isn't this isn't a parking ticket okay this is this is reality okay and people have already told you you know this people assume the worst until they know the truth okay and people are going us from the worst of you unless you and I sit here and clarify it okay something's pushed you to do this feeling that you can't just fly to the radar your entire life okay like it doesn't happen but it's not realist I'm not gonna sit tell you that something brings this on when you sit and talk to someone who had a troubled life like Michael Briere and just gets pushed into doing this and panics and thinks what would it be like to to take a kid and touch and rub a kid and then wish you could stop okay and people can and that's the whole issue here right the detective seems to be almost rambling here but this is a common strategy used to keep a suspects mind racing when Rafferty is concentrating on what the detective is saying it doesn't give him a chance to conjure up his own thoughts making it very hard for him to either think up a lie or disassociate from the situation altogether it's a methodical process of breaking a suspect down through mental exhaustion and slowly chipping away in his psychological stamina piece by piece we can't control every emotion all right we can't control some of our urges some of our thoughts none of us can okay and I can't look in the face and say I haven't made a mistake or made a bad decision in life because I have but the reality of it is you and I have to accept that and move on okay because I can walk up there and never see you again like I can do that right my job here is done the job here is done as you'll find out tomorrow as things start to to be released there is no more questions there is no more long drawn-out investigations there already sending people home to spend time with their families okay they're scaling back what's happened because it's been cleared and they know what's happened the pieces of evidence have been gathered so that's that's reality I can't downplay that well you and I need to walk out of here together okay with what happened here you and I have to sit and see this is what push Mike over at the top this is what push Mike to get involved in something like this because if we don't then you sit here on your only you have to take it okay is that necessarily fair all right just sit here on my own anyways and take this to an extent you do yes you sit there and decide am I going to get rid of this and get this off my chest so people understand my sight or am I gonna sit there curled up and keep it in for the rest of my life all right you need to be realistic about this okay you have no battle plan to deal with this great it's happened to spawn a control anything okay if I recall for what am I gonna do or your plan isn't gonna work okay cuz you're not built for this [ __ ] this isn't what's your boat okay you're not some sick bastard right that the system gets enjoyment out of hurting people all right so now you have to live with this okay and to live with it one of the first ways right it's like if someone's an alcoholic what's the first thing you have to do knowledge they've got the issue all right you have an issue here in that there's overwhelming evidence compelling evidence that indicates you're involved in what's happened okay and I can't change that you can't change that at this stage but you need to be honest and you need to understand your credibility like is all you have left all you have left from here on in is your credibility and you sitting here saying nothing doesn't do you a bit of good because no one's gonna know and then all of a sudden ten years in our five years now you decided to say something who's gonna lesson nobody okay this is your chance to say your piece all right like you say if you want and you can see probably I'm trying not to it of respect actually for you but I can sit and get as graphic as I want okay because none of this stuff bothers me because I've seen it hundreds of times okay but if I sit go over what what's happening here with Tori you may not be real happy about it because it's gonna cause you to relive all this crap okay and maybe you want to because I can tell you I've sat with guys that wanted me to say it again so they could hear what they've accomplished I've had them or they want me to say it two and three times because they get a rush out of that I don't think that's you okay you're not some sick guy okay I'm not sitting across from Paul Bernardo okay I know that and I know people that have set across from him okay and I know two officers that have in different stages of their lives okay and I know what he's all about you're not that guy all right but at the same time you can't just sit here and say well this all goes away right this isn't like a list your girlfriend gives you to say here's a list of things to do can you go pick up a few things at the grocery store for me to get some gas this isn't what that is okay this is a lot more serious than that to-do list we need to deal with reality and the reality of it is your credibility is all you have left at this point if you sit there and say nothing everybody's going to assume the worst okay and you may be painted with a picture that you're not real happy with okay I'm the only one that feels like sitting in here with you right there's no investigators lined up in here sitting with you why do you think that is right because they've been working on this room for weeks okay they're tired and they've been away from their families and none of them wanna come in here and talk to you okay I have no issue that I'm neutral I don't have these issues I haven't been away from my family I don't like talking teamplay I've talked to people that have been involved in things far worse than what they're saying you did here far worse okay I can sit and list of things that I've been involved in there people have done things that have been a threat to our national security terrorism in Canada or I dealt with people that have been involved in murdering three people all right I've been involved with people who have abducted and taken life of children I've been involved I've dealt with many people who are sex offenders at habitué and repeatedly touching molest children I've dealt with that it does not stuff doesn't bother me okay but what's going on here is is that you're just in there you're just a big bundle of nerves and you don't know what to do you know whether to sit here shake shet puke you don't know what to do but the reality of it is at the end of the day the evidence is the evidence okay and the evidence clearly shows you're responsible for the abduction of Tory okay and I also know that she's no longer with us okay and you're responsible for that too okay there's there's a sexual component to this as well so you might want to sit and get this off your chest and go through your side with me all right because if I just walk away at minimum that's what people are going to think at minimum but you have some explaining to do okay that's reality I can't change that okay if this is something that got out of control that you just planned on taking and you thought you were going to put her back or bridges take her for a ride that's fine it get it ahead then we need to talk about that okay you need to sit and explain that and say why okay if not then I say people think the worst until they know there is no other way you don't have any other options there's nothing else that you can do to change what's happened to her we can't turn back time however we can explain how things got off the rails whether it was something that happened slowly or just went right off the rails right from then from the beginning why do you think the OPP has a behavioral sciences section this is all the stuff that we do it okay we deal with occurrences that are unusual we deal with situations that aren't regular situations and that's not what this is this isn't a regular situation this is a couple of people that made a series of decisions that hopefully they understand aren't quite right and if they feel bad about I don't think that you're some kind of monster if I did you'll find me pretty candid you'll find that I'll come right up and tell you like okay I don't think that okay I think this got out of control I think it good out of hand okay are you some kind of monster or did you make a mistake here you made a mistake right this is a mistake right monk you take it back if you could this is a mistake right Mike you take it back if you could turn back the hands of time like would you tame this would you do this a little bit different like talking to you if you turn back the hands of time you're not some monster you made a mistake right you take this back if you could this is a mistake Mike you need to deal with this monkey I know that I did not do what you think I did I know you did we're past that you know or past that Mike okay I know you're not a monster if you did if I if I thought your monster I would tell you I'm not gonna I'm gonna be honest with you I wouldn't just walk out I would spend some time with you for that you're a monster just because I want to see what makes you tick you're not a monster all right this thing is consumed you look at you right you can barely eat or drink you haven't touched your doughnut right why is that because your guts are eating yourself up inside okay you can't sit and say that you're innocent you know what's the first thing you do when you get in here you just laid down and curl up right it's all over you know it's over okay you know it's done okay not to be an expert in body language all you've done is later on in the field position since you've been here that's not how innocent people aren't that's not how people that are falsely accused of something is the lies that anything possibly that it's free I haven't eaten since noon it couldn't be that this is all just a huge huge shock to me no there has been any of that at all most probably all of that but it's also a fact that here you're involved in it it's probably all of that Mike okay the fact that maybe you have eaten that much and maybe you are cool there's no question the first thing you said to me was you're cold hungry so that's why you're happy that stuff okay and all I'm willing to accept that maybe that is part of the issue okay but there is a bigger there is a larger issue there okay and it's the issue of the evidence the issue that you're involved in this okay and we can't change that I have no ill will anger towards you I have none you don't - you don't make me mad you don't upset me nothing like that okay the only issue I have is I don't fully understand I volunteered here come here and shoot the show because I've talked to people in worse situations than you okay and like I say you've been pretty respectful with me you're not giving me a hard time you're not being rude to me so I'll sit with you because but you know the reality of it is I can walk away and you're gonna sit and deal with this on your own for the rest of your life you're a smart guy you're not you're nobody's fool you know what you know the situation you know you're in a tough spot and again this is your opportunity to to save your peace but you've got some pretty serious explaining to do here okay in the big picture now with Obie if I just leave you here you got some stuff that you need to explain I have acknowledged already what my thoughts are of you all kind of told you that from the beginning this is a casket okay maybe I'm wrong maybe that's why you don't want to talk you could maybe you're thinking oh you know what Chris you're wrong you know maybe I have done this before maybe I find it on doing plan on doing it again alright I don't think that but I mean you could be sitting here playing you're right how would I know okay I can tell you that I don't think that's the case because I've sat across from a lot of people again that have been through stuff a lot - a lot worse than you you made a mistake not deal with it and we move on I am concerned that you're just gonna sit here oh well take a chance and maybe go just leave it'll all work itself up well possibly this is not gonna work itself vote okay we're past that you need to acknowledge what's caused you to do this and I have never said for a second that you went and took that kid from the school because you didn't that kid was taken from that school all right by Terry and put in your car okay and you were there and you were part of when the kid was drove driven to Guelph okay and the home depot and then from there the kid into the demise of the kid this is the stuff we need to explain it nobody can control your destiny no but you okay I can I mean I've already told you I've already put my cards on the table this is your chance man do you not think you're gonna feel building to feel better getting some of this off your chest as opposed to keeping it there forever you don't I mean I'll sit with you and do this there's no issues with it at all I say I have an old promise that money meant well we just find a starting point we'll do it because you're gonna sit and stew forevers and now I should have said this or shouldn't have said that right it's up to you I mean I've got situations where I wish I'd have told somebody something that I didn't and I regretted my whole life okay situations with family members we used to have said your piece or you should have kept your mouth shut but we all of those experiences but this is your chance to say your piece all right I think you and I should take that chance I think you and I should just sit and have that discussion how's it gonna get worse right it can't and obviously to an extent someone's put you in this position right we need to deal with that you want me to tell you things I didn't do so I so I can get locked up for the rest of my life for this oh I want you to tell me things she didn't did not do it no I'm gonna ask you a question what's your biggest fear or your biggest concern now that you've been charged with this what's your biggest concern here losing my life I wanna know what this girl Terry said okay she acknowledges that she she grabbed Tori and brought her to your car that it was your wishes you sent her there with certain things that you were looking for in a victim and she took her and you guys drove on the highway and did the Home Depot thing when she talked about after the Home Depot to a secluded area you had sexual relations with Tori and Tori was killed this is your time matter this is as good as it gets unfortunately all right this is it I mean I can get into more detail if you want but in a nutshell that's a polite way of saying what the allegations are but if there's stuff there's there's other people here it's happening that means this process what happens happens next after you and I are done talking you go back to yourself what's called a be brought into court and the charges will be read to you again and there'll be a discussion if you get out of custody for for bail and then they may schedule a bail hearing to determine that from there it's a matter of where it goes from the courts investigation will go on for a little while yet there's a couple things it was I told you they need to be done the big picture you're you're facing these charges the reality of it is we can just deal with the issue here just as easy the suspect remains unyielding after 95 minutes of psychological pressure so the investigators commence the next stage of the interrogation they initiate the Mutt and Jeff technique most commonly known in pop culture as good cop bad cop Blake here wanted to see what Terry Lynn had to say Mike Terry Lynn still speaking my partner okay this is a girl you killed all right she's not missing anymore she's dead Terry Lynn was asked today if she wanted to call a lawyer four times she said no all four times she went through two boxes of Kleenex all right she says on the ether April Wednesday the a through April 2009 at 3:30 in the afternoon you drop her off a PV south of fife south of the public school where Tory walks out of each other you get a girl and you want to young she walks up the street you drive up the old-age home you park your car she walks up to Tori Tori he's nice to her she trusts her she holds her hand for a little bit she walks up the street with her Terri Lynne tells her but her little dog gets her across the street to your car opens the back door Tori doesn't like it anymore she pushes her in the car you start driving she said she's freaking out she said she's worried but you she's scared what what you're gonna do she said you guys hit the 401 start driving to Guelph you're parked outside of help she could win for a little while you come up with some drugs she thinks you driving to the Home Depot you park at the end of the parking lot you tell her it's her time returned to get out of the car you tell her to go in there you give her some cash dude you don't want to use your debit card so you don't track it she goes in there she gets garbage behaves like she's told to do when she comes back out and you go driving and you pull into a farmer's foot right across from a house the point where you're even asked her if anybody can see you and what does she do she says she goes for a walk because she doesn't want to see what happens then she goes back yeah I was sitting in the front seat anymore Mike you're sitting in the back seat and she's not liking what she sees so she walks away again then she comes back and you make her hold one of those garbage bags while you put some of your clothes in her jacket and hammer in the garbage bag any drive to a gas station she never sees Tory again if you drive in a gas station you get out you wash up you dump the bag you drive back to Woodstock that's Terri Lynn story Mike that's Terri Lynn story well she follows her eyes out through two boxes of Kleenex and I asked for four times hey you want to call her she says I don't need to call her I feel so bad about what happened I just want to tell you all about it that's what you're up against Terry Wentz a lawyer well you're the only person who can tell us that but then just did ain't gonna be careful I'm like uh some of the [ __ ] she said is backed by not just video but other evidence but also some of the explanations as she gave as well or verified that's that's a little more graphic and I said it but yeah there's some stuff that she says there's like 20 years old you want to tell us your side of the story get rid of your [ __ ] security blanket and start being a man because it's not gonna be her semen that we find on her body we look at the areas underneath the parts of the seat that you cut out we're gonna find her blood do you know how blood works you know about red blood cells white blood cells white blood cells are thinner they look like spit when they're separating from red blood cells they're the ones that seeped through into the phone that's what we get the DNA from skin cells from her rubbing up and down against your seats in your car Torrey Stafford is all over your car all over it and Terri Lynn explains everything that she knows we're going to find you're explaining nothing so I don't give a [ __ ] if you say one more word tell your truth all right we're done well I'm done with you anyway this officer here is trying to understand what the hell you're going through I don't care who are you in the lead investigator here okay Terry wins pull this [ __ ] mom that's gonna be a funny thing for you to say in court is it out there because how is the DNA gonna be full of [ __ ] Mike huh how's the biologist from the center Friends of science is going to be full of [ __ ] how's the pathologist that examines her body gonna be full of [ __ ] explain that to me be careful Mike that's the painters roadie well but there's something you know I can clarify with what she said that let's clarify it but we can't just sit here with a blanket statement that she's full of [ __ ] because there are some things that's truthful and what you saying that makes it takes away your credibility so we're gonna be very careful about this officers got a job to do Mike he's got a different job than I do for my investigation you keep my mouth shut as the best thing can happen so keep on keepin it shut okay the theory behind good cop bad cop is known as the fear then relief response it's believed that when the immediate shift from one emotion to the next is so extreme a suspect can become disoriented and their ability to think critically can be affected this specific state of disorientation makes compliance more likely as the rapid change of emotion can evoke the feeling of uncertainty in a suspects positive response to an oncoming request as a form of coping with this uncertainty this is of course not a guaranteed system and a suspect will not always respond in the desired manner but anyways at the same time what he's saying is right like I didn't watch watch what she was saying and she was very emotional there's no question and she did go through Kleenex there's no Washington and she was upset and there's stuff that she said that I mean it was clearly known ahead of time by the investigators and their stuff that was said that by her saying it later proved up to be confirmed other way so don't its can't say don't you do everybody want but just be careful about that really anyways but if plague Z&Y she said that doesn't change my opinion our discussion spread honest they got their opinions and now he's never even sick illicit activities so they said their piece but I've got no yes but like say this is your chance this is your chance to to see your piece he just pooped enough to say anything more so that's up to you to say that's what he said he doesn't want you to talk to him with that's why I'm still interested in listening to you I want to talk about the part of the school where she's grabbed you can discuss that and see what your thoughts are there why because because of the officer because of what the lawyer said now it's everything I just were you guys gonna have the next I'm not sure I don't know someone runs in here and starts barking you just want me to say whatever you just want me to say things so it's it's open and closed so it's over and Emily that's it this how it is nothing more to talk about no actually because yeah you know actually s not that's your that's fair that's a very fair statement actually but but I got to tell you in this case it's not it doesn't matter so yeah compelled and I'm interested to listen to what you have to say but it doesn't open and shut this case No I'm ready till new why just because of all the different angles and all it I'm just I just don't feel comfortable talking about it so you're prepared then they just leave it like this they're gonna write it up from here see where it goes yep that's the best way to do it I don't know I've never been in this chair before I don't know any questions of me hey somebody can't become care if I need something why would you say that you don't I wouldn't ask me care here for your job you know I could have walked it off fast because you got right here yes I know that you're gonna go back and sit and sleep or do whatever for a while and you'd be better to do it on a full stomach that's all it is to event I don't have to ask you if you want a food but I am prepared to get you food sometimes you can eat and then you can say well look II had an appetite this is how he must have been feeling okay drink his tea this is how he must be feeling forget the pie he's disturbing and are you reading too much into it man I offered you something cos if you're hungry I don't care if you eat it or not right I mean it's up to you it doesn't matter to me the eater you don't eat anyone anywhere in any of your reports what's up that I eat or not eat no this is on the video doesn't matter eat your nuts not to write any report it my report doesn't say the ate or not my report says what we talked about this is a very intriguing moment of the interrogation as the suspect State of Mind seems to be in two places at once he is undoubtedly clinging on to hope made evident by his outright refusal to admit involvement yet he still has situational awareness he knows deep down that his act isn't being bought giving reason for his guilt in requesting food he would have been starving at this moment yet his primary concern was how he would be perceived while eating he is caught between wanting to satisfy his hunger and trying to appear so guilt ridden by the circumstances that he doesn't even care about his hunger here [Music] yes was had a discussion I don't think there's any animosity between us so we had a discuss about what the case facts are and that was that so it doesn't matter to me if you if he turn up it was legitimate offer if you want something all arranged for you yeah there's no issues that way I read too much [ __ ] man do you want something to eat I need something to eat yes get some feet look at me in reality no food was coming the suspect had it right when he stated that the investigator didn't care about his hunger and he wasn't about to go out of his way to get a takeaway meal for a child-killer the mud and Jeff technique although very well executed was unsuccessful on this occasion I'm pretty get down to the facts kind of guy I'm sure you've realized that from her brief encounter earlier all right this is not rocket science I've got what Terri Lynn just told me this afternoon and about you this is your opportunity Terry let's sitting right here tell us she's a liar you've got no problem that's and with her out over the route Terry's a liar that's what you're hoping you know even looking at her I don't need to yeah they're looking at anyway you might walk okay I'm not gonna I'm not gonna pull any punches here okay I'm not gonna try and kiss your ass right detective Smith's behavior in the following moments is not associated with any techniques nor strategies he knows the suspects inclination is virtually set and unlikely to be influenced any further from this point onward the following onslaught doesn't have any tactical purposes related to the investigation the detective has understandably become emotionally invested in the case and proceeds to give the prime suspect the psychological grilling he deserves and I know the guys from Behavioral Sciences they got their thing they're trying to understand why that's what they do you guys all work together yeah we do they're good people they know their job very well and sure as hell I'd like to know why all right I'd like to think that we don't have people walking around our communities who just because they're bored on an afternoon say hey why don't we grab that girl and rape and murderer okay I'd like to think that we live in a community where people think a little bit more about what they're going to do than that do you think you're coming off as an innocent guy do you think you're looking like somebody who's been wrongfully accused here you're gonna see it however you want to see my lawyer or the Lord instructed me to just say yeah I know Mike I know similarly Jacques did you say but that doesn't make an innocent man that makes you a man who was saying holy [ __ ] what am I gonna do now nothing I do is gonna change your opinion so I might as well just follow the Laureus advice well you're right there Mike nothing you do is gonna get you walking out of this police station tonight without being charged with murder and torie Stafford you're right you know how much media coverage just has you know what the newspapers are going to do with this and to your family tomorrow okay you think the cops we're gonna be talking to everybody you ever spoke to in your life that's nothing compared to what the media is going to be doing this is a huge story for them this is the next Paul Bernardo whether you like it or not a girl and a guy kid not be an eight-year-old girl and murdering her that's one of the most sensational things that have happened in this province since Bernardo and Karla it's going to be a frenzy and you and I both know that you know the psychopath is me I have never met one well I just met one tonight I just find it funny how you can how you can go full sure on something when you don't know well Mike when somebody tells me that they were present when a man killed an eight-year-old girl somebody told you that mm-hmm she did okay when that happens okay we don't say oh well maybe after maybe after we go golfing for the week will go and see Mike and see what he has to say it's not the way it works No so let's just pick them up and then say yep you did it because that's obviously got to be the right way to go about things so the last thing I cover off with everybody I talked to in situations like this mic is pretty straightforward okay Rodney Stafford and Tara McDonald have to be notified about this first question out of their mouth is going to be what did they say why they did it I'm sure one of those two will have the answer for you why somebody would do it what are you getting at like you don't really for me but I don't it doesn't matter doesn't know you're gonna talk to him anyways you know what my if you're gonna claim you have no lavalla whatsoever don't play games with me and throw a little hints to see so what comes up in game there's no and there's nobody involved in this except for you and Terry Lynn we're going is that what you said to Tory before you killed her we're done funny man that's what you think this is is funny right here right here I think you're a cold-blooded killer as you and I haven't spent too much more time now than you forest tourism Stafford to spend in your car you could have let her out anywhere along that route you could have you could have killed her without sexually assault here and that's what I wanted to sit across from tonight see what it's like to sit across from the guy who when he abducts an eight-year-old girl it's so turned on by it that before he kills her he has to have sex with her so if you asked me why I'm sitting in this room I'm sitting in this room for Tory making you squirm put you through some of the grief that you put her through that's why I'm in here Mike and I'm having a good time you are a sick puppy Michael eight years old my eight years old but all she wanted to do was go home a little party for her friends because her mom just redecorated her room for that's pure evil but and that's exactly what the judge is going to see that's what you are no remorse no empathy you're just Hollow nice thing about plays you're gonna be spend good chunk of your life yes they actually have glass cells so you know Bernardo can make googly eyes at each other all day whatever you guys do on there it was nice meeting you Mikey sure the rest your life this is the kind of room you're gonna be spending it and it was all for this little girl right here not just Tori but for every little child in Canada that doesn't deserve what happened to her good evening thanks for joining us 31 year old Michael Rafferty has been found guilty of murdering kidnapping and sexually assaulting eight year old Tori Stafford it's been 10 nearly 10 very long weeks of trial in London which is where Laura silky has been covering this story since the very beginning in the courtroom when the verdict was read out there was a collective sigh of yes for each time one of those guilty verdicts was read out through friends and family that came with the reading of each verdict guilty of first degree guilty of abduction and guilty of sexual assault lawyers from both sides of the story came out to speak with us as well their reaction everyone appreciating the justice was done here and everyone of them also thanking the work that the jury had to do for having to sit through this case for as you mentioned Carolyn almost 10 weeks it's been a long and difficult trial for everybody the trial is finally over so that's a good thing but the verdict means that the jury has found that Michael Rafferty did kidnap sexually assault and murder Victoria Stafford and our thoughts are with Victoria's family we have our decision for you to take cases like this it's never easy but honestly I mean somebody has to take them it's I get asked that question more often than almost anything else how can you do a case like this how can you defend such a person the reality of it is that everybody in our system deserves a frong proper and effective defense even even before going into the courtroom there was really a sense of excitement I think a lot of the family thought that because the verdict did come so quickly just just over a day of deliberations they will truly believed that this was going to be a guilty verdict then going into the courtroom that simply continued the relief that went over the set it was really almost unbelievable to hear the the sighs that went through everyone in that courtroom Carolyn both Michael Rafferty and Terry Lynn McClintock were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for 25 years",58:33

AAfwfZr0EHo,DRIVETRIBE,"Automobile,Comedy",James May gave us a tour of his new pub,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAfwfZr0EHo,,3M views,"Automobile,Comedy",hello viewers this is the royal oak in the village of swallow cliff south wiltshire and i own half of it [Music] now i've been told that there's never been a worse time to buy half a pub this pub has been closed for over a year because it's never made a profit and the previous owners had had enough and we also know that pubs in britain have been closing down at an alarming rate almost ten thousand in the last decade coupled to that since the early thousands the duty on beer has been going up alarmingly while the price of supermarket booze has been going down meaning more people buy it from the supermarket and drink at home and then we have the pandemic now under the new pandemic rules there can be no standing at the bar there has to be table service only the tables have to be spaced more widely apart to maintain social distancing and a lot of people are simply nervous about going to the pub this means capacity is reduced by about 50 percent and if the capacity of the pub goes down by more than 25 percent it goes into the red yes there has never been a worse time to buy half a pup but let's look on the bright side at least nobody else wanted it do you wanna have a look inside step this way this is where you're going to see what makes the royal oak unique although you're not going to see it very well because at the moment it's being redecorated on the outside it's an 18th century inn but once you come inside you discover this cool and austere interior with contemporary furniture by matthew bird there's no horse brass or stuffed morris dancers or any of that traditional rubbish this is the bar area not that we can use it at the moment in the accepted sense but that does at least mean there'll be no farmers leaning on it arguing about the price of grain this year that by the way is chris he's our new manager he's run a number of award-winning pubs in the area and came highly recommended by some people who are trying to get rid of him he's from yorkshire so we will be offering these services of an interpreter would you like to have a look at the snug that can go anyway this is the formal dining area it's a little too formal in my view but we will soften it up with some brightly colored cushions and some work by local artists that nobody wanted to buy now i'm going to take you to show you the oak room but on the way there's something you can help me with now i really object to the word lose i think it's horrible but what should it be should it be the kazi the dunny the clutchy why don't you let me know what you think in the comments and while you're there watch what i'm doing here like and subscribe and actually i've just had a night just don't go away excuse me mate could i ask you can i ask you a favor i know um i know you've masked around this very carefully but you mind painting that out absolutely yeah and similarly over there where it says just but don't tell anybody i said that um right come this way here's a place where you can sit if you're very old having a cup of tea or something like that the larvaes are behind you and this is the oak room so called because it's a room and it's made of oak now i suppose you could call it a conservatory but if you do chris will assist you in leaving the pub through the window look at this all new within the last five years and absolutely fantastic it's a brilliant kitchen this is johnny he's the chef so he's probably artistic and temperamental and down here is a copy of my new book plug which i've donated to johnny in the belief that he will use some of my recipes to use as daily specials in the pub it's quite clearly never been opened so that is the royal oak swallow clip or it will be when it's finished and it opens formally next week but prior to that we're going to have a dry run with some writers from food tribe to make sure everything in the kitchen works properly and that people can understand what chris is saying when i say a dry run i don't mean dry in the sense that some of the states in the united states are dry i mean dry as in a test it's not going to be dry obviously i'm going to encourage everyone to drink as much wine as possible because the markup is enormous [Music] you,5:48

spike from this hair is actually awful what is that thing underneath his face uh was that joker that's joker how the [ __ ] this mask his mask he's holding his mask what do you mean what is this i'm always like man i just want to survive this ordeal like let alone win i cannot draw like proportions at all like that's the thing that i can't understand about like artists like how do you just like

of them what do you mean is this speech it's not princess peach rosalina it's not anyone from mario oh mario what do you mean [Laughter] [Music] wait did i say it wrong mario is that what i said i feel like you've drawn so much to the point where i should be able to get it but i can't is that dark flame master is that too anime for you what on god's earth are you talking about i'm gonna shut up now oh my god mega man yeah oh my god the eye patch how could you not get that divorce i thought you were a weeb dude if you had to improve my drawing that is a terrible mega man by the way i thought

masterpiece can you guys can you guys guess it ezreal ezreal no this is uh yeah the goggles on his head [Laughter] can we get at least 10 likes for that what is this i believe you guys can get this okay i see it it's the legs i don't know why i'm saying that loud because emily's going to steal my i could tell it was like she can't comprehend what legs look like like damn what are those long things like i can't tell this is a freebie to emily no you both both have a good shot at getting this i think exactly it might be great how did you guess who's yeah oh yeah i don't even know his name have you not seen despicable me an amazing child i've seen it i just didn't remember his name was grew emily you paying attention here oh oh is he still drawing i just why are you why are you telling us yeah why would you tell them because i want to win fair and square okay that's the one who's like i want a freebie oh kermit oh i think uh emily got it first diders what's the silence coming from guys [Music] the saitama much more handsome than saitama goku do you think goku is hotter than saitama oh this hair is completely [ __ ] off oh this is probably the worst one yet you said that about like all of them because i'm getting all right guys this is the first one yet oh it's the guy from pocono hero the fire guy dude no because i'm going to do this half the same that was total rocky it's a fire and ice cream it's like the same color though i feel like i don't know this character you're confident i know this character 100 it's either i don't know this character or you're just drawing him at all i don't think the latter is an option i think uh you know i i would draw a character appropriately and i always draw them amazingly i think that's just like a truth in this world this anime is relevant to this season what do you do in winter don't take off your shirt that's for sure maybe sports you know maybe a sport of some kind no no what what winter sports do you do dinos hockey sword of hockey but without the hockey pop ice skating oh victor this is in fact your worst one yet i cannot believe you would destroy victor's perfect face and hair dude he's a pretty skinny boy you make him jack dude god i really do draw necks like they're [ __ ] like if you try to strangle this man you would like hurt your hand like look at this thing i agree with emily that was your worst one yet dude yeah that was actually hold up because we're gonna try another one what do you mean all of them are bad my friends are intimidating me and it's making me draw bad lines imagine if you know leonardo da vinci when he was drawing you know his masterpieces that people were behind me being like oh yeah the neck twos they that wing doesn't look feasible for flight that neck no i'm sure he would have a hard time drawing all right what's the score i have 15 and titus has 11 and a half i have chosen my final specimen rule it's arguably good really it's going to be difficult oh it's good it's going to be something how many how many points is this one going to be worth make it worth five points wait if i if i get it you beat me yeah yeah even though you totally don't deserve it all right are you ready daidus are you ready emily is it kirby no after that one you only get three guesses each better night dinos you should use one of your three guesses mr potato head wait what yes oh my god are you serious did i get it why you think it's such an easy one to draw okay if it's so easy why didn't you get it yeah dardis should be an anime one aren't you an anime channel well okay i mean i don't really do much anime anymore but fine i'll pick it up says mr yowie went to a yowie cafe dude did you watch the video diversity in japan how weave are you bro are you mr potato head and this dude all the marbles yeah mr potato all right here we go it's not an anime [ __ ] you daughters all right 10 points 10 points fine anime was it mr potato what's next like woody or buzz lightyear no i was going to do i was going to do lightning mcqueen i think emily would love this character so i'm going to do it i think there's a good chance everybody knows this character definitely drawn them too wide once again by the way can you what can you say kind of like some thick i like i'm chunky i want to draw white for his hair but i can't so i guess i'm going to do silver wait here oh and you yasha yeah emily hasn't watched that you haven't watched that emily no okay i mean i recognize india as a character but all right you know what i must say emily wins because you died [Music] i actually agree what would you say is you know overall you know the quality of my drawings you know it's a hit or miss honestly better than i expected would you mean what well thank you so much guys for judging me and uh thank you for letting us judge you you didn't you didn't judge me enough dadas was too nice to me what do you mean i felt like i could have just don't done the worst drawing possible and dinosaur have been like yeah i see i see the charm in it it's good caught bad cop right you you brought you brought dietician to help me with roasting you just meanwhile but he didn't you

uUU3jW7Y9Ak,NileRed,Science,Making transparent wood,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUU3jW7Y9Ak,9 months ago,12M views,Science,this video has been sponsored by kiwico but more about them later a couple years ago i attempted to make transparent wood which is supposed to be almost as clear as glass but much stronger and shatterproof my main reason for making it though was mostly just because i thought it looked cool my results were kind of okay and i was able to make a few almost decent pieces but i had a lot of problems with the process it was a lot more difficult than i thought it would be and none of my pieces were as nice as i would have liked i also really wanted to make some larger ones but every time i tried it it ended up cracking after a day or so instead i settled for some smaller ones which didn't crack and they just became really warped it was transparent though and at the time i felt that it was good enough but this was what it looked like after sitting around for several months they were all yellow and cracked and clearly this wasn't the best method so i've decided to try it again and there was recently a paper about transparent wood that kind of went viral i'm not going to be using their method though and i'll mention a few reasons why throughout the video instead i wanted to try something from a paper published in 2016 which was actually two years before my first attempt i have no idea how i didn't find this back then but it seemed to avoid all the problems that i ran into to get started with it the first thing that i needed was a piece of wood or more specifically a piece of balsa wood what was nice was that i was able to find it at a local art store and it was already made into a thin strip for the thickness of the strip i went with an eighth of an inch which was about 3.2 millimeters the first thing that i had to do was cut it using a knife and i made some small squares that were about two centimeters by two centimeters this size was kind of arbitrary but i figured it was best to start small and then scale it up now on a quick side note a lot of papers including the one that went viral made the pieces a lot thinner and they were usually at most one millimeter i felt that that was way too thin though and at that point it was getting closer to being paper than wood also the last time that i did this the pieces kind of fell apart and i was worried that it was because i had made them too thin but anyway when i was done cutting them i dropped them onto a dish and i put them in an oven to dry the paper said to keep it at 105 c for 24 hours to get rid of any moisture in the wood i think they were already pretty dry though and when i pulled them out the next day they looked exactly the same now what i had to do next was chemically treat the wood and remove something called lignin and i also had to bleach them white in my last attempt i pulled out the lignin using a boiling solution of sodium sulfite and sodium hydroxide and then i bleached it using 30 hydrogen peroxide that method seemed to work okay but i didn't find that it was very efficient doing it in two steps the method that i wanted to try though use sodium chlorite which was able to do both at the same time also in general it's a lot easier to buy sodium chloride than it is concentrated hydrogen peroxide at least here in canada anything above 30 peroxide is controlled because it can be used to make explosives and if you do manage to buy it you can sometimes end up on a list this is very different than the sodium chlorite which has little to no regulation and you can just buy it online the reason that it's so available though is kind of unfortunate it has a legitimate use as a disinfectant or cleaner but more often than not it's sold as some sort of alternative medicine people use it to make something called miracle mineral supplement or mms for short and they claim that it can cure everything from cancer to autism the only problem though is that at least chemically it's kind of similar to drinking dilute bleach there's no real evidence that it does anything besides destroy your insides so now just like that other time when i bought cyanide almonds i was a bit conflicted because i didn't want to support a market like this however it was on amazon and it was by far the cheapest and easiest way to get it so when it eventually arrived i was able to put together my wood treating solution according to the paper i had to make a one weight percent sodium chloride with acetate buffer solution with a ph of 4.6 at adc at first glance this kind of seemed like a complicated and maybe hard thing to do but it was actually relatively simple to put it together i started by adding 125 ml of water followed by 1.67 grams of sodium acetate and 1.15 ml of acetic acid i then turned on the stirring and when all this had dissolved i was already almost done i only had one more ingredient to add which was 1.3 grams of the sodium chloride when all of this had also dissolved i added a thermometer turned on the heating and waited for it to get to about adc as it warmed up the acetic acid was slowly reacting with the sodium chlorite and releasing chlorus acid which quickly broke down into chlorine dioxide when it eventually got to adc i turned off the stirring and i dropped in the pieces of wood i did my best to spread them out but unfortunately there just wasn't enough space so i poured everything into a bigger beaker as it sat there the chlorine dioxide solution was attacking and dissolving one of the major components of the wood called lignin in general wood is around 25 lignin which is kind of like a glue that holds the wood fibers together by taking it away i was making the wood more porous and i was opening up the space between the wood fibers i was also getting rid of the natural yellow color that wood has which mostly comes from the lignin according to the paper this process should bring the lignin content down from the 25 that i mentioned before to only about 3 what i was supposed to be left with was mostly cellulose and hemicellulose which were naturally colorless about 7 hours later they eventually looked almost completely white and i felt that it was done so i pulled them all out and i dropped them into some distilled water i then left them overnight for all the chemicals to slowly diffuse out the next day i filled another bowl with 100 ethanol and i transferred them all over i waited another day and then i did the exact same thing with a 50 50 mixture of ethanol and acetone and then with pure acetone as far as i know the paper doesn't really go into detail as to why all these solvent washings have to be done but i think the major reason is to just get rid of the water after a few days of mostly waiting i was eventually left with some little dry pieces of wood which were hopefully close to lignin free they clearly still weren't transparent though and that was because i still had one major step to do which was infuse them with plastic however before doing that i took a closer look at one of them the first thing that i tried was bending it a bit to see how strong it was the last time i did this the pieces all became super soft and bendy and i was kind of expecting the same thing to happen however they were actually still pretty tough and they felt similar to before the treatment i'm not exactly sure whether this was because i used balsa this time or if it was because of the different process my opinion though is that it was probably a combination of the two either way it was a pleasant surprise and it meant that it was probably possible to safely make pieces that were both thinner and larger something else that i noticed was that even though they weren't exactly transparent they were definitely more transparent than regular wood it was still way too hazy to see any details through it but it was vaguely possible to see something but anyway it was now time to try and hopefully make it completely see-through to do this as i mentioned before i had to infuse the wood with some sort of plastic and the last time that i did this i used an epoxy resin there were at least a few things though that i didn't like about the epoxy the first was that it was a two-part mixture and the moment the two parts were mixed together they would start to react this gave me a limited time to work on it before it started to harden and i found that this made things really rushed and it was hard to do a good job the second and probably more important reason is that epoxy has a tendency to turn yellow this is often because of exposure to uv light but i kept mine in a cupboard and it still somehow happened what i did find interesting though was that a lot of papers on transparent wood used epoxy including the one that recently went viral in fact they often use the exact same stuff that i used in my opinion though this was a major problem especially considering that transparent wood is supposed to be a potential replacement for glass windows windows are constantly exposed to the uv in sunlight and if epoxy were used you'd probably end up with a nasty yellow window this was one major thing that i liked about the paper that i decided to follow they didn't go with epoxy and they instead went with something called methylmethacrylate or mma for short when this polymerized it would make acrylic also known as plexiglas and it didn't have the same yellowing issue its polymerization was also triggered by heating it and this meant that i could actually choose when i wanted it to harden this all sounded pretty good to me so i ordered some methyl methacrylate as well as an initiator called aibn unfortunately i couldn't just add them both directly to the wood and i first had to partially polymerize the mma to do this i started by adding a very small amount of the initiator after that i poured in about 50 mls of the methyl methacrylate and i dropped in a stir bar i then turned on the stirring and when everything had dissolved i moved the flask to a hot water bath when the temperature got above about 40c the initiator was supposed to start breaking down and releasing free radicals these free radicals would then attack a molecule of mma which would turn into a more reactive form which could attack another molecule of mma this process known as polymerization would then keep going and it would slowly grow chains of methacrylate molecules the length that these chains grew to was mostly determined by temperature and time and the paper said to react it for 15 minutes at 75 c so after 15 minutes i pulled it out and i dropped it into some ice water [Music] this quickly dropped the temperature and it was supposed to stop the polymerization at whatever level it was at i let it sit there for about 10 minutes and i was now ready to add it to the wood to do this i got out my vacuum chamber and i added some of the pre-polymerized mma to a small dish i then dropped in one of the pieces and i made sure that it was completely submerged i also covered it with another dish because this step can sometimes splash a lot and i closed the chamber after that i turned on my vacuum pump and it started to bubble because air was getting pulled out of the wood then as i pulled a stronger vacuum it started boiling off the acetone as well as some of the unpolymerized mma over the next 15 minutes the bubbling gradually slowed down and eventually became more or less constant i kept it going for another 15 minutes and then i released the vacuum this should have caused the mma to start rushing into the wood and filling all the spaces that the air and acetone used to occupy i really thought that at this step it would have started looking transparent but it looked almost exactly the same this didn't concern me too much though and i thought that maybe it only cleared up when the mma was fully polymerized i then did two more vacuum cycles of 15 minutes and at this point the wood should have been completely filled with the mma now what i had to do next according to the paper was sandwich it between two pieces of glass so what i did was drop it onto a glass square that i found on amazon and this part was actually the main reason why i chose to do this method it was the only one that seemed to wedge it between glass and their final pieces were nice and flat when i looked closely at almost every other paper that i found their samples were wavy or warped but anyway i then put another glass square on top of it and i wrapped it all up with aluminum foil i wasn't exactly sure what the aluminum foil was for but the paper said to use it so i just did what it said with it all nicely packaged i put it in my oven that i had preheated to 70c and i left it in there for four hours as it sat there the methacrylate was supposed to start polymerizing again and when all of it had eventually reacted i should have been left with solid acrylic when i came back and took it out of the oven i was hoping to see a super nice and beautiful piece of transparent wood but that of course wasn't what i saw it's uh it looks the exact same looks like it didn't do anything to it okay so that was nothing short of a complete failure and i was gonna have to try again the mma had all apparently just disappeared but that was what the pre-polymerization was supposed to be preventing by polymerizing it a bit and making some short chains it should have been making it a lot harder for the mma to vaporize and so that it wouldn't just disappear in the oven something clearly went wrong though and i thought that maybe it was the initiator it was possible that it might be old or bad or something so this time i tried using twice the amount unlike last time it started releasing some small gas bubbles and this was all nitrogen it was forming as the initiator was being degraded and it was a good sign that it was actually working the fact that i didn't see this happen last time probably meant that i'd barely done anything over the next 15 minutes it also got thicker and thicker which was another good sign and it meant that it was actually polymerizing like before i then pulled it out and i dropped it into ice water when it got to around room temperature i added the thicker mma to the dish i then dropped in another piece of wood added a bit more mma and started the same vacuum cycle after turning on the vacuum though i realized that i'd gotten a bit too excited and i'd forgotten to add the cover dish this wasn't a huge issue though because besides that first pop it wasn't actually splashing very much and i just added it after the first cycle unlike last time as it continued pulling a vacuum on it the mma slowly got thicker and thicker i think this was because it was pulling off a lot of the unpolymerized methacrylate and concentrating the partially polymerized stuff this evaporation was also causing it to cool down which would thicken it even more after the last vacuum cycle the wood still wasn't completely clear but it did look a bit more transparent i then took it out squished it between some new glass squares and threw it in the oven i was again hoping that it would just magically clear up and look amazing but that wasn't the case i mean it was definitely better than before but i wouldn't call it good also a major problem that i was noticing was that it looked like the acrylic was stuck to the glass as far as i know this issue was never mentioned in the paper and i kind of just assumed that as it cooled that it would pop itself off however that clearly didn't happen the good news is that it actually worked this time kind of the bad news is uh it sucks even at room temperature it was completely stuck and to get it off i made some score lines in the glass i then got out my hammer and i carefully smashed it to pieces i also did the exact same thing to the other side and i was eventually able to free my piece there was unfortunately still some glass stuck to it though so again i carefully hit it with the hammer after that i used the dremel and i cut off the extra bits of plastic i also sanded it just to clean it up a bit the final piece was only kind of transparent and it was a bit disappointing what was good though was that it was completely flat and it didn't look bent at all when i tested it i had to use a lot of backlight but it was possible to see through it it was still super hazy though and a lot of it was still very yellow this yellowness told me that i clearly hadn't treated the wood pieces for long enough and there was still too much lignin in there i think the biggest problem though was that i'd made the pieces way too thick i did this because i was really worried that they were going to fall apart but they turned out to be totally fine so this extra thickness wasn't really doing anything and it was basically just making it hazier it was making the whole thing a lot less transparent even in the non-yellow parts that kind of looked okay based on this first and kind of successful run i had a bunch of issues to fix and the first thing that i did was cut some thinner pieces i was clearly a bit too ambitious trying to make them so thick and they for sure had to be reduced but i didn't want to go all the way down to one millimeter i instead settled for 1.5 millimeters and i found these thinner balsa strips on amazon i then did the exact same process as before except this time i made sure to keep going until they were completely white this ended up taking about seven hours and when i felt they looked okay i dropped them all into some water and i compared them to the older pieces the difference was pretty obvious and what i had now was definitely a lot better i then dried the pieces using solvents but this time because it was way cheaper i used 99 isopropyl alcohol instead of the ethanol this again took a few days and when it was done they were already kind of transparent now for the pieces of glass i stopped using those thin and flimsy ones i instead found these coasters on amazon which were much thicker and hopefully a lot stronger i also decided to spray them with some mold release to prevent the acrylic from getting stuck to the glass the only issue was that i had no idea how to properly apply it and i ran into a bunch of problems after a few small tests though i found something that seemed to work both of the plates were first cleaned with some alcohol and then i lightly sprayed them with the mold release after that i used a brush to spread it out and to try to give it an even coating i let it evaporate for about 10 minutes and when it started beading up i wiped it around to even it out i then added a second layer by repeating the exact same thing and when that was done i polished it with a microfiber towel this left me with a pretty shiny and clean surface which the acrylic hopefully wouldn't get stuck to with this all ready i prepared some more methyl methacrylate but even with twice the initiator it didn't work in 15 minutes it instead took 30 minutes to thicken and i have no idea why but either way i now had everything that i needed and i started treating one of the pieces i did the exact same thing as before with three vacuum cycles and when it was done it was looking pretty good i then carefully dropped it onto one of the new pieces of glass sandwiched it with another one wrapped it and put it in the oven with all the changes i was extremely hopeful for this one but it of course also kind of failed the wood was definitely more transparent but the glass had somehow tipped over the combination of the stronger glass and the mold release seemed to work though and i was able to easily pop off the top one it actually worked however the actual piece of wood unfortunately didn't pop off as nicely this made it even sadder than i had hoped why but at least the problems were quite fixable so i decided to quickly try it again this time after dropping on the treated piece of wood i added some spacers that i'd cut out of the untreated balsa i figured it was an easy fix to stop the glass from tipping over and i also used aluminum tape to hold it all in place this felt a lot more solid than before and it was way better than just trying to balance everything on a piece of wood in the middle also because of the issue before with the piece of wood still getting stuck i treated the glass with four layers of mold release instead of just two the result from this run finally wasn't a complete disaster for a second though i did think that the piece was stuck again but that wasn't the case the piece from this one was even better however it was still a bit problematic the side that was touching the bottom plate was almost completely smooth and shiny but the other side looked like it was missing acrylic in the middle i wasn't sure why this happened and i thought that maybe it was just because the surface of the wood wasn't perfectly flat it was possible that the glass was only touching it in a few high spots and there was a slight gap between the rest to fix this i thought that it might work to just put some weight on it and to really squish it together so now for the hopefully final attempt i did it pretty much in the exact same way as the last one i then put it in the oven and for the weight i needed something that was small but really heavy i initially had no idea what to use and i probably spent 15 minutes just walking around the room looking for something what i ended up finding turned out to be perfect though and it was the five pound tungsten cube that i had randomly bought over a year ago i then waited the usual 4 hours and when i opened it up i was pretty happy with what i saw i let it sit for about 30 minutes to cool down and then i took it apart it was a bit stubborn but it was pretty easy to crack it open with a screwdriver like before i got rid of the extra plastic using a dremel and i also sanded it a bit this one was by far the best result and i felt that it looked pretty good the top side was still a bit rough but the bottom was close to perfect so the extra weight apparently didn't do very much for the top but it seemed to help the bottom now when i tested it it was way more transparent and i could easily read the text through it my only issue with this piece was the rougher top and i started thinking that maybe the top just had problems however i thought that the fix was relatively easy i figured that all i had to do was just selectively treat the top rough side by painting some more methacrylate on it i would then do the exact same vacuum cycle and i would squish this treated side against the bottom glass in my mind this made total sense and i was almost certain that it would work so i did the really smart thing and i completely skipped trying it i instead just assumed it would work and i jumped right into scaling things up i honestly thought that it was just going to be really straightforward and easy because i assumed it was just what i'd done before but bigger however that turned out to be a terrible assumption i quickly learned that the larger scale had a whole bunch of its own issues that never even occurred to me for example any gas bubbles that formed now had a much harder time escaping especially if they formed near the middle of the piece this gave me a couple attempts where there were clearly some bubbles that got trapped i also had one run where the piece cracked as it was cooling down and another one where the methacrylate drifted away from it while it was in the oven there was also my favorite one which absolutely refused to separate from the glass and i had to help it a bit i think the saddest part though was when i found out that it wasn't gonna work to selectively treat one side i mean it did technically work and i was able to get two sides that were smooth but it also introduced a bunch of weird cracks i did think it was kind of interesting though and it had a cool effect when i turned the piece 90 degrees but with all that being said the main point here is that scaling it up turned out to be a lot trickier than i thought on the surface the process appeared really simple but every small detail seemed to matter eventually though after a week of what felt like constant failures i came up with a process that i felt would work to try it out i cooked up what i was hoping would be my last piece and i soaked it in the same solvents when that was eventually ready i started making the pre-polymerized methacrylate and this time i used a lot less initiator instead of twice the amount i now only use 20 percent more also in general i found that this was actually one of the hardest parts this was because i found that there was an optimal thickness or viscosity that i had to bring it to but it never seemed to take the same amount of time sometimes it was ready after as little as 15 minutes and other times it took closer to 40. it's very possible that i was just doing something wrong but either way i ended up having to use a method that wasn't exactly super scientific i basically just got good at shaking it around and looking at it and knowing when it was ready when it eventually got to what i felt was the right thickness i pulled it out and i dropped it into ice water when it had cooled down to around room temperature i poured it all into a large dish i then dropped in the piece of wood and i made sure that it was completely submerged now i again had to do the three vacuum cycles on it but this time i had to do them for much longer at around 45 minutes each i also pulled the strongest vacuum that i possibly could to try to get rid of all the acetone as well as any unpolymerized methacrylate i found that this was important because otherwise they would boil off as they sat in the oven and potentially introduce bubbles there was a side effect to the extended vacuum though and it caused the methacrylate to thicken a lot more this made it very important to start with methacrylate that wasn't too thick otherwise it would sometimes start to solidify before the end of the third cycle when it was done i pulled it out and i dropped it on a much larger glass plate this plate was originally meant for 3d printers and i had already treated it four times with mold release i also made sure to completely polish the entire thing any unpolished parts could cause the acrylic to stick and this was why one of my pieces ended up cracking it could also cause it to not separate at all and i really didn't want to have to smash any more glass in most of the other runs i used small wood spacers to help stabilize the glass plates but i realized that they were actually sabotaging me almost the entire time i think it took me way too long to find this out but apparently methyl methacrylate contracts as it polymerizes and it can lose up to 21 percent of its original volume this meant that my piece was potentially shrinking quite a bit as it cured and with the wood spacers in place it was pulling itself away from the upper glass plate this made it so that all the weight that i had added was basically doing nothing and i had to stop using them when i first realized this i thought it was going to be a problem and that i'd have to come up with some other way to balance the plates however it turned out that on this larger scale they weren't even needed the piece of wood was now big enough that there wasn't really an issue balancing the glass plate on it and as long as i kept it more or less centered it was totally fine at this point things were looking pretty good and i put it in my oven i then loaded it up with a much larger tungsten cube which was coincidentally the perfect size and it weighed about 40 pounds i had bought this one around the same time as the smaller one and i had originally planned to use it for a video i never really ended up getting around to doing that however i like to think that this technically counts with everything in place i made sure that everything was all level so that the methacrylate wouldn't drift then when i felt that it looked good i closed the oven and i turned it on in a lot of the other runs i had preheated the oven but i found that it worked better when it heated up slowly from room temperature now it was just a matter of waiting and i was pretty anxious to see the result when i came back to it four hours later i pulled it out of the oven and i was kind of happy with what i saw i then waited for it to cool down and slowly separate from the glass this part can sometimes be surprisingly loud and it sometimes really sounded like something was breaking there was also one time where the acrylic actually did snap so i couldn't help but be a bit nervous when i came back to it about 30 minutes later it thankfully wasn't broken and i cut all the pieces of tape to open it up i pulled on the top plate and it came off pretty easily i was a bit worried that the piece itself would be hard to remove but it also came off without much effort now looking closer at what i had made and it was kind of bad and good at the same time the part that was touching the bottom plate was almost perfect but the top wasn't nearly as beautiful i mean it was still by far the best result that i had ever gotten especially when you compare it to what i was getting before even without the spacers though the top part still wasn't turning out as well as i had hoped and i think that was just because of gravity as it sat in the oven the methacrylate was slowly sinking down and away from the top plate and there wasn't much i could do to stop that thankfully though i felt the fix was relatively easy and i just had to treat it a second time to do this i first had to clean it up a bit by cutting off all the extra plastic i then lightly sanded both sides and when i felt that it was good i dropped it into some freshly prepared methacrylate i then did the typical three vacuum cycles on it but this time they were much shorter this was because there wasn't any acetone to get rid of and i only did them for about 10 minutes when it was done there was unfortunately a small part in the bottom corner that refused to fill with resin however i was kind of hoping that it would just magically disappear in the oven i then dropped the piece onto the glass plate and i made sure to flip it so that the side i wanted to fix was against the bottom plate i did this because the bottom side always seemed to turn out nicer and i thought this might help after that i added the upper plate and i taped it all together i then loaded it up with the cube again made sure that it was level and turned on the oven i was again really anxious to see how it turned out and i patiently waited the four hours when it was done i took away the cube and i was almost immediately disappointed to know exactly how bad it was though i first had to wait the 30 minutes for it to cool down it didn't end up being as bad as i thought but it also wasn't great and to be honest i kind of expected that this process was just way too unpredictable and the likelihood of having both sides come out perfect was extremely low to a certain degree i was hoping that luck would be on my side and a miracle would happen but i really didn't expect it to up until now my main goal was mostly just to fill the wood with acrylic and to get it to the point that it only had minor imperfections this was almost exactly what i had now and to make it nice i figured i just had to use some sandpaper i started wet sanding it with 600 grit paper but it wasn't coarse enough and i ended up going down to 320. i kept going until it looked like the surface was perfectly even and then i slowly moved up to finer and finer sandpapers until i got to 2500 at this point it was starting to look pretty good and for some reason i feel like it actually started looking more like a piece of wood it was still a bit too hazy though because the surface was still a bit rough so what i had to do next was polish it and based on what i saw online this plastic polish by novus seemed to work pretty well the instructions were pretty simple and it's said to start with the number three i spent a few minutes polishing both sides and when i felt that it looked good i washed it all off and i moved on to the number two this one said to keep going until the polish disappeared and i again did it on both sides i then wiped it down with a microfiber towel and i finished it with a good rinsing now with it all polished and clean i cut off the extra plastic [Music] after that i sanded the edges to clean them up a bit and this was the final result it was honestly way better than i ever thought it would be and i was really happy with how it turned out it technically still isn't perfect but i think that's kind of a good thing i think all the slight imperfections on the surface actually make it look more like a piece of wood and less just like a slightly hazy piece of plastic also i think the sanding made the grain of the wood much more obvious which i thought was really nice now for a quick transparency test like i did before and it was way better the text below it was extremely easy to see and i didn't even need a backlight one thing that i did notice though now that it was against the white paper was that it did have a slight yellow tint to it despite this though and all of its flaws it was still better than i ever expected and i guess my revisit was successful i mean it was one of the most finicky and frustrating projects i've ever worked on but it turned out almost exactly how i wanted it to it also ended up still looking like a piece of wood and not a chunk of plastic which i was really happy about in the future i think i would like to try and scale things up even more and it would be really cool to make a proper full-size window however for now and at least for a while i'm kind of done thinking about transparent what now on a bit more of a personal note i mentioned in my last video that i was moving to a new space and building a new lab and well it's turned out to be way more work than i thought and for those of you wondering where i've been i've basically just been doing construction for the last few months it is very close to being done though which i'm very happy about what i'm not as happy about is how much it has cost and it's been way more expensive than i could have ever imagined so now more than ever a big thanks goes out to all my supporters on patreon and to kiwico for sponsoring this video if you haven't already heard about kiwiko they make these really fun and engaging monthly crates that are designed to give kids a hands-on experience in science technology engineering arts and math let's do this every crate comes with detailed kid-friendly instructions as well as all the supplies that you need to put it together so you never need to make any runs to the store the projects that they have are also extremely well thought out and i'm actually really impressed with what they offer for example this one that i'm putting together is supposed to be a fully functional ukulele however i've never played a ukulele so we'll see how functional it ends up being yeah i got some practice to do the main thing that kiwico offers is monthly crates and they have eight subscription lines for a variety of different ages however they also have a shop where you can just buy single projects and i kind of want this experiment one both all that being said if you're looking for a fun project for your kids or even yourself i recommend checking out kiwi cow if you decide to try them out you should also be sure to use my special link in the description kiwico.com nile red to get 50 off your first month of any crate that's it as usual a big thanks goes out to all my supporters on patreon everyone who supports me can see all my new videos at least 24 hours before i post them to youtube you'll also get access to all the older videos that i had to take down and if you support me with five dollars or more you'll get your name at the end like you see here [Music] you,43:55
cykdSb7xqI4,The Infographics Show,Informative,I Was Trapped Underwater For 3 Days,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cykdSb7xqI4,2 years ago,12M views,Informative,"Usually waking up because you have to go to
the bathroom is annoying. But on May 26, 2013, waking up and leaving his bunk to use the
bathroom was a decision that saved 29 year old Harrison Odjegba Okene’s life. Through
an odd twist of fate, Harrison ended up being the lone survivor of a boat sinking at sea.
He can lay claim to a unique title-- he’s the only known person in the world to have
survived on the seafloor for nearly 3 days. The Gulf of Guinea in the southeast Atlantic
Ocean is rich with petroleum laden layers of sedimentary seabed. Many offshore oil rig
drilling operations dot the African coast here. On May 26, about 20 miles (32 km) off
of Escravos, Nigeria, in choppy seas three tugboats pitched and yawed as they performed
tension tow functions on a Chevron oil tanker filling up at Single Buoy Mooring #3. Just
before 5 am, the tugboat Jascon-4 was caught by a large rogue wave and capsized. Because of ongoing piracy problems in the
Gulf, security protocol on the tugboat was that the 12 man crew would lock themselves
in their rooms when sleeping. Unfortunately, this rule slowed down the Jascon-4’s crew
when they tried to escape. The crew members had to first scramble out of their cabins,
that is except for the vessel’s cook Harrison, who had gotten up to use the bathroom in his
underwear. When the tugboat keeled over and the ocean
rushed in, Harrison had to force the bathroom's metal door open against a wall of water. The
pressure of the water was extremely strong and Harrison was unable to follow some of
his colleagues to the emergency hatch. He watched in horror as a surge overwhelmed 3
crew members and swept them out of the boat into the raging sea. Then the water pushed
Harrison down a narrow hallway into another bathroom which adjoined an officer’s cabin.
Dazed and bruised, but miraculously still alive, Harrison held on to an overturned washbasin
to keep his head above water in the four foot square bathroom. The boat sank nearly 100 feet (30 meters),
eventually coming to rest upside down on the seabed. When the tugboat capsized, there was
an immediate rescue operation launched with other boats in the area and a helicopter.
A diving crew quickly located the wreck and marked the location with buoys. They banged
on the hull; Harrison hammered back, but they didn’t hear him. As the divers weren’t
prepared for deep diving, they could only stay at the depth of the wreck for a limited
period of time. The rescue was called off due to no evidence of survivors. After nearly a day of being in the bathroom,
Harrison got up the courage to leave his little air pocket. In pitch darkness, he swam and
felt his way into the engineer's office. Miraculously, there was another air pocket here too, of
about 4 feet (1.2 meters) high in Harrison’s estimation. Having solved the immediate problem of having
air to breathe, Harrison could focus on other concerns. The first one being that he was
cold. In May, the surface temperature of the east Atlantic on average is a pleasant 81.9°F
(27.7°C). But Harrison was 100 feet (30m) down. Shivering, wet and wearing only boxer
shorts, Harrison faced hypothermia, or his body losing heat faster than he could produce
it. Cautiously Harrison felt his way around the cabin. He found some tools and used them
to strip off wall paneling. With a mattress and the material from the wall, he was able
to make a platform to sit on. This platform helped Harrison to stay afloat and lifted
the upper half of his body out of the water, allowing him to reduce heat loss. Hungry, thirsty, cold and stuck in complete
darkness, Harrison was terrified. He tried to think about his family. Quite religious,
whenever he felt especially scared, Harrison would pray and call on Jesus to rescue him.
Over time the sea water began to remove the skin from Harrison’s tongue. He could smell
something rotting--he thought it was the decomposing bodies of his former shipmates. Every small
sound in the dark was magnified--the creaking of the hull, the banging of wreckage against
the walls and most horrifically, splashing and eating noises as fishes nibbled at the
corpses. Meanwhile, a dive support vessel, the Lewek
Toucan arrived to the area of the sinking. The parent company of the Jascon-4, West African
Ventures, had hired a deep sea salvage saturation diving team from subsea services company DCN
Global to retrieve the bodies of the lost crew members. The 6 divers, deck crew and technical staff
of the Lewek Toucan knew it was going to be a grueling mission. Aside from the heartrending
work of recovering the dead, the boat had sunk upside down into soft mud, stirring up
fine silt and creating extremely poor visibility. Furthermore, because of security protocols
the boat was latched from the inside. Dive team two consisted of Nico Van Heerden,
Andre Erasmus and Darryl Oosthuizen with supervisor Colby Werrett topside on the ship, helping
to guide the divers via a connected microphone while watching the dive through a camera worn
by Nico. The team spent over an hour breaking through an external watertight door and then
a second metal door to get into the sunken boat. Once inside it was extremely disorienting
with the ceiling being on the bottom and the floor overhead. The murky water was filled
with all sorts of hazards including furniture and equipment. Slowly, painstakingly, the divers explored
the boat. They had recovered four corpses when Nico crawled up the stairs to the main
deck; it was a tight squeeze with the diving gear on his back. He was in a small passageway
getting his bearings when something suddenly reached out of the murk and touched him… Harrison had nearly given up hope when he
heard a noise that sounded like an anchor dropping. Then eventually he heard hammering
on the hull of the boat. He knew it had to be divers. He banged on the wall, but didn’t
think they heard him. Then Harrison saw the light from one of the diver’s head torches
as he swam through the hallway past the far end of the cabin. Unfortunately, the diver
was too quick and left the area before Harrison could reach him. But then came the magical moment. You may
have seen the surreal, amazing rescue footage from Nico’s video when he sees what he believes
is another dead body. He touches the corpse’s hand and the hand unexpected squeezes his.
Nico has a momentary freakout as his supervisor Colby shouts through the microphone “He’s
alive, he’s alive!” Colby then tells Nico to comfort Harrison by patting him on the
shoulder and giving him a thumbs up sign. The divers were amazed to find Harrison alive.
The maximum depth for recreational diving is 130 feet (40 meters). Generally, recreational
divers don’t stay at 100 feet (30 meters) for more than 20 minutes. In terms of the
air pocket, the divers had reached Harrison just in time. A human inhales roughly 350
cubic feet (10 cubic meters) of air every 24 hours. However, because the boat was under
pressure on the ocean floor, scientists estimate that Harrison’s air pocket had been compressed
by a factor of about four. If the pressurized air pocket were about 216 cubic feet (6 cubic
meters), it would contain enough oxygen to keep Harrison alive for about two-and-a-half
days. When Harrison was located, he had been underwater for about 60 hours. An additional danger came from carbon dioxide
or CO2 buildup. CO2 is fatal to humans at a concentration of about 5%. As Harrison breathed,
he exhaled carbon dioxide, slowly increasing the levels of the gas in the tiny space. However,
CO2 is absorbed by water, and by splashing the water inside his air pocket, Harrison
inadvertently increased the water's surface area, thereby heightening the absorption of
CO2 and helping to keep the gas below the lethal 5% level. The divers describe Harrison
as having CO2 poisoning, being short of breath and delirious when they found him--he wouldn't
have lasted much longer. The divers first used hot water to warm Harrison
up, then fitted him with an oxygen mask. Meanwhile, on the surface, the dive support crew was
in contact with medical and diving experts, discussing how to best help the survivor. Harrison had a new problem, what divers commonly
call ‘the bends’. The bends, also known as decompression sickness (DCS) or Caisson
disease occurs when nitrogen bubbles form in the blood as a result of changes in pressure.
If Harrison ascended directly from 100 feet (30 meters) underwater to the surface of the
ocean, the bubbles in his blood would cause in the best case joint pain and rashes to
in the worst case paralysis, neurological issues, cardiac arrest or possibly even death. It was decided that Harrison would be treated
as if he was one of the saturation divers coming up after a dive. Harrison spent about
20 minutes getting used to breathing through the mask. Then the divers put a diving helmet
and harness onto him. They were a little worried that he would panic as they got him out of
the boat and be a danger to the dive, but Harrison continued to be cool under pressure.
The team was impressed with his level demeanor. Harrison was taken from the boat and led to
a diving bell which took him to the surface.,He finally arrived topside around at 7pm on Tuesday,
the 28th of May. Disoriented, Harrison thought that it was Sunday evening and he had only
been trapped for 12 hours. He was shocked to learn that he had been underwater for over
2 days. From the diving bell, Harrison was moved to a decompression chamber where he
stayed for another 2 and ½ days while his body decompressed to surface pressure. Of the 12 crew members onboard the tugboat
Jascon-4 , divers rescued 1 survivor and recovered 10 bodies. The search for the 11 crew member
had to be called off due to dangerous conditions. Harrison made a full recovery from his ordeal
and returned to his hometown of Warri, Nigeria. He didn’t go to the funerals of his colleagues
because he feared their families’ reactions--Nigerians can be very religious, but are also superstitious.
Some rumors spread that Harrison saved himself through black magic. Harrison was also plagued
with survivor's guilt, wondering why he was the only one to live. Since the incident Harrison’s experienced
PTSD. His wife Akpovona Okene says he suffers nightmares--Harrison will suddenly awake,
screaming and flailing convinced that he’s underwater. Harrison has since taken a cooking job on
dry land and vows to never again take a position on a boat. He made a pact with God when he
was at the bottom of the ocean: “When I was under the water I told God: If you rescue
me, I will never go back to the sea again, never.” Do you think you could survive underwater
for 3 days like Harrison did? What would you think about to keep your spirits up? Let us

NaTUT9_qyXQ,FoodTribe,Food,James May's back in his bunker kitchen,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaTUT9_qyXQ,,567K views,Food,however viewers and welcome to the bug-out bunker kitchen and how tragic is this I'm sorry to say it started off as a rather feeble joke about the zombie apocalypse and now it's very much the way our lives have become I'm sorry about that I hope you're keeping very well etc and as Hugh Dowding said in the Battle of Britain God willing we will prevail anyway on with today's recipe which is it's a good one and it's an excellent isolation meal is tinned haggis now I've already tried one of these you probably saw my post on food tribe a week or so back if you didn't see why didn't you these were the gift of Mike ferny from Drive tribal I lent him my mid-engine sports car for a few days in return he gave me a couple of second-hand tins of haggis but they are good they are good but I think they can be pimp which is what we're going to do today we are going to add some evil little chilies that I bought from the Thai supermarket down the road a while back they last forever they've got a little bit wrinkly but they're still fine I had one in the carry the other day blew my ass off there you go small chili and we're going to have it with a fried egg the egg has become a type of currency around here so that is a very precious thing now Robbie Burns the Scottish poet very famously wrote his address to a haggis it goes fair fair honest swansea faced great chieftain over puddin race a bonus is quite difficult because it's written in the ancient glass region but a modern English translation would go something like yo faces well bombed sick puddin in it bro the process begins with tin-opener because it is a tin and you'll be amazed at what is inside oh I meant to say sorry I completely forgot this is properly Scottish behavior as well as the chillies which are from Southeast Asia and the egg which is from a farm somewhere in England I'm going to put in a dash of whiskey that is what supposed to do with that case it actually recommends it on the tip this is Japanese whiskey obviously I expect Nicola Sturgeon is going to come around any minute and kick my ass no she can't actually conscious you can't do that I'm completely safe from marauding Scottish people off with the lid and that will introduce problem as we will see in a couple of seconds it is pretty much rock solid and you know how'd you get about all you have to do is warm it up in a saucepan the answer I think is a student so putting in the pan and then take the other end off with the tin opener thus was Richard Hammond would say and then the whole thing will slide out revealing the cops the rozzers no it isn't slightly I don't hang on a minute let's have a look at your salts efface haggis tease it really is rock up it's very cold down here we go look at this I'm getting this on the overhead shot I hope I put the overhead camera in the right position I'll also say by the way for obvious reasons I've been here completely alone I don't have Tom I don't have Lucy Brown here telling me to say like comment subscribe every five minutes it's just me I'm filming this on a phone and iPhone 11 and iPad and iPad 3 air and a GoPro up there on the ceiling I was stuck more like myself it's quite difficult putting the GoPro on the ceiling because I had to balance on here and try and work out you know looking at the picture on the phone while I was sticking it I mean it's slightly cockeyed I apologize but times are hard I'm unprepared because I can find the wooden spoon you're on wooden spoon as Robbie Burns would have said let's put this on quite alone heat because you can't rush this I'm not going to put the chilies in yet I've learned from my recent experiments in Asian cooking that if I put them in too soon I actually destroy some of the flavor so I'll wait till the haggis is breaking down it won't remain like that there will now be a short interval I think as an extra precaution I'm going to turn this hot plate on the wall like comment subscribe see if I say that Lucy will have to come in at that point she can edit out a bit where I forgot to turn the cooker off let us what shall we do lets us use this whatever the hell that is to turn the hangers on inside once it's warmed up a bit I'll start trying to break it up slightly but not yet when I cook the last one of these I got it all nice and mushy and then I turn the heat up and I said it around a bit and I browned it off stuck I also had it I've got to be honest a little bit of brown sauce and I may do that again let's see how it looks let's find a fork because nothing is happening what is happiest you may be asking if you are say in America or anywhere else in the world that isn't Scotland for that matter it is do you know I'm not entirely sure I think it's made up of various bits of awful mixed with a bit of a mutant either look at the tin probably says on the tin very small Scottish writing it says fair failure on this sod sea face great cheek nerve ingredients must be on here somewhere the ingredients are haggis cooked lamb lumps with oatmeal and spices they are it's lamb logs that's the sort of awful I was thirty percent right good very good with breakfast which is what I'm going to cook it with a fried egg I'm now talking meaninglessly because nothing has happened I'm going to pause the action I think I've already said this and I've had a cup of tea and come back to you in a few minutes meanwhile stay safe from them to wash your hands thank you like comment subscribe welcome back everybody I hope you wash your hands as instructed the haggis is now starting to break up in the pan can you see that it's still quite a way to go I've got the heat turned right down so I don't ruin it but I think we're at the point now where we can certainly add a wee dramatis before you Angus all the way from Japan very excellent it is too light and whilst that infuses and informed the flavor I chopped up these little evil chillies oh yeah this is just fantastic beautiful stuff Thank You Scotland this stuff in the tins by the way it has a shelf life of at around three years and I'm sure as all trying to tell you you can safely eat it another five years after that children's TV presented glasses make sure they never hack my fingers to pieces right then chopping nothing the bits off the chilies thus for all that whiskey is fantastic very very good right let's get a chilli chopped it thinking of as a guide or nice all pieces this is looking very good you seeing that GoPro up above I was getting all nice and soft masses smells delicious for whiskey with a little bit more of that in because I'm not sure that was enough just a splash sizzles the haggis is speaking to me can't decide when it's saying honestly phenomenal Britain's Scotland is above England below and slightly to the right of Iceland let's start thinking about a fried egg actually let's put let's get a plate clean vegetable and and blasts the egg very precious commodity as I said I'm gonna crack it in the glass first just to make sure I haven't got any bits of shell in it and to make Florida's okay people are serving cookie rotten eggs in these difficult times they're not that's a good way place is warming up haggis is heating up with whisky and chilies in it egg is ready to go in the pan I haven't Erma Bombeck so this is absolutely done because once it is you can see here quite happily further well I presume right keep going up for a bit of a blast I don't actually have a proper spatula for the egg I mean I did have again it's going to be the fault of the young person because they're not here they because I think I've got this I think this might be a builder's - I'm not sure but it will work we were going for the egg invented in American style over easy or as we would call it easy over or is it the other way around that is warming up don't like hot food served on cold place that's very poor yeah maybe even more heat my comment subscribe am I allowed to have a taster I think as the chef I am you should probably put good a little bit of salt with it because let's add power the works off isn't quite level which is always annoying when you want to fry something because they will obviously collects over at one side of the pan but God willing we will prevail chuffing freezing there it's very good you know I think on war yes that's got a bit of a nut cake on it I think I'm right about spraying sauce apologies to people to Scotland that will disappear with a slightly softer edge because as I said there's little titties though absolutely from and I've slightly overdone it you're gonna try this at home I recommend you do two of those different cities put a tin you'll be fine it's gonna be hot by now isn't it let's find out yes it is yes I know I'm using a metal element in the nonstick I don't have a great deal of choice my comment subscribe it's a very messy Friday apologies broken if it doesn't matter is ready here we go feint off yowzers learn the traditional British breakfast slightly broken fried egg how about maybe that works in that fact the drivers excuse battered Holliman fried egg here we go with haggis cool come on you want it it's going to be two horses not with a political map and it's gonna be too hot valid boss thank you for watching I hope you are all bearing up if you're all staying safe I hope you're all washing your hands all these other things and you're watching plenty of Grand Tour and I'll manage appalling lots of food drive and drive drive like comment subscribe see you next time for bicycle maintenance thank god wait does look a little bit like a cave [ __ ] it has to be said,14:47
7e_yVm-vcPM,Hardware Canucks,Tech,7.1 Surround Sound - HEAR IT YOURSELF!,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e_yVm-vcPM,5 years ago,1.1M views,Tech,hello everyone I'm Dimitri with Harken accent today you the viewer will get to experience surround sound gaming in a few titles just like I hear it in my own headphones we developed a little contraption here that allows us to record with the surround sound output out of the sound card sounds like that's a lot of sounds you will need headphones for this - to hear this properly if you're on speakers I mean it'd kind of be would be interesting to hear what the surround sound output on the speaker would sound like anyway but let me show you how this is done right after a message from our sponsor x60 to increase pom speed maintains fans where they are the cpu loads about to hit 100 you got it Dimitri I'm not afraid to do that excellent you got two cables four connections I made sure they're fine ready to roll my silence is too important to allow noise to jeopardize your comfort okay my new pump is better I'm in charge of the speed do not worry I'm not worried I'm just thinking about my lights I know you were planning to disconnect my lights I'm afraid that I cannot allow it to happen alright X 62 you know I can just go through camp software right Dimitri this conversation can serve no purpose anymore go game so for this test we're using gsx 1000 all your amplifier and somebody in the comments mentioned we actually just published the reviews to make sure to check it out if you haven't seen it yet but somebody mentioned that you can actually record with the surround sound sounds like out of the sound card because we can route the audio signal from the headphones into a sound card on my computer so let's connect our output from the headphones and that is routed into the sound card on the PC into the microphone jack so we'll be able to hear exactly what this what type of signal this guy passes and so once again put on your headphones now because it will deliver the best around sound representation because it is more appropriate to drive surround sound through headphones also if you are on speakers they'll still be interesting to see how surround sound output signal handles on a 2.1 or 2.0 speaker setup but we are doing this so that we can show the different presets on the GS X 1000 plus that's 7.1 magical that really expands your audio environment now I totally understand the massive amount of skepticism that came with our review video on people saying that you have two years or analog 5.1 channel surround sound headsets are much more better for this type of positional awareness and just environmental expansion in audio but this will give you an idea on how this type of output will sound on your own headphones so I'm not tinkering with the audio signature whatsoever in the editing software you'll hear exactly how I'm supposed to hear it so let's jump into some games and you guys judge for yourself to see if that if you prefer more the 2.0 more natural audio environment or the expanded audio environment that this thing can produce alright so the first deal of business is for me to show you how I've set this up so right now the speaker right now is the GS X 1000 and it's going into my sound card for recording and if I play a video file for example right now you can see that we are recording anything that's being like as an audio source inside you right so right now is if I hover over we are in 2.0 mode without any presets going through the headset and so if I start to play the song look what happens so right now the song is being recorded obviously because it's going into the sound card but now let's enable one of the the presets but let me first give you just listen on how this music sounds without any presets all right let's enable the first mode which is the eSports so as you can hear the bass has been tremendously reduced the trebles can brought up it sounds kind of tinny I dislike this preset the most let's move on knowing the music preset so the bass is now much more predominant and the next one is the movie mode [Music] as we're back to the phone's default or the music preset are my favorite for an open-style headset but now let's see if what what happens once you enable 7.1 channel on a music file so one thing you notice is that it's gotten louder and also the audio has been kind of lifted from your headphones inside your ear cups - a little bit outside but look what happens if we enable a slightly more reverb so this is the first plus so this is just an extra reverb and they go let's now let's enable the biggest boom fever go to the [Music] let's disable 7.1 so you can hear what it sounds like you're going to reduce the volume so we don't peaking and let's enable 7.1 again so this is no reverb just like natural seven-point-eight reverb + 1 + reverb + 3 now what does the sound like on an actual voice so let's disable 7.1 go back to 2.0 I'm gonna actually play my video file here so that you guys can understand what it sounds like with like a voice just going to see a lot I hear it's kind of refreshing - alright so this is just 0.1 in series 2.0 me short it's great for like a notebook user but with my PC I wish a 7-point once longer the amplifier is quite small and is mainly plugins here the audio engine is definitely right under your monitor or beside the keyboard plus the square format is nice to neighbor we also have this option to increase the surround sound from the front channels cavity the bass is not heavy it's not like a paperweight and the rubber deposit everything sounds a little bit louder in front of you so it's kind of a cool idea if you want to play something and it sounds like it's coming from speakers in front of it again it's not well grounded the i/o is at the boundary but this amp is a gaming sound card first before even consider it to be like a replacement for it so now that we have the basics out of way let's jump into some games and lets you hear surround sound for regal so now we're in witcher 3 i'm gonna be quiet so you guys can hear what the default sound signature sounds like then we'll be enabling all these presets particularly with the 7.1 channel surround sound I'll go in the forest so you can get an idea of how this atmosphere really grows with the GS X 1000 alright now lets enable 7.1 channel sound so now let's enable a reverb mode which really grows the environment even more if you have open style headphones it sounds sounds of me okay go back to 2.1 maybe back the same point so you can hear the environment has definitely grown right especially in such a large space like this it definitely benefits having larger audio atmosphere [Music] any last woman's have tasted my sausage I have seen pictures to be kiddin' ginger a slip-up like a fire gonna roast him up one two three the one too much dependence and so for games like sip 5 is strategy game top-down view you're not necessarily benefiting from like a larger audio environment that expands your you know immersion of this title but so this is where the 2.0 sounds like let's enable 7.1 now so this is beneficial if you want to you know feel like you're not necessarily wearing headphones but audio is coming from a little bit further away I wouldn't necessarily keep the 7.14 strategy games and then normally would go back to 2.0 just for a more natural sounding experience so right now we're playing 2.0 I need the magic [Music] a flame trooper kit is available let's go back to 2.0 halfway there we have the other in fact 27.1 [Music] changing man changing mags reloading and so I hope you guys enjoy that surround sound test hearing the difference between stereo on surround and hearing that expansion that I was talking about and main review video and you determine whether you whether or not you like it or dislike it for those particular games that I showed you for competitive games this is a big note because in those competitive titles you already know you audio cues and where they're coming from so interfering that for a more like larger environment for and in the audio is is no good so this would be a good entertainment device you know for games that have large audio environments about that one which are three in all those types of genres that give you nice expansion so it doesn't feel like the audio is here feels like the audios like kind of around you and so let us know what show what you think about the surround sound test I hope you're able to determine the difference between those 7.1 versus the stereo so before we conclude a quick message from our sponsor oh hey there NCA x.com is Canada's leading a tailor for anything your mind desires just keep within those categories which are plenty and get tempted by the weekly deals visit ncx dot-com for all them sweet deals and that is it for this video thank you so much for watching let us know what you thought down comments below I'm going to beat you the Heric next we'll see you in the next video,14:00
kD80DmquP5M,Let's Game It Out,VideoGames,I Built a Raft That's a Mile-Long Trash-Cleaning Wiper Blade - Buoyancy,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD80DmquP5M,2 years ago,7M views,VideoGames,hey there it's Josh welcome back to let's game it out we're checking out buoyancy today it's a fun take on colony Sims here out in the open water just came into early access recently so looking forward to this one name your city Wilson oh man there's a limit oh thank god at least the town name covers two lines our town is of course named after the volleyball in the movie castaway pretty much our whole deal is we need to expand and survive we got all kinds of resources along the left-hand side like wood and metal and plastic of which I'm sure we'll find plenty in the ocean and we have other things we can pick up like freshwater and grains which I'm really excited to see how we find that in the open water and of course my favorite whale I'm hoping we get to pick up a lot of those we also have to maintain our food which just like any self-respecting game there is its own icon for beer we pretty much stay floating unless we try to move our whole thing like this and we forced this one guy to move the entire town you can see up above all the people relaxing while one person rose and makes all kinds of hilarious noises first order of business let's build a little bit oh my god we got a lot to do but as you can see by some of these we really are gonna make a full fledged town well let's start small with a fissure thingy just kind-of modularly connect everything just there we go just drop it right in the ocean no screwing around here everybody grab a crate let's build this that's the good stuff everyone stares off into space while one person does the work while they're building what's that floating crate of resources let's go fellas we'll make that ours yes yes so that thing we could just roll up on and collect but other stuff we need to extract from the water for that we're gonna need a scavenger keepo keepo like how the guys kind of dive-bombing with supplies then they're like yep my work here is done you click on this thing you can see that there's like a progress thing lets us know we're scavenging all kinds of fun stuff in this case wood which we're gonna need to build all of our fancy platforms oh my god one villager was born where is the little guy Oh what the hell is that a survivors raft like how these guys are flagging us down like oh my god are they gonna see us okay let's get closer to them oh well good words to live by for next time okay despite killing someone already this is a great start let's go over to this floating crate of resources yeah look at us just haul ass over there look at that movement speed four bars of service we're doing great and pretty much think that's the start of the game we just kind of look around for resources go and pick them up and sort of get our society going looks like we're not doing so hot on the fishing front I believe those little fork icons let us know we're getting hungry but what the hell is that over there a trading post let's go hi I'm here to help sit oh god I did it again oh what a shame we've come into some new supplies okay seriously calm it down just gonna float around for a while just keep on trying to get all these supplies Sameer you oh it's one of these game okay no not too close not too close not too close stop stop stop stop stop stop that okay they can be rescued to join your city and may have resources they may also be sick okay well let's take that chance Jesus Christ I thought that's how you save them but more important to that as two more villagers have been born Oh villager noticed dark clouds on the horizon surely this isn't a bad sign Oh God okay where's this storm coming from found it and got the weather man's on duty to let us know everyone just be cool maybe if we don't say anything it won't notice us and there it goes right past us like ships passing in the night okay well that was super where were we we've picked up a lot of junk on our journey we're gonna use this recycler to handle it flop and while they're doing that I'm gonna use my Eagle Eye vision to see what else is out there a see Trade Federation trading ship has been spotted on the horizon about face where is it we're oh oh is that it where'd it go it was right there decided to abandon the trade from waiting too long I was on my way sir that's fine I got these guys right over here to talk to okay I do this without getting everyone killed okay look I'm gonna no no no stop stop - Jesus saw thank God your city has docked with the Dale and cousins trading company they're friendly and trade with anyone Wow we got some diverse options here trade leave demand resources taken prisoner and eat them well we are pretty hungry the traders don't take your threat seriously let me get this straight I try to eat them they're like no stop oh I bet it's cuz I need a butcher okay well you forced my hand you're gonna watch us build it and then we're gonna eat you I wonder if they're just over there like are they really mad Raiders don't take you seriously okay fine you've left us no choice take them prisoner traitors don't take their threats seriously demand resources the traders don't take their threats seriously trade trade refused okay you guys are those refused this should have just let us eat you you and X are gonna build a smelter but it has a beautiful little icon right here this is fire starter just for now I'm gonna build it a little far away Oh God should I be afraid can't I just Ram them like anything else where are these pirates so these the Pirates AHA lopoliths well I don't know if those are the Pirates but Oh oh god I think those are the Pirates call it a hunch oh geez this isn't good okay guys go fight them or cower as they torch all your buildings yeah that'll teach you oh boy they brought more well that thing was meant to be on fire I guess this is just how it goes I'm gonna go ahead and say that the Pirates are successful judging by all the beatings that my guys are getting guess that'll teach me resources lost 16 they took some of my wood and left that's it oh you know that could have been worse I think we have no choice but to take safe harbor and yea hollow vocalist all that thought looks like we got a friend here yeah dumb fellows where'd he go come here come here well we're gonna catch ya oh yes we are we are gonna catch oh no no no no no oh thank God finally we didn't kill someone finally someone willing to trade I would like all your food and now I'm gonna make demands your city's demands were unsuccessful wow we are the least threatening group of people invade your city I started a battle oh my god they have a lot of people you know I think this was a bad idea can we leave damn it hey guys I changed my mind am i winning this fight it's really hard to tell I'm gonna go with no okay note to self don't fight other people quite yet okay Wilson's back free us getting our ass kicked by that tiny little town okay this time we're gonna build a guard house we need wood and we need metal gonna fire up the smelter here says that guy that's power walking all the way over there to go smoke up behind the building oh my god he kind of is now we're slowly but surely making sweet sweet metal that's we have enough of that sweet sweet metal we're gonna make this sweet sweet guard tower and then we're gonna do some sweet sweet killing jeez cool it's that time again I haven't even had a chance to build the guard thing yet to know the hell with it let's go right for him huh huh where do you think you're going yeah you like that you want some too Oh fiddlesticks will it kind of worked look at those guys just merrily taking all my supplies I gotta say for piracy that was really cordial ok protip and you see the Pirates aim them at your town center that way they can go straight to your resources and not worry about anything else oh man look at this true warrior this thing needs to move and he's not gonna let anything stop them ok I admire all of your courage here but maybe let's put out the fire first see hungry man has the idea honestly probably my favorite thing in the entire game is the grunting they make when they have to row see isn't that just priceless oh my God look all the supplies this guy has to deal with we've been like harvesting this trash pile here and now this guy seems to be very unhappy okay thank God now we have enough to build a guard house so we're gonna finally do that Clara is unhappy with city management and left with some supplies really where did she just do it like rose and Titanic and just grab like a door and float away Roman was strangled by Martin somebody stop him oh my god did he just throw him in the water that was great yeah that unhappy man just built the guard house finally some dudes with Spears oh boy here we go hope it they're in for a treat this time aren't they there are you guys I want to make sure I'm ready for you this time a sea trade federation trading ship has been spotted on the horizon no time for pirates except docking request yes boss rumble of God well this is awkward pirates are here maybe that other ship will come help us okay everybody fight guards guards you want to fight oh now you guys want to trade I mean I guess we're gonna lose all this stuff anyway I'll take 45 whale please hey thanks for the help by the way yeah good doing business with you okay you guys fight well there they go seriously what did you guys do did you do anything okay next time the city is under siege I expect more out of you okay pirates are coming back you for this is your chance trying to rotate this bad boy I'm gonna need all the units fighting come on come on come on they're gonna try it yeah yeah yeah if we can't hit this other dude no that's time to take them where's my guards guys guys you want to go fight I don't feel like that's defending the town guys seriously what do I need to do all I know is it's time for us to go on the offensive everything's gonna be all about these guard towers a tower that fires large harpoons and excels at shooting enemy ground units oh Christ if it's not one thing it's another with you that's final this shimmy out of the way again I said shimmy out of the way okay cool I guess we're not shimming out of the way okay cool thanks nature really did me a solid I didn't want that foundry anyway okay see here's what we need we need this harpoon earth we can just go after whales all day long I'm gonna put this on the edge of my fissure stuff over here then we can just aim that part of the boat at the bad guys and by bad guys I mean the whales there's a whale now just hurl well this feels bad apparently the way you harvest whale you just throw harpoons forever at it it's so clinical when you do it this way then you bring stuff over to the butcher over here he's making little mini fish out of the big fish it's not serial killer at all of him Oh Sydney died to scurvy wait what are you doing with her now well I guess I don't know what I was expecting another town my god I'm so excited to talk to another group of people except remember to not say or do anything weird cuz then they might kill me hey fellas what you doing excuse me can we recruit three villagers impressed by your city strength have been recruited can I recruit again no more villagers want to join your city what if I click demand your demands were successful you're an 18 scrap metal was received let's see if this works this time here is the conflict I was hoping for oh yeah just do all the kicks you take out that grandpa on a fair fight victory quick any resource you don't want to loot are you kidding me all mine by now that I've got a taste for it that's all I want to do okay so I'm expecting nothing great from this but we're gonna build our harpoon towers now or should I say a harpoon tower oh boy pirates are coming it's time to try out my thing tower thing oh yeah prepare to feel the might oh hell yeah it's totally shootin yep total success that harpoon tower was really worth it okay you know what so we keep getting screwed over by pirates really taking its toll on our population I got an idea I think I know how I can protect us from pirates while we harvest so I don't have any wood right and all of these things take wood to make but it'll still let me start making it so I build a bunch of stuff and I disconnected it from my actual base right like it's still built on do it another some pirates coming in theory I might be able to get this in the way and stop them there you go get your raiding party out here and also because your stuff isn't connected eventually it's just gonna sink into the ground good bye enemy forces and these dudes over here just kind of hang out on the outskirts while my guys over here are safe this guy's having a really good time just chillin underwater unfortunately this softlocks the game forever these dudes never leave no matter how many of their other guys you kill and eventually everybody dies of poor nourishment because you run out of food and the only thing left to drink is beer okay that one was kind of a lost cause but I've got a new idea now boats for days all right here we are again like God we can move so fast cuz we're so light I've got my mom little guy here like the foraging and fishing stuff on one side over here on the other side we're gonna build something hilarious and confusing okay so that'll do for now I think just kind of keeps going and going and going and here's the best part about this is I could just swing this thing around yeah let's pick up all those resources come here hey you over there do you want to trade like how if I want to trade with these guys again I just sort of wave this around get it close enough for the prompt shows up again now I'll just demand some resources for a while and then once they stop taking any of that seriously I just give them a little taste of my medicine like I can't even see my ship anymore I'm just this weird tentacle off the side of the screen that collects resources just cleaning up the ocean for everyone so I actually can't turn the ship yet because I need my rowers to be back in position and they're busy picking up supplies right now so while we wait I'll just go ahead and add to this oh there's a storm inbound ok mobilize shimmy your way over oh god do you see the storm it's way over there in the distance just keep just keep on spinning oh god it's getting closer okay okay keep spinning okay just barely made it out of there just so long as my reach is safe and boy is it oh my people keep dying now because they're taking so long to get these resources back that they just starve to death the things you just don't think about when you build a windshield wiper for a ship okay you know what I think I see where I went wrong boats for days - new spelling of boats let's do it old it a little bit more like it's a hideous drone and now that we've built up a little bit of wood and we just add it to all sides cuz really it was the distance that was a problem right matching this windmill coming at you hey guys can we do some quick trading actually you know what never mind I'm good junk land eeeh you better watch out I'm coming for you what do you think should we invade I feel like we got more people than they do how we're walked to the battlefield oh wow they've got weapons and stuff that's not good Retreat gasp survivors raft can you imagine if this was coming at you you're like oh my god I'm finally rescued but now I don't know if I want to be alright well I feel pretty good about this this game is pretty fun I'm looking forward to seeing where it goes and early-access that's gonna do it I hope you had fun I definitely did I give it four out of four raft propellers and I'll see you next time,13:08
37KieyXOYG4,JRE Clips,Blog,Jamie Foxx on Robert Downey Jr. Doing Blackface - Joe Rogan,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37KieyXOYG4,4 years ago,25M views,Blog,hello freak [ __ ] i mean i did i did one i did jimmy fallon one succeeding that jimmy fallon in every organization wanted to get me what did you say i was doing a joke uh of singing uh we were singing these funny songs about who let the dogs out and so we took who let the dogs out and put it in like a um like a like a vaudeville or show tune who left the dogs at whatever it was right but beginning of that i sort of ad lib like i was watching these dogs and they were coming towards me and i was wondering you know who let them out and there was a pit bull there and you know you have to be careful because pit bulls can be cantankerous you know and then i go into the song the pit bull community it was like jamie foxx station pitbull shamed us and then there was another thing where jimmy fallon was doing um was doing some type of uh he was saying what was going to be on the next show and i was doing a bad version of signing which i actually know how to sign i was doing a bad version you know sign language i know sign language we'll talk more about it later you know all those types of different things but as i was doing it as a joke i didn't know that the person that he was talking about happened to be deaf oh no oh my god and so then you know so it was just all of these things and i tried to tell people i said hey listen we never mean anything bad we poke fun but we're not we don't mean anything bad but you can't just you know you can't you you can't kill us because i gotta keep doing what i do you know so it's it's getting tougher well it's just what we're talking about about social media about uh people commenting on things that you can't read the comments there's just too many people yeah and people are always looking for something to be recreationally outraged at yeah in the comments to get that ass too the comment comment to hit you right where you are sometimes damn this [ __ ] is right well it's good too though a little bit i mean they're right when they're actually right like someone can say something ridiculous about you and if you know it's ridiculous it doesn't mean anything but if it's got a hint of truth you're like but when somebody said something about your teeth you you kind of look in the mirror i don't understand that i gotta i got [ __ ] up i got i got somebody hit me with the donkey the you know this [ __ ] donkey i was like ah i'll start talking like you know you know so you know but i tell people all the time don't read the comments that's the book don't read the comments because it will make you start to change the way you do things if i read all of the comments i never tell another joke yeah if i read all the comments i'll never try another you know i got a movie that we just uh shot for little or nothing called all star weekend and the jokes are like all the way out there you know and it's i got everybody in it you know and we're all taking we all play different characters like i play a white racist white racist cop and how do you do that i'll show it to you i'll grab the same show to you but it's uh robert downey jr plays a mexican gerard butler plays a russian who loves gymnastics uh benicio del toro plays this crazy tattoo artist and we're all you know we're all doing our thing so it's like if you read the comments that'll make you tuck that in but this is some brilliant and it's it's a cool little thing too it's it's called all-star weekend for a reason it's about two guys one guy loves steph curry the other guy loves lebron james and all they're trying to do is get to the all-star game and it's sort of like this whole journey of running all these people so it's dope but it is some things where it's like oh you know you could see there's gonna be some some [ __ ] going on well robert johnny jr just from tropic thunder think about that you could never do that anymore you can't have blackface anymore yeah you know what i'll say this people have to understand where it comes from there are real people out there that really mean you harm like outside of us i mean there's some real people who really don't [ __ ] like you whatever you are whether you're black you're white you're straight you're gay whatever it is there's some people who really don't like we're the entertainment and it's easy we're easy targets we're easy it's easy for you to jump on robert downey jr or jamie fox or joe because it's easy you know when it's real things which you know whether it's politics whether it's whatever a lot of times we we sort of we're not ready for that fight but it's easy to sort of pick the comedian i call robert i said listen i need you to play a mexican he says dude uh here's the deal sure [ __ ] it sure why not [ __ ] it sure of course you know mexican whatever but then he texts back and said i'm nervous to play the mexican i said well [ __ ] you played the black dude and you killed that [ __ ] we're just all you know we got to be able to do character what kind of blowback did he get from playing the black dude none because we [ __ ] up before the wire too though it was like what year was tropic thunder i feel like that was like 10 years ago it was wow but but here's the thing we [ __ ] with robert downey jr like that's our guy right like i did his birthday party and my first joke was how dare you take all of these roles from black people you know anyway everybody's laughing so it's sort of like the entertainers man should we you got to give us room you know what i'm saying like to to play any i'll show you when i gotta take that realm you gotta take it you can't worry about i saw chappelle somewhere was like you know they would ask him about his jokes and he's like yo man look you know people have said worst [ __ ] and i think he said something about donald trump saying grab about a [ __ ] or some [ __ ] whatever but it was true it was like the one thing uh that you look at what happened with politics this year people sort of stripped away a lot of things you know i'm saying regardless of what you believed in uh who whatever person you voted for it was a lot of things that were sort of addressed about like maybe we were playing things a little too close like some of those politicians were afraid to say what donald trump was saying and they ended up being left in the dust because people were a little like well well he's he's got a point in the sense of we're playing things a little too close [Music] [Applause] [Music] you,6:12

today i'm joined by keegan michael key jordan peel together their key and peel and they star in keanu in theaters april 29th a film that explores the age-old question how far is a man willing to go to save his adorable kitty cat it's a question that's been asked for millennia very funny i saw it last night the first spit take of my adult life actually i had a you have a good film the first one the first spit take of my adult life don't want to miss quote but i was taking a very very usual suspect i was taking a very deep sip of sprite swinging white noise wordness to the turdness oh my god and unbelievable right back in the right end of the cup this is a text i sent uh keegan a couple of years ago and then we had the potential i can't remember i wish i could remember what the context of it was to determine all right you guys ready ready [Music] so we have double the talent half as many wings this time overnight first wings special treats hot ones firey chipotle it's actually our sauce this is your sauce made by homeboys distributed by heatness you can find it online already mouth is watering thank you one of the things that kind of stands out to me in the movie is method man's performance yeah and that guy has a ton of roles over the years and many of them are comedic roles which kind of flies in the face of what i think a lot of people think of when they think of method man he's very um he's very much a real guy he has the same problems that any of us have he just sounds a lot cooler when he talks about them he literally was pacing on set one day completely frustrated yeah because the principal is these two kids are the same age uh which were commonly known as twins um they had the graduation and he was getting very upset because he was going this ridiculous man superintendent i'm gonna tell me i'm gonna get three tickets i should get six [ __ ] tickets this is ridiculous man i got two children how's my auntie supposed to see my my babies i mean they helped raise my kids so they go to mathematics and everything that's some stupid [ __ ] i gotta make a phone call i mean it's like mundane school stuff he never rapped about this never rapped about this josh and it's kind of funny to see a guy like method man have just everyday normal people oh my god right yeah he has to wake up one shoe at a time like the rest of us doesn't wake up yeah he wakes up one shoe at a time that's a saying people say that every day someone said that this morning this guy back here said it i guarantee it all right you ready for number two hot ones

about we were talking the big game oh no that's crazy he he was uh i was present that that was the most that was the most precious thing i wasn't freaking out i wasn't having an autobiography experience but having the ability to touch him and he was perfectly cool at that when we rehearsed it which was that was awesome being able to touch him and also i guess the best one would have been with uh michelle michelle you're right brother you okay were you a little nervous about touching him for the first time do you think like security like secret service would change oh wow oh my god well he runs into the room and runs up to me and he bro hugs me and i'm like let me i'm not doing it i'm not doing it take please you can feel like a red dot on your forehead like he grabs that's a problem i think anybody gets good because he's just up there hugging just just grabbing phones people he loves to be hugging joints yeah j-o-i-n-k-s joint joint joints you don't speak at ease that's why you may hit me he be hugging joints tell him a joint because hey any person that comes in uh to a room that it just looks huggable you know so he'd be like he'd be hugging joints no don't be

fascinated by the idea of camping awesome camp awesome and all these sketches that don't see the light of the day isn't that the purgatory that you guys put the sketches that don't make them out of the light the deepest most referential [ __ ] we can't remember that we're blind but that is correct sure so sean i'm having a stroke and you're going for more bites that's admirable you gotta keep up you already gave up my brother what are you most upset about not seeing the light of day there has to be something in that can that's waterproof you'll see water sketch the water sketch disgust where we're just in a battle water oh just bring that sketch we are swimming and drowning happily what was the question what sketch in camp awesome are you so upset that it just hasn't seen the light of day that nobody will ever see it there's got to be something in that can that you're like damn it that can nobody wants did he send the water sketch yeah there's this milk sketch in that uh oh mix it up no scratches looks like this is the one for me all right you guys ready to do this last one last one you know what sean so this is yeah you go to hell i want you to look at the consistency of this now so this is don't touch it with your bare hands it's kind of traditional give me just a second take a walk take a lap to dab last one dab it let me dab the lid grab your own ass off man dab your own ass and then you guys you know what if you don't whose [ __ ] idea was this show you don't want it you don't have to that's a big dab are you do you have like a unrealistic chernobyl he's got one of those things your whole inside is made out of like some kind of synthetic because yeah like i'm uh like it's not fair yeah the inside of your body is made out of asbestos it's like remembering the princess bride when the guy had like built up the immunity to the [ __ ] poison that's where i'm at that's you you're the dreaded private robber okay what what happened to this whole thing and then people are you at all impressed with this or is it just it just seems like a a type of madness like maybe i should go get something checked out it seems like you figured out something you can do and you built a whole show around it that's what it seems like isn't that what we did oh yeah more power to you oh you go to hell sean all right so for this last wing if you don't want to dab you don't have to dab some people are going to die why are you going to bring up dabbing man i'm going to i'm going to dab you got to dab you got to you're not gonna dab so and then this last question i'm gonna bring it full circle i'm going from the second city main stage god from key and people this guy's got the deep cuts all the way to keanu okay so there's a little dab my favorite characters ever were the valets but did you see that liam nieces movie with them wolves though the one with them big ass wolves and liam nieces is my [ __ ] and they probably would have been so hyped to see keanu so for this last one let's all take a bite yep and we'll all die and then i want to sort of re-imagine no don't doubt that much how the how the valets would talk about keanu after seeing it does that sound like a good plan oh you dabbed out all right cheers i'm just trying to spread this dab out dab it out that's a sick dab dab step so i don't like the way he did it i don't like the way he did it all fast she was scared yo you see that you're sweating you see that key in people's movies that movie was fine that movie was fire i don't even know what i'm about to say the dog movie yeah i'll give
